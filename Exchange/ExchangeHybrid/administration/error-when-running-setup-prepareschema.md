# Error when running Setup /PrepareSchema to prepare the schema for an existing Exchange hybrid environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3121439

## Symptoms

When you run Exchange Server Setup together with the `/PrepareSchema` to update the schema for an existing Exchange hybrid environment, you receive the following error message:

> A hybrid deployment with Office 365 has been detected. Please ensure that you are running setup with the /TenantOrganizationConfig switch. To use the TenantOrganizationConfig switch you must first connect to your Exchange Online tenant via PowerShell and execute the following command: "Get-OrganizationConfig | Export-Clixml -Path MyTenantOrganizationConfig.XML". Once the XML file has been generated, run setup with the TenantOrganizationConfig switch as follows "/TenantOrganizationConfig MyTenantOrganizationConfig.XML".
>
> If you continue to see this this message then it indicates that either the XML file specified is corrupt, or you are attempting to upgrade your on-premises Exchange installation to a build that isn't compatible with the Exchange version of your Microsoft 365 tenant. Your Microsoft 365 tenant must be upgraded to a compatible version of Exchange before upgrading your on-premises Exchange installation.

When you follow the instructions in the error message to generate the XML file, and then you run `Setup /PrepareSchema` together with the `/TenantOrganizationConfig` switch, you receive the following error message:

> The parameter 'TenantOrganizationConfig' is not valid for current operation 'PrepareSchema'. Setup checks failed: Invalid command line arguments.

## Cause

The `/PrepareSchema` switch is valid only for schema operations. The `/TenantOrganizationConfig` switch is used with the `/PrepareAD` switch.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, run Setup together with the `/PrepareAD` and `/TenantOrganizationConfig` switches. For example, run the following command:

```powershell
Setup.exe /PrepareAD /TenantOrganizationConfig MyTenantOrganizationConfig.xml /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this scenario, schema extension is performed implicitly by running the `/PrepareAD` switch. Therefore, to complete these steps, you must have Schema Admin rights to perform the schema changes in addition to the rights that are necessary to perform the `/PrepareAD` steps.
