You are running a hybrid deployment of on-premises Exchange Server and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. When you click **hybrid** in the left navigation pane of the Exchange admin center on the on-premises Exchange 2013 server, you aren't redirected to the Microsoft 365 portal as expected. Instead, you receive an error message that resembles the following:
