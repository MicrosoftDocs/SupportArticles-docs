# Exchange Online users cannot access free/busy information of users in a non-Internet-facing Active Directory site

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration wizard. Instead, use the Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard that's available at [https://aka.ms/HybridWizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a hybrid deployment of Microsoft Exchange Online and on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server.
- The hybrid environment has two Active Directory sites.
- One Active Directory site is Internet-facing, and the other site is non-Internet-facing.

In this scenario, users who have mailboxes in Exchange Online cannot access free/busy information of on-premises users who have mailboxes in the non-Internet-facing Active Directory site.

Additionally, an event ID 4002 entry that resembles the following is logged in the Application log every time that an Exchange Online mailbox in the Internet-facing site makes an availability request to an on-premises mailbox in the non-Internet-facing site.

Make sure that the Active Directory site or forest that contains the user's mailbox has at least one local server that is running Exchange Server that is also running the Availability service. Turn up logging for the Availability service, and then test basic network connectivity.

## Cause

The certificate that's used to create the federation with Exchange Online is not installed on the Exchange servers in the non-Internet-facing site.

## Resolution

Export the federation certificates from the Internet-facing Exchange servers, and then import them to the non-Internet-facing Exchange servers.

## More information

For more information about how to export certificates in Exchange Server, see the following resources:
