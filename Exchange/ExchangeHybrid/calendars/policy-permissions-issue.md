# Policy doesn't allow granting permissions at this level to one or more of the recipient(s) when sharing calendar

## Problem

A Microsoft 365 user tries to share their calendar with an on-premises user or an external user. Or, an on-premises user tries to share their calendar with a Microsoft 365 user or an external user. In either scenario, the user who tries to share their calendar to the cross-premises user receives the following error message:

> Policy does not allow granting permissions at this level to one or more of the recipient(s). Please select another permission level and send the sharing invite again.

## Cause

This problem occurs if the sharing policy doesn't allow the user to share the level of detail that the user set in the sharing invitation.

## Solution

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Do one of the following, as appropriate for your situation:
   - Connect to Exchange Online by using Remote PowerShell. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
   - On the on-premises server, open the Exchange Management Shell.

2. Determine the sharing policy that's assigned to the user. To do this, run the following command and note the policy returned:

    ```powershell
    Get-Mailbox User1 | fl *sharing*
    ```

3. Update the sharing policy for the user. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Open the Exchange admin center.
   2. Click **Organization**, and then double-click the policy that's assigned to the user under **Individual Sharing**. This is the policy that was returned in step 2.
   3. On the Sharing Rule page, select the calendar sharing level that you want to allow under **Specify what information you want to share**, and then click **Save**.
