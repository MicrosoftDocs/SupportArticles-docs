# Microsoft Exchange Online Mail Flow Diagnostic

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2982028

## Introduction

The Microsoft Exchange Online Mail Flow Diagnostic tool Support Diagnostics Platform (SDP) package collects sender, recipient and contact, connectors, and message trace information from your on-premises and Exchange Online organizations.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - This diagnostic package is produced specifically for customers who have both an on-premises Exchange Server organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365 (hybrid deployment).
> - All file names in the data collection are prefaced with \<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.
> - Information that's collected will depend on whether the sender or recipient has a mailbox or is a mail contact in your Exchange Online organization.
> - When the diagnostic is prompted, message trace information will be collected for the sender-recipient pair and date (plus or minus one day) that you enter.
