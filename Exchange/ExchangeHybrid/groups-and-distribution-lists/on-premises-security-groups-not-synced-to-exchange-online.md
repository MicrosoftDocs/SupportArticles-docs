# On-premises security groups are not synced to Exchange Online in a hybrid deployment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2988761

## Symptoms

In your hybrid deployment of on-premises Exchange Server and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365, you notice that some on-premises security groups are not synced to Exchange Online.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the on-premises security groups are not mail-enabled. In a hybrid deployment, only security groups that are mail-enabled are synced to Exchange Online. This behavior is by design.
