# "1007 AccessDenied" or "Ensure your system time is correct" error when you run Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3107293

## Symptoms

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive one of the following error messages:

> Set-FederatedOrganizationIdentifier': An error occurred while attempting to provision Exchange to the Partner STS. Detailed Information "An unexpected result was received from Windows Live. Detailed information: "1007 AccessDenied: Access Denied.".".

> Unable to federate your domain, your system time appears to be more than five minutes out of sync with the time on our federation servers. Ensure your system time is correct and retry the Hybrid Configuration Wizard.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the local system time is out of sync with a valid time server. This problem occurs if the system time of your local system and the system time of the server from which you're running the Hybrid Configuration wizard differ by five minutes or more.

## Resolution

Make sure that your local system time and the server time are in sync. For more information about how to do this, see [How to configure an authoritative time server in Windows Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/816042).
