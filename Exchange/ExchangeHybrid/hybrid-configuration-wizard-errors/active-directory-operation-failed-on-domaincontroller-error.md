# Active Directory operation failed on DomainController error when you run Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3067609

## Symptoms

You want to set up a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. However, when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, the wizard doesn't complete successfully, and you receive an **Active Directory operation failed on \<DomainController>.\<Domain>.com. The object \<DistinguishedName> does not exist** error message. The full text of this message resembles the following:

> ERROR:Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'Subtask Configure execution failed: Configure Mail FlowExecution of the Set-ReceiveConnector cmdlet had thrown an exception. This may indicate invalid parameters in your Hybrid Configuration settings. Active Directory operation failed on <**DomainController**>.contoso.com. The object 'CN=Inbound from Microsoft 365,CN=SMTP Receive Connectors,CN=Protocols,CN' does not exist.
