# HCW8008 Server doesn't have the Client Access server role installed when you run the HCW

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3087157

## Problem

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard (HCW), you receive the following error message:

> HCW8008 The server \<ServerName> is listed as a Client Access server in the HybridConfiguration Active Directory object, but it doesn't have the Client Access server role installed.

## Cause

This problem may occur if you removed the Client Access server role from a server that you selected as one of the receiving Client Access servers in the Hybrid Configuration wizard.

## Solution

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

- Install the Client Access server role on the server.
- Run the Hybrid Configuration wizard again. On the page on which you specify the receiving Client Access servers, select a server that has the Client Access server role installed.
