# HCW8039 The hybrid Send connector must only contain the single address space error when you run HCW

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3087172

## Problem

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard (HCW), you receive the following error message:

> HCW8039 The hybrid Send connector must only contain the single address space '{0}'

## Cause

This issue occurs if the Send connector that's created by the Hybrid Configuration wizard has additional namespaces added to it.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Exchange Management Shell.
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-SendConnector -name "Outbound to Office 365"
    ```

3. In the output, examine the value of the AddressSpace  parameter. You should see either "*" or "contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com;1."
4. If you see any addresses other than "*" or "contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com;1", remove them. To do this, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-SendConnector -name "Outbound to Office 365 "smtp:contoso.mail.onmicrosoft.com;1"
    ```

5. Run the Hybrid Configuration wizard again.
