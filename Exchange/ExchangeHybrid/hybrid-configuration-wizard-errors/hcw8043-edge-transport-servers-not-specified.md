# HCW8043 Edge Transport servers cannot be specified error when you run Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3087173

## Problem

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive the following error message:

> HCW8043 Edge Transport servers cannot be specified with receiving Client Access or sending Mailbox servers.

## Cause

This issue occurs if you selected an edge server on the page of the Hybrid Configuration wizard where you specify sending and receiving servers.

## Solution

Run the Hybrid Configuration wizard again, and remove the edge server that you specified on the pages of the wizard where you specify sending and receiving servers.

The sending server must be an Exchange 2013 mailbox server, and the receiving server must be an Exchange 2013 Client access server.
