# HCW8091 error when you run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3185379

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration Wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration Wizard. Instead, use the Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration Wizard that's available at [https://aka.ms/HybridWizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).

## Symptoms

When you run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard, you receive the following error message:

> HCW8091 = WinRM service is not enabled

## Cause

This problem occurs if a required service isn't running on the server that's running Exchange Server to complete the underlying PowerShell session.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the server that's running Exchange Server, select **Start**, select **Run**, type *Services.msc*, and then press Enter.
2. In the list of services, look for the Windows Remote Management service, and then make sure that it's running.
3. Run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard again from [https://aka.ms/HybridWizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard).
