# Hybrid domain isn't an accepted domain for the cloud organization error when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3067179

## Symptoms

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive a **Hybrid domain \<Domain> isn't an accepted domain for the cloud organization** error message. The full text of this message resembles the following:

> ERROR:Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'Subtask CheckPrereqs execution failed: Check Prerequisites
Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Common.LocalizedException: Hybrid domain `contoso.com` isn't an accepted domain for the cloud organization.  
Hybrid domain `contoso.com` isn't an accepted domain for the cloud organization.

## Cause

This problem occurs if the accepted domain is missing.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that domains are added to your on-premises organization as accepted domains. For more information, see [Accepted domains](/exchange/accepted-domains-exchange-2013-help).

2. Make sure that domains are added to Microsoft Exchange Online as accepted domains. For more information, see [Verify a domain at any domain name registrar](/previous-versions/azure/jj151803(v=azure.100)).

3. Rerun the Hybrid Configuration wizard. When you're prompted to add your domain or domains, select the domains that you added. For more information, see step 5 of [Create a hybrid deployment with the Hybrid Configuration Wizard](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/deploy-hybrid).
