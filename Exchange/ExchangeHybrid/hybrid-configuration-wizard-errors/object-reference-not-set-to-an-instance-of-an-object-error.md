# Object reference not set to an instance of an object error when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3067696

## Symptoms

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive the following error message:

> ERROR: Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'Subtask CheckPrereqs execution failed: Creating Organization Relationships.  
Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

## Cause

The hybrid object is missing from the Active Directory domain. For example, this can occur if the object was deleted.

## Resolution 1 - Rerun setup /prepareAD

1. On the server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server, open a Command Prompt window as an administrator, and then change to the folder in which the Exchange installation files are stored.

2. Run the following command:

    ```console
    setup /prepareAD
    ```

3. Restart the server.
4. Rerun the Hybrid Configuration wizard.

## Resolution 2 - Perform an authoritative restore of the hybrid object

Restore the hybrid object that was deleted from the following location:

CN=Configuration,DC=\<DOMAIN>,DC=\<COM>,CN=Services,CN=Microsoft Exchange,CN=\<ORGANIZATIONAME>,CN=Hybrid Configuration

For more information about how to do this, see [Performing Authoritative Restore of Active Directory Objects](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc816878(v=ws.10)).
