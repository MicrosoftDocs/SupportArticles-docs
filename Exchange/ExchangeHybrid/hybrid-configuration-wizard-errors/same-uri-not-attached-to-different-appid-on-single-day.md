# Same URI cannot be attached to different AppId on a single day when you run HCW

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3027942

## Problem

When you run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard in an Exchange Online environment, you receive the following error message:

> An error occurred while attempting to provision Exchange to the Partner STS.
>
> Detailed Information "An unexpected result was received from Windows Live.  
> Detailed information: "MaxUriReached MaxUriReached: Same URI cannot be attached to different AppId on a single day."
>
> An unexpected result was received from Windows Live.  
> Detailed information: "MaxUriReached MaxUriReached: Same URI cannot be attached to different AppId on a single day."
>
> MaxUriReached: Same URI cannot be attached to different AppId on a single day.

## Cause

This problem occurs if there were too many failed attempts to create a federation trust. To prevent malicious behavior, we limit the number of failed attempts to federate a domain. The counter for this action is reset within 24 hours.

## Solution

Wait 24 hours from when you receive the error message, and then rerun the Hybrid Configuration Wizard to create the federation trust.
