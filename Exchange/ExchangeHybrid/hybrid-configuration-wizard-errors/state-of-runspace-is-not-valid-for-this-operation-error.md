# (State of runspace is not valid for this operation) error when running Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3067613

## Symptoms

You want to set up a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Exchange Server organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. However, when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, the wizard doesn't complete successfully. You receive a **State of runspace is not valid for this operation** error message. The full text of this message resembles the following:

> ERROR:Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'Subtask CheckPrereqs execution failed: Creating Organization Relationships.
>
> Execution of the Get-FederatedOrganizationIdentifier cmdlet had thrown an exception. This may indicate invalid parameters in your Hybrid Configuration settings.
>
> State of runspace is not valid for this operation.
>
> Cannot perform operation because the runspace pool is not in the 'Opened' state. The current state is 'Broken'.
