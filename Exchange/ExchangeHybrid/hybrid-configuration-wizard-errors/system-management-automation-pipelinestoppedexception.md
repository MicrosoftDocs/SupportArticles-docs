## Symptoms

You want to set up a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. However, when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, the wizard doesn't complete successfully. You receive a **System.Management.Automation.PipelineStoppedException: The pipeline has been stopped** error message. The full text of the message resembles the following:
