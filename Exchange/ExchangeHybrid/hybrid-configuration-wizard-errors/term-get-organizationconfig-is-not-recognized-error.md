# (The term Get-OrganizationConfig is not recognized) error when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3067676

## Symptoms

You want to set up a hybrid deployment between your on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server organization and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. However, when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, the wizard doesn't complete successfully, and you receive a **Get-OrganizationConfig is not recognized** error message. The full text of this message resembles the following example:

> ERROR : Subtask CheckPrereqs execution failed: Check Tenant Prerequisites  
Execution of the Get-OrganizationConfig cmdlet has thrown an exception. This may indicate invalid parameters in your hybrid configuration settings.  
The term 'Get-OrganizationConfig' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

## Cause

The Hybrid Configuration wizard depends on the availability of a Microsoft 365 plan that can access the `Get-HybridMailflowDatacenterIPs` cmdlet. The error message indicates that the subscriptions that you currently have can't access this cmdlet.

## Workaround

Add a trial subscription of Office 365 E3 to your account. After you add the Office 365 E3 plan, the Hybrid Configuration wizard will complete successfully. To add a trial subscription, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://www.office.com/?auth=2).
2. Select **Admin** to open the Microsoft 365 admin center.
3. In the navigation pane, expand **Billing**, select **Subscriptions**, and then select **New Subscription**.
4. Under **Office 365 Enterprise E3**, select **Trial**, and then follow the steps that are displayed on the screen.For more help to work around this issue, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/).
