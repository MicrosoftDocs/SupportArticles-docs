# "Unable to determine the routing domain for the cloud organization" error when running Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3068010

## Symptoms

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive an **Unable to determine the routing domain for the cloud organization** error message. The full text of this message resembles the following:

> ERROR:Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'Subtask CheckPrereqs execution failed: Check Prerequisites  
Microsoft.Exchange.Data.Common.LocalizedException: Unable to determine the routing domain for the cloud organization.  
Unable to determine the routing domain for the cloud organization.  
at Microsoft.Exchange.Management.Hybrid.Engine.ExecuteTask(ITask taskBase, ITaskContext taskContext)

## Resolution

Enable directory synchronization. When directory synchronization is enabled, the routing domain is created. To enable directory synchronization, follow these steps:

1. Connect to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using Windows PowerShell. For more information about how to do so, see [Connect to Azure AD](/powershell/azure/active-directory/overview?view=azureadps-1.0#connect-to-azure-ad&preserve-view=true).
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirsync $true
    ```
