# The user isn't assigned to any management roles when you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3058293

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration wizard. Instead, use the [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).

## Problem

When you run the Hybrid Configuration wizard, you receive the following error message:

> ERROR:Updating hybrid configuration failed with error 'System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingTransportException: Processing data from remote server failed with the following error message: The user "\<>/Users/Administrator" isn't assigned to any management roles. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.

## Cause

The user account that you're using to run the Hybrid Configuration wizard doesn't have sufficient permissions.

## Solution

You must be an Exchange administrator to run the Hybrid Configuration wizard. To resolve this problem, add the administrator account to the Domain Admins group or to another group whose permissions resemble those of the Domain Admins group.
