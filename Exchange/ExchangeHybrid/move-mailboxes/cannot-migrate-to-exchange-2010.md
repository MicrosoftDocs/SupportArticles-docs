# Can't move Exchange Online mailboxes to Exchange Server 2010

In an Exchange Server hybrid deployment, if you try to move Exchange Online mailboxes to on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, you receive the following error message:

> MigrationPermanentException: **Moving mailbox to Exchange version 'Version 14.x (Build \<build number>\)' is not supported**. Mailboxes can be moved to Exchange Server 2013 and later versions only. --> Moving mailbox to Exchange version 'Version 14.x (Build \<build number>\)' is not supported. Mailboxes can be moved to Exchange Server 2013 and later versions only.

This issue occurs because [Exchange Server 2010 has reached the end of support](/microsoft-365/enterprise/exchange-2010-end-of-support). Microsoft no longer supports moving mailboxes from Exchange Online to Exchange Server 2010.

You can move Exchange Online mailboxes to Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and later versions. To upgrade from Exchange Server 2010, see the following articles:

- [Upgrade from Exchange 2010 to Exchange 2013](/exchange/upgrade-from-exchange-2010-to-exchange-2013-exchange-2013-help)
- [Upgrade to a newer version of Exchange Server on-premises](/microsoft-365/enterprise/exchange-2010-end-of-support#upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-exchange-server-on-premises)
