# Can't move items between on-premises Exchange mailboxes and their cloud-based archive in OWA

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2970120

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration wizard. Instead, use the [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).

## Problem

In a hybrid deployment of on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange Online in Microsoft 365, users can't use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to move items between their primary mailbox in Exchange Server 2010 and their cloud-based archive.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. You can't use Outlook Web Access to move items between an on-premises Exchange Server 2010 mailbox and a cloud-based archive.

## Solution

Use Microsoft Outlook to move archived items.
