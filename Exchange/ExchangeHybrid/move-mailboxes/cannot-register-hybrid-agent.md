# Can't register a Hybrid Agent in Exchange Server

## Symptoms

When you use the Hybrid Configuration wizard (HCW) to set up a [Microsoft Hybrid Agent](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-agent), you see the following registration error in the HCW for the installed Hybrid Agent.

:::image type="content" source="media/cannot-register-hybrid-agent/hybrid-agent-registration-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Hybrid Agent registration error in the HCW." border="true":::

You also receive the following error entries in the HCW log:

```output
10333 \[Client=UX, fn=SendAsync, Thread=\<ID\>\] Results=NotFound {"error":
{"code":"Application_NotFound", "message":"Application '\<application GUID\>' not found or
OnPremisesPublishing is not enabled for your tenant."
```

```output
10333 \[Client=UX, fn=SendAsync, Thread=\<ID\>\] Results=BadRequest {"error":
{"code": "InternalUrl_Duplicate", "message":"Internal url '\<application URL\>' is invalid
since it is already in use."
```

## Cause

The errors occur if the internal URL that's used by the Hybrid Agent application is already in use within your organization. More specifically:

### Cause 1

The same internal URL is used by an existing enterprise on-premises app that uses [Microsoft Azure AD Application Proxy](/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy).

### Cause 2

The same internal URL is used by a previously installed, orphaned Hybrid Agent application that's not fully registered. An orphaned Hybrid Agent application can be caused by a failed Hybrid Agent installation or uninstallation.

## Resolution

Use the appropriate resolution, depending on the cause.

### Resolution for Cause 1

Choose one of the following options:

- Assign a different internal URL to the existing enterprise app. For more information, see [Add an on-premises application](/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application) and [Set-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication](/powershell/module/azuread/set-azureadapplicationproxyapplication).

- Remove the existing enterprise app. For more information, see [Remove-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication](/powershell/module/azuread/remove-azureadapplicationproxyapplication).

### Resolution for Cause 2

Remove the previously installed, orphaned Hybrid Agent application. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Get the application GUID of the previous Hybrid Agent application. You can find this GUID by searching the HCW log for the following entry:

   `10386 [Client=UX, Thread=<ID>] Previous Connector Application Name found: <application GUID>`

   The entry might resemble the following example:

   `10386 [Client=UX, Thread=20] Previous Connector Application Name found: 8fc44b37-bf0d-45bf-8254-d4d033d93a6e`

1. Remove the previous Hybrid Agent application. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Load the [HybridManagement PowerShell module](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-agent#installation-prerequisites):

      1. Install the [Microsoft PackageManagement PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PackageManagement).

      1. Install the [Microsoft Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/servicemanagement/install-azure-ps#step-2-install-azure-powershell).

      1. Download the latest version of the Microsoft [HybridManagement.psm1](https://aka.ms/hybridconnectivity) PowerShell module to a server in your Exchange organization.

      1. In the folder that contains the HybridManagement module, run the following PowerShell command as an administrator:

         ```powershell
         Import-Module .\HybridManagement.psm1
         ```

   1. Pass the application GUID that you found in step 1 to the [Remove-HybridApplication](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-agent#hybrid-agent-powershell-module) cmdlet:

      ```powershell
      Remove-HybridApplication -AppId <application GUID> -Credential (Get-Credential)
      ```

      Or, if you have MFA enabled, run:

      ```powershell
      Remove-HybridApplication -AppId <application GUID> -UserPrincipalName <tenant admin UPN>
      ```

      When you're prompted for credentials, enter your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 Global Administrator credentials.
1. Re-run the HCW in classic mode to unregister the Application Proxy service in Azure AD.
1. Go to **Programs and Features** in Control Panel, verify that **Microsoft Hybrid Service** isn't [installed](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/hybrid-agent#additional-information). If it is, re-run step 2 to remove the Hybrid Agent application.
1. Re-run the HCW in modern mode.
  
   > [!NOTE]
   > When you're prompted to choose a hybrid topology, select **Exchange Modern Hybrid Topology**.

If the Hybrid Agent application isn't successfully removed, use one of the following options:

- Run the following [Remove-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication](/powershell/module/azuread/remove-azureadapplicationproxyapplication) command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication -ObjectId <application GUID> -RemoveADApplication $true
   ```
 
- Run the following command to get the application GUID, and then run the `Remove-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication` command to remove the application: 
  
  ```powershell
  Get-AzureADServicePrincipal | where {$_.Tags -Contains "WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryOnPremApp"} | fl AppId, DisplayName
  ```
 
If you still can't remove the Hybrid Agent application, [contact Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).
