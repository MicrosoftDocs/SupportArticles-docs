# "Operation has timed out" error when using New-MoveRequest to move a mailbox from Exchange Online to on-premises

## Symptoms

You have a hybrid deployment of Microsoft Exchange Online in Microsoft 365 and of your on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server environment. When you try to use the New-MoveRequest Windows PowerShell cmdlet to move or offboard a mailbox from Microsoft 365 to the on-premises environment, the mailbox isn't moved. Additionally, you may receive an error message that resembles the following:

> The call to '`https://webmail.domain.com/EWS/mrsproxy.svc`' timed out.  
> The operation has timed out  
> \+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (0:Int32) [New-MoveRequest], RemoteTransientException  
> \+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : 725EBC5,Microsoft.Exchange.Management.RecipientTasks.NewMoveRequest

## Cause

This issue may occur if incorrect syntax is used for domain names and host names in the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, make sure that you use the correct syntax for domain names and host names in the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet. The `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet requires all domain names and host names to be enclosed in single quotation marks (').

The following is an example of incorrect syntax:

```ps
'alias' | New-MoveRequest -Outbound -RemoteHostName webmail.contoso.com -RemoteCredential $onprem -RemoteTargetDatabase Database1 -TargetDeliveryDomain contoso.com
```

The following is an example of correct syntax. (Note that this example uses single quotation marks around domain names and host names.)

```ps
'alias' | New-MoveRequest -OutBound -RemoteTargetDatabase 'Database1' -RemoteHostName 'webmail.contoso.com' -RemoteCredential $onprem -TargetDeliveryDomain 'contoso.com'
```

## More information
