# You must specify the PrimaryOnly parameter error when moving a primary mailbox to Exchange Online in a hybrid deployment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3160413

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration wizard. Instead, use the Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard that's available at [https://aka.ms/HybridWizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://blogs.technet.com/b/exchange/archive/2016/02/17/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010.aspx).

## Symptoms

You have a hybrid deployment of on-premises Exchange Server and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365 in which primary mailboxes are located in the on-premises environment and archive mailboxes are located in Exchange Online. When you try to move only a primary mailbox from the on-premises environment to Exchange Online by using the Exchange admin center in Microsoft 365, you receive the following error message.

> Error: MigrationPermanentException: You must specify the PrimaryOnly parameter

## Cause

The Exchange admin center doesn't have the option to move only a primary mailbox. To do this, you must use the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet.

## Resolution

To move only a primary mailbox, follow these steps:

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information about how to do this, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    New-MoveRequest -Identity <user@contoso.com> -RemoteCredential (Get-Credential) -Remote -RemoteHostName 'on-premises mrsproxy url' -BatchName <Name of Batch> -PrimaryOnly -TargetDeliveryDomain <mail.onmicrosoft.com domain>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you're prompted for credentials, enter your on-premises Exchange credentials.

For more information about the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet, see [New-MoveRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-moverequest?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).

## More information

You can also use the `New-MigrationBatch` cmdlet together with the `-PrimaryOnly` parameter to move only a primary mailbox. For more information, about this cmdlet, see [New-MigrationBatch](/powershell/module/exchange/new-migrationbatch?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).
