# How to use Outlook policy to control PST use and creation in the Office 365 Import service

## Introduction

When you use the Microsoft Office 365 Import service, you may want to control whether users can add new items to .pst files and how users use .pst files in Microsoft Outlook. This article describes how to prevent users from adding new items to an existing .pst file and how to prevent users from creating new .pst files during the import process.

## Procedure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this article carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

### Prevent users from adding new data or content to an existing .pst file

To prevent users from adding new data or content to an existing .pst file, add the **PSTDisableGrow** registry entry, and then set the value to **1**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Registry Editor.
1. Locate and select the following registry subkey. You have to create the key if it does not exist.

   |Type|Registry path|
   |-|-|
   |Group Policy|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Outlook\PST`|
   |Office Customization Tool (OCT)|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Outlook\PST`|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *xx*.0 placeholder represents the Outlook version (16.0 = Outlook 2016 and Outlook for Office 365, 15.0 = Outlook 2013, 14.0 = Outlook 2010, 12.0 = Outlook 2007).

1. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **DWORD Value**.
1. Type **PSTDisableGrow**, and then press Enter.
1. Right-click the **PSTDisableGrow** registry entry that you created, and then select **Modify**.
1. In the **Value data** box, type **1**, and then select **OK**.

The **PSTDisableGrow** registry entry can be set to the following values.

|Value|Description|
|-|-|
|0|User can add new items to an existing .pst file. This is the default value.|
|1|Use cannot add new content or data to an existing .pst file.|

### Prevent users from adding new .pst files

To prevent users from connecting a .pst file to Outlook, add the **DisablePST** registry entry, and then set the value to **1**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Registry Editor.
1. Locate and select the following registry subkey. You have to create the key if it does not exist.

   |Type|Registry path|
   |-|-|
   |Group Policy|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Outlook`|
   |Office Customization Tool (OCT)|`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Outlook`|

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *xx*.0 placeholder represents the Outlook version (16.0 = Outlook 2016 and Outlook for Office 365, 15.0 = Outlook 2013, 14.0 = Outlook 2010, 12.0 = Outlook 2007).

1. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **DWORD Value**.
1. Type **DisablePST**, and then press Enter.
1. Right-click the **DisablePST** registry entry that you created, and then select **Modify**.
1. In the **Value data** box, type **1**, and then select **OK**.

The **DisablePST** registry entry can be set to the following values.

|Value|Description|
|-|-|
|0|Users can add .pst files. This is the default value.|
|1|Users cannot add .pst files. However, in scenarios in which a .pst file was connected to Outlook before this registry value was added, the existing .pst file will still be connected. No new.pst files can be added.|
|2|Users can add only exclusive sharing .pst files, such as SharePoint .pst files.|
