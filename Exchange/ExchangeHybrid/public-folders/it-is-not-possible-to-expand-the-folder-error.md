# It is not possible to expand the folder error when accessing public folders in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3027606

## Symptoms

When you use Microsoft Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2016 to access Microsoft Exchange Server public folders in Microsoft Exchange Online, you receive the following error message:

> It is not possible to expand the folder. It is not possible to open folders. Microsoft Exchange is not available due to network issues or Exchange Server is disabled for maintenance

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps that are listed in [Configure legacy on-premises public folders for a hybrid deployment](/exchange/collaboration-exo/public-folders/set-up-legacy-hybrid-public-folders).

## More information

This issue occurs because the Exchange mailbox that holds the public folder doesn't have the Client Access Server (CAS) role enabled.
