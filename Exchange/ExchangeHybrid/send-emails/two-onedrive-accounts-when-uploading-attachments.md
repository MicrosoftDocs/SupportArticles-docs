# Two OneDrive accounts appear when uploading attachments from Outlook on the web

## Symptoms

When you try to upload attachments from Outlook on the web, the **Upload** menu displays two OneDrive accounts instead of one.

:::image type="content" source="media/two-onedrive-accounts-when-uploading-attachments/onedrive-accounts.png" alt-text="Screenshot of two OneDrive accounts on the Upload menu.":::

## Cause

This issue occurs if you're in a hybrid Exchange environment that has a mailbox on Microsoft Exchange Server on-premises and a OneDrive for Business account in Microsoft 365, and if the OneDrive account was moved to a different geographical location. After the OneDrive move, the internal and external My Site Host URLs are not updated in the `OwaMailboxPolicy` setting.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, use either of the following methods.

### Method 1: Update My Site Host URLs

Run the following cmdlet to update the internal and external My Site Host URLs in the `OwaMailboxPolicy` setting to the values for the new geographical location of OneDrive:

```powershell
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy Default -InternalSPMySiteHostURL <new_OneDrive_URL> -ExternalSPMySiteHostURL <new_OneDrive_URL>
```

### Method 2: Set values to Null

Run the following cmdlet to set the internal and external My Site Host URLs in the `OwaMailboxPolicy` setting to **Null**:

```powershell
Set-OwaMailboxPolicy Default -InternalSPMySiteHostURL $Null -ExternalSPMySiteHostURL $Null
```

After you update the `OwaMailboxPolicy` setting by using one of the methods, create a new Outlook profile to use the updated values. This is necessary because the previous `OwaMailboxPolicy` settings are cached in your current Outlook profile, and they can't be updated.

For more information about the `OwaMailboxPolicy` setting, see [Configure document collaboration with OneDrive for Business and Exchange 2016 on-premises](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/set-up-document-collaboration).
