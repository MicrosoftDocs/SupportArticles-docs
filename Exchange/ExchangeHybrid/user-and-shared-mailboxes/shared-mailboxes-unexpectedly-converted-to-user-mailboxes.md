# Shared mailbox in Exchange Online is unexpectedly disconnected

## Symptoms

In a hybrid environment, you migrate a regular mailbox from Microsoft Exchange Server to Exchange Online, and then convert the regular mailbox in Exchange Online to a shared mailbox. The shared mailbox in Exchange Online is unlicensed and doesn't have a hold applied. However, sometime after the conversion, the shared mailbox in Exchange Online becomes disconnected.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the mailbox type in Exchange Online no longer matches the mailbox type of the on-premises remote mailbox. Because the direction of synchronization is from on-premises to Exchange Online, the mismatch in the mailbox type can cause Exchange Online to later revert the shared mailbox to a regular mailbox. Exchange Online might disconnect a regular mailbox if it has no license assigned and no hold applied.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Permanent loss of the mailbox contents can occur if these steps aren't completed within 30 days from the time that the mailbox was disconnected. If you assign a license after the 30-day period, the mailbox won't be reconnected, and a new mailbox will be provisioned instead.

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Temporarily assign a license to reconnect the mailbox.

2. Update the on-premises remote mailbox to the `Shared` type by running the following cmdlet in the on-premises Exchange Management Shell (EMS):

   ```powershell
   Set-RemoteMailbox -Identity <mailbox ID> -Type Shared
   ```

3. Convert the regular mailbox to a shared mailbox in Exchange Online by running the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):

   ```powershell
   Set-Mailbox -Identity <mailbox ID> -Type Shared
   ```

4. Remove the temporary license.
