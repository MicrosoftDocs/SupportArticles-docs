# Users prompted for credentials after adding a shared mailbox as a second Exchange email account in their Outlook profile

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3184064

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a hybrid deployment of on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange Online in Microsoft 365.
- You configured legacy on-premises public folders for a hybrid deployment.
- You create a shared mailbox that's located in Exchange Online.
- You assign Full Access permissions to one or more users.
- Users add the shared mailbox as a second Exchange account in their existing Outlook profile.

In this scenario, users are repeatedly prompted for credentials when they open Outlook.

## Cause

This issue occurs because Outlook tries to connect to the legacy on-premises public folders for the shared mailbox.

## Workaround

To work around the problem, move the shared mailbox to the on-premises environment.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, you can enable access to public folders for users and disable access to public folders for the shared mailbox. To do this, [connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) and follow these steps:

1. Enable access to public folders for users by running the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Set-CASMailbox tony@contoso.com -PublicFolderClientAccess $true
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This example enables access to public folders for the user tony@contoso.com.

1. Disable access to public folders for the shared mailbox by running the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Set-CASMailbox adam@contoso.com -PublicFolderClientAccess $false
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > This example disables access to public folders for the shared mailbox adam@contoso.com.

1. Enable access to public folders for the organization by running the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Set-OrganizationConfig -PublicFolderShowClientControl $true
   ```

## More information

An error message that resembles the following is found in the RPC Client Access service log for this connection attempt:

> [LoginPermException] 'User SID: *SID*' can't act as owner of a MailUser
object '/o=ExchangeLabs/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (*Group*)/cn=Recipients/cn=<User_Identity>' with SID *SID* and MasterAccountSid S-1-5-10
 (StoreError=LoginPerm)
