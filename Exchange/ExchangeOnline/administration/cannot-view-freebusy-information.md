# On-premises users can't view free/busy information of Exchange Online users

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3137325

## Symptoms

Users who have a mailbox in the on-premises environment cannot view free/busy information for mailboxes in Exchange Online in the following scenario:

- You have a hybrid deployment of Exchange Online and either on-premises Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013.
- You've set up an intraorganization connector between the Exchange Online organization and the on-premises Exchange organization.
- You've set up an organization relationship between the Exchange Online organization and the on-premises Exchange organization.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the on-premises Exchange server cannot obtain an authentication token by using OAuth. Exchange doesn't try to use the organization relationship if an intraorganization connector exists.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps.

### Step 1 - Verify the OAuth certificate

1. Open the Exchange Management Shell.
2. Identify the certificate for which the authentication configuration is looking. To do this, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-AuthConfig |fl
    ```

3. If no value is returned in the output for CurrentCertificateThumbprint, create a new certificate. To do this, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    New-ExchangeCertificate -KeySize 2048 -SubjectName "cn= Microsoft Exchange ACS Certificate" -FriendlyName "Microsoft Exchange Server ACS Certificate" -PrivateKeyExportable $true -Services SMTP -DomainName <YourPrimarySmtpDomain>
    ```

4. Assign the new certificate for OAuth authentication. To do this, run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    Set-AuthConfig -NewCertificateThumbprint <ThumbprintFromStep3> -NewCertificateEffectiveDate (Get-Date)
    ```

    ```powershell
    Set-AuthConfig -PublishCertificate
    ```

### Step 2 - Specify the user account for the partner application

1. Open the Exchange Management Shell.
2. Identify the linked user account for the partner application. To do this, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-PartnerApplication |fl
    ```

3. If no account is returned in the output, add the appropriate user account. To do this, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Set-PartnerApplication "Exchange Online" -LinkedAccount "contoso.com/Users/Exchange Online-ApplicationAccount"
    ```
