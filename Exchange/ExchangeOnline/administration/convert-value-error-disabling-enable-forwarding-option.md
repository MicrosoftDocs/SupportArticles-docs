# Cannot convert value when you disable the Enable Forwarding option for a Microsoft 365 user

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2872435

## Problem

You try to disable the **Enable Forwarding** option for a Microsoft 365 user's mailbox to disable mail forwarding. To do this, you click to clear the **Enable Forwarding** check box in the Exchange Admin Center. However, the check box is not cleared, and you receive the following error message:

> Cannot convert value "to type "System.Boolean". Boolean parameters accept only Boolean values and numbers, such as $True, $False, 1 or 0.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, use Windows PowerShell to disable forwarding for the user's mailbox. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information about how to do this, go to [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
    Set-Mailbox -Identity <User ID> -DeliveryToMailboxAndForward $False -ForwardingAddress $Null
    ```
