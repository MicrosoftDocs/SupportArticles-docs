2. Select the circle in the upper-right corner of the page that shows your initials or an icon of a person.

## More information

In Microsoft 365, user photos are stored in the following locations:

- A low-resolution photo (less than 100 KB) is stored in the user's `ThumbnailPhoto` attribute in Active Directory. This is the photo that's synchronized to Microsoft 365 in a hybrid environment. Low-resolution photos are used by Lync 2010.
- A high-resolution photo is stored in the root directory of the user's Exchange Online mailbox. High-resolution photos are displayed in Exchange Online, Lync 2013, Skype for Business and Teams.
