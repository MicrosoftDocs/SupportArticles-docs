# Incorrect output when you run Get-CASMailbox to view HasActiveSyncDevicePartnership

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3001236

## Symptoms

In a Microsoft Exchange Online environment, you run the `Get-CASMailbox` cmdlet to view the `HasActiveSyncDevicePartnership` attribute. The output shows that the mailbox has no device partnership. However, the user has one or more devices that are synchronizing with their mailbox.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-CASMailbox <Alias> -RecalculateHasActiveSyncDevicePartnership
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `RecalculateHasActiveSyncDevicePartnership` parameter was introduced to the `Get-CASMailbox` cmdlet in build 15.00.0980.000 of Microsoft 365. To determine the build of Microsoft 365 that the mailbox is on, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-Mailbox <Mailbox> | fl AdminDisplayVersion
```

## More information

The `RecalculateHasActiveSyncDevicePartnership` parameter recalculates the value of the `HasActiveSyncDevicePartnership` attribute on the mailbox. The value is automatically updated if it's determined to be incorrect. You don't have to specify a value for the `HasActiveSyncDevicePartnership` attribute.

For more information, see [Get-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-casmailbox?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true).
