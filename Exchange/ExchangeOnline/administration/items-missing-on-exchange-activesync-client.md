# Email items are missing on an Exchange Server ActiveSync client
  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4058179

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync, some email messages are missing even though the client continues to receive messages.

## Cause

When the server that's running Exchange Server responds to a **Sync** command for one or more new items, the client either does not receive the response or cannot process the response. The ActiveSync client sends a **Ping** command for the affected folder before it sends another **Sync** command to retrieve the items that failed in the first response. Because the **Ping** command was sent, the server believes that the message was already added to the device.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, disable email synchronization on the Exchange ActiveSync client, and then re-enable email for the client.

## Status

This behavior is by design. The **Ping** command is an acknowledgment of the **Sync** response.
