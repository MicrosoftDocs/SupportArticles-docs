# ObjectClass Unknown is returned when you use the Get-MailboxStatistics cmdlet

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2795291

## Problem

When you use the `Get-MailboxStatistics` Windows PowerShell cmdlet to get information about a mailbox in on-premises Exchange Server or Exchange Online in Microsoft 365, the `ObjectClass` property unexpectedly returns a value of **Unknown**.

For example, when you run the `Get-MailboxStatistics admin | FL *object*` command, you receive the following output:

```output
ObjectClass : Unknown
ObjectState: Unchanged
```

In earlier versions of Exchange Server and in Exchange Online in Microsoft 365, the `ObjectClass` property returns the correct value. For example, this property returns **Mailbox** for user mailboxes and **Mailbox, Disabled** for equipment and room mailboxes.
