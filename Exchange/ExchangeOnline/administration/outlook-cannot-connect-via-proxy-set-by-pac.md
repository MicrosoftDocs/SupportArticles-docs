# Outlook can't connect through a proxy that's set up by using a file://-based PAC file

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2332495

## Symptoms

Assume that you have a proxy that's set up by using a file://-based PAC file. In this situation, you can't use Outlook Anywhere to connect through this proxy to an on-premises Exchange 2013 server, an on-premises Exchange 2010 server, or Exchange Online.

## Cause

WinHTTP does not support PAC URLs that use a file:// prefix. Therefore, when Outlook connects by using WinHTTP, it can't use the PAC file if the URL starts with file://. This behavior is by design.

## Workaround - Method 1

Set up an `http://-based` PAC file, select the Use automatic configuration script option in Internet Explorer, and then specify the URL of the PAC file in the **Address** box.

## Workaround - Method 2

Deploy Web Proxy Automatic Discovery (WPAD), and then select the **Automatically detect settings** option in Internet Explorer.

For more information, see [Automatic discovery for firewall and Web Proxy clients](/previous-versions/tn-archive/cc713344(v=technet.10)).

## More information
