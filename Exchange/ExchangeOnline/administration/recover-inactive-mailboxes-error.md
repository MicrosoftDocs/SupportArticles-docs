# "The mailbox has additional shards that need recovery" error when recovering an inactive mailbox

## Symptoms

When you try to [recover an inactive mailbox](/microsoft-365/compliance/recover-an-inactive-mailbox) in Exchange Online, you receive the following error message about multiple component shards:  

> The inactive mailbox '\<identity of the inactive mailbox>' cannot be recovered because the mailbox has additional shards that need recovery.
  
## Cause  

This issue occurs if the inactive mailboxes have `AuxPrimary` shards in addition to `Primary` shards.  

To see which inactive mailboxes are affected by multiple shards, you can check the mailbox location information by running the following cmdlet in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):  
  
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly | fl UserPrincipalName,MailboxLocations
```

In the following example output, the mailbox shard location type is shown as `AuxPrimary` and `Primary`. This means that the mailbox has `AuxPrimary` shards.

## Resolution  

To resolve this issue, [restore the inactive mailbox](/microsoft-365/compliance/restore-an-inactive-mailbox) instead of recovering it.
