# Mac users can't release messages from Exchange Online Protection quarantine

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2909418

## Problem  

When a user tries to release a message from the Exchange Online Protection quarantine when using the Safari browser on a Mac, the user is prompted for a certificate as follows:

> The website "na01-quarantine.dataservice.protection.outlook.com" requires a client certificate.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Locate the Keychain Access program on the Mac. To do this, open **Finder**, and then open the Applications folder. The Applications folder contains a folder that's named Utilities. The Keychain Access program is in the Utilities folder.
2. Open Keychain Access, and then locate all certificates in the Safari dialog box that show as **This client requires a certificate**.
3. Select the certificates that you located in step 2, and then delete them from Keychain Access.
4. Restart Safari.
