# Self-help diagnostics for issues in Exchange Online and Outlook

It's vital that administrators be able to diagnose and resolve issues quickly in Exchange Online and Outlook. To support this effort, the Exchange and Outlook support teams have released some new features in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Currently, we provide diagnostics through text analytics. It's important to note that while these diagnostics can't make automatic changes to your tenant without your consent, they do offer insights into known issues, and provide instructions to fix those issues quickly. We also want to make it easier for you to find our diagnostics within the current experience. Therefore, we have created a new set of queries to help administrators.

**Note:** This feature isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.

When IT admins run customer diagnostics in the Microsoft 365 admin center to resolve issues without logging support requests, Microsoft will make donations to global nonprofit organizations.
