# Self-help diagnostics for issues in Exchange Online and Outlook

It's vital that administrators be able to diagnose and resolve issues quickly in Exchange Online and Outlook. To support this effort, the Exchange and Outlook support teams have released some new features in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

Currently, we provide diagnostics through text analytics. It's important to note that while these diagnostics can't make automatic changes to your tenant without your consent, they do offer insights into known issues, and provide instructions to fix those issues quickly. We also want to make it easier for you to find our diagnostics within the current experience. Therefore, we have created a new set of queries to help administrators.

**Note:** This feature isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.

## How do I run these diagnostics?

**Note:** You must be a Microsoft 365 administrator to run diagnostics.

1. Go to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home).
1. In the left pane, select **Show all** > **Support** > **New service request**.
1. In the **How can we help?** text box on the right side of the screen, you can briefly describe your issue (for example, "I want to increase the mailbox size"). Then, the system determines whether a diagnostic scenario matches your issue.

    **Note:** To access a specific diagnostic, you can also enter the corresponding shortcut command from the following [table](#what-scenarios-are-currently-covered) into the **How can we help?** text box.

    When you type search terms, a type-ahead query assists you to find the topics that you're searching for. See the following examples for Exchange Online and Outlook support issues.
