# Can't manage Send on Behalf permissions for shared mailboxes in the EAC

## Symptoms

When you sign in to the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) in Microsoft Exchange Online, you see limited options to set the permissions of a shared mailbox. The option to individually manage the **Send on Behalf** permissions is available for user mailboxes. However, only the option to manage full mailbox permissions is available for shared mailboxes.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the **Send on Behalf** permission can't be managed in the EAC.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, add the **Send on Behalf** permission by using Windows Remote PowerShell. To do this, follow the instructions on the following Microsoft TechNet website:

[Manage permissions for recipients in Exchange Online](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-permissions-for-recipients)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Microsoft 365, you can use Microsoft 365 Admin Portal to assign the **Send on Behalf** permission to shared mailboxes.

## More Information

For more information about shared mailboxes, see [Shared Mailboxes](/exchange/shared-mailboxes-exchange-2013-help).
