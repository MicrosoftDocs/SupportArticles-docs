# The length of the property is too long error when creating a new mail contact in EAC

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3002659

## Symptoms

When you create a mail contact by using the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

> Error  
The length of the property is too long. The maximum length is 64 and the length of the value provided is 67.

## Cause

This problem occurs if an existing contact (the `DisplayName` parameter) or an existing external contact (the `ExternalEmailAddress` parameter) has the same name that you try to use for the new mail contact.

## Resolution

Give the new contact a name that doesn't conflict with an existing mail contact or an existing external contact.

## More information

The error message that's described in the Symptoms section is not the correct error message for the scenario. This is a known issue in Microsoft 365. You receive the correct error message if you try to create a duplicate contact by using Exchange Online PowerShell.
