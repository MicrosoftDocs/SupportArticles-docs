# How to troubleshoot Windows PowerShell issues that affect Exchange Online for Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2570535

## Summary

This article describes how to troubleshoot Windows PowerShell issues that affect Microsoft Exchange Online for Microsoft 365.

## Resolution

Windows PowerShell is a command-line interface that's used to run administrative commands on Windows operating systems and server products. Windows PowerShell 2.0 includes Remote Windows PowerShell functionality.

Remote Windows PowerShell lets users run Windows PowerShell cmdlets on other computers or web services. This functionality relies on the Windows Remote Management service to connect to web services and to download the available cmdlets, based on the user who is currently logged in. Microsoft 365 lets admins connect to Exchange Online by using Exchange Online remote PowerShell.

To connect to Exchange Online, you must have the following tools:

- Windows PowerShell 2.0
- Windows Remote Management 2.0 (also known as WinRM)
- Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) 4.0

The Windows Management Framework installs all these tools.
