# (WinRM client cannot process the request) error when you connect to Exchange Online through remote Windows PowerShell

## Problem

When you use remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Exchange Online in Microsoft 365, you receive the following error message:

> [outlook.office365.com] Connecting to remote server failed with the following error message:  
> The WinRM client cannot process the request because the server name cannot be resolved. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.
>

## Cause

This issue occurs in one of the following situations:

- A firewall blocks necessary traffic.
- The Windows Remote Management service isn't started.
- The proxy server doesn't work correctly.

## Resolution

- Make sure that the firewall doesn't block necessary traffic.
- Check whether the Windows Remote Management service is installed and has started:

   1. Type *services.msc* in the **Run** dialog box, and then press Enter.
   1. In the Services MMC, double-click **Windows Remote Management**.
   1. Set the startup type to **Manual**, and then click **OK**.
   1. Right-click the service, and then select **Start**.
   1. Let the service start.

      > [!NOTE]
      > If the service was already started but it's not responding, you may have to click **Restart**.
   1. Try to connect to Exchange Online again.
- Check the proxy server setting

   1. Open an elevated Command Prompt.
   1. Run the following command to verify the current proxy configuration:

      ```console
      netsh winhttp show proxy
      ```

   1. Take one of the following actions:

      - To reset the WinHTTP proxy, run the following command:

        ```console
        netsh winhttp reset proxy
        ```

      - To configure a new proxy server, run the following command:

        ```console
        netsh winhttp set proxy <proxy>:<port>
        ```

        For example, run `netsh winhttp set proxy 10.0.0.6:8080`.
