# Format of the Exchange object version is wrong when you connect to Exchange Online in EMC

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3143722

## Problem

When you try to connect to Exchange Online through the Exchange Management Console (EMC) in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, you receive the following error message:

> The following error occurred while attempting to connect to the specified Exchange server 'PS.Outlook.com'
>
> The format of the Exchange object version is wrong  
> Parameter name: ExchangeBuild

This problem causes the following conditions to occur:

- You can't run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard that's included in the EMC.
- You can't view the properties of recipients in Exchange Online from the EMC. (You can still manage recipients in the EMC, but you can't view the properties of the recipients.)

## Workaround

To work around this problem, do one or both of the following, as appropriate for your situation:

- Run the [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration Wizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard).
- To view the recipient properties for mailboxes in an environment that has directory synchronization enabled, use the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online or use Exchange Online PowerShell.

## More information

For more information about using the Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard in Exchange 2010, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).
