# Error "You don't have permissions to update the options you specified" when Microsoft 365 kiosk users create inbox rules

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3187154

## Symptoms

When a Microsoft 365 kiosk user tries to create an inbox rule in Outlook on the web, the user receives the following error message:

> You don't have permissions to update the options you specified.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. Inbox rules aren't available in Microsoft 365 kiosk plans.

## Workaround

Do one of the following:

- Assign the user a license that allows creation of inbox rules. For more information, see [Exchange Online Service Description](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-service-description).
- Have an administrator create a transport rule for the user. For more information, see [Procedures for mail flow rules in Exchange Server](/Exchange/policy-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/mail-flow-rule-procedures).
