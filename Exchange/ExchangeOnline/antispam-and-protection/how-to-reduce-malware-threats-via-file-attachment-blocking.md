# How to reduce malware threats through file attachment blocking in Exchange Online Protection

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2959596

## Summary

Most malware that enters an environment through email does so through an executable payload that's attached to an email message.

To reduce your risk from malware that may not be detected by Exchange Online Protection, you should enable file type blocking and file name extension blocking. This article describes how to do this.

## Resolution

To create a rule to block attachments that contain executable content in Exchange Online Protection, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Exchange admin center.
2. Select **mail flow**, select **rules**, select **New** (![the plus button](./media/how-to-reduce-malware-threats-via-file-attachment-blocking/plus-button.jpg)), and then select **Create a new rule**.
3. In the **Name** box, specify a name for the rule, and then select **More options**.
4. Under **Apply this rule if**, point to **Any attachment**, and then select **has executable content** near the bottom of the page.
5. Under **Do the following**, point to **Block the message**, and then select the action that you want.
6. Select **save**.

The following is a screenshot of a sample rule.

The system automatically detects file types by inspecting file properties rather than the actual file name extension, thus helping to prevent malicious hackers from being able to bypass mail flow rule filtering by renaming a file extension.

Microsoft is continually updating its virus definition catalog based on [submissions](https://www.microsoft.com/wdsi/filesubmission). However, to provide customers with the most immediate and effective defense, a file filter block policy is critical.
