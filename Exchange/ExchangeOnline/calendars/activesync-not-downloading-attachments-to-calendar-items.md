# Exchange ActiveSync doesn't download attachments to Calendar items on mobile devices

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2503175

## Symptoms

Attachments on meetings or appointments are not available when you synchronize the Calendar with a Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync client.

## Cause

This problem occurs if one or both of the following conditions are true:

- The Exchange ActiveSync client doesn't support version 16 or a later version of the Exchange ActiveSync protocol.
- The mailbox is located on a version of Exchange that doesn't support version 16 or a later version of the Exchange ActiveSync protocol.

## Resolution

To synchronize attachments in a calendar item, follow these steps:

1. Move the mailbox to Exchange Online or to Exchange 2016.
2. Upgrade the device to a client that supports version 16 or later.
