# Room Finder in Outlook doesn't display any conference rooms when a user creates a meeting

## Problem 

When a user creates a new meeting in Microsoft Outlook, no conference rooms are listed in the **Choose an available room** box in the Room Finder. 

This issue may occur if the user doesn't select a room list. A room list must be selected before available rooms are displayed in the Room Finder. 

## Solution 

To display available rooms, select a room list from the **Show a room list** box.

## More information 

To create a room list and to add existing rooms to the room list, follow these steps: 
 
1. Do one of the following:  
   - In on-premises Exchange Server or in an Exchange hybrid environment, open the Exchange Management Shell.    
   - In Exchange Online, connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx).    
     
2. Run the following command to create a room list:   

    ```powershell
    New-DistributionGroup <RoomListName> -RoomList -Members $Members
    ```
1. Run the following command to add existing rooms to the room list:

    ```powershell
    Add-DistributionGroupMember <RoomListName> -Member <RoomMailbox>
    ```
 
For more information, see [Create a room list distribution group](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ee633471%28v=exchg.141%29.aspx) and [Create and manage room mailboxes](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj215781%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx).
