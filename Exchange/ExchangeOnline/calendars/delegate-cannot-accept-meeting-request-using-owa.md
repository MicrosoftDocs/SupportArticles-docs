# Delegate can't accept meeting request in OWA when manager is in another forest during coexistence

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4089867

## Symptoms

As a delegate, you can't open a meeting request in Outlook Web Access (OWA) that was forwarded by your manager who is in a different forest. You can't accept or decline the meeting request, and you receive the following message in the preview pane:

> Your request can't be completed right now. Please try again later.

## Cause

This issue occurs because delegates and managers may not be moved to the cloud at the same time. OWA doesn't support the ability to accept and decline meeting requests.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use the Outlook for Windows client to accept or decline the meeting request.
