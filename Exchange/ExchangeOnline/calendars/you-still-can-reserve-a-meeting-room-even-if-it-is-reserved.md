# Microsoft 365 users can reserve a meeting room even though it's already reserved for another meeting

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3066068

## Symptoms

When a Microsoft 365 user tries to schedule a meeting in a room that's already reserved for another meeting, the Calendar Attendant doesn't automatically decline the conflicting meeting request.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the `AllRequestOutOfPolicy` property of the room mailbox is set to True. This causes the room mailbox to ignore conflicting meeting requests.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, set the `AllRequestOutOfPolicy` property of the room mailbox to **False**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-CalendarProcessing -Identity "Meeting Room" | Set-CalendarProcessing -AllRequestOutOfPolicy $False
    ```
