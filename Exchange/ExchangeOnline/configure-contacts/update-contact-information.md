For organizations that use directory synchronization, use on-premises tools to update contact information.

### How to update contact information

1. Sign in to Outlook Web App.   
2. Click **Settings **, and then click **Options**. 
3. In the left navigation pane, click **Account**, and then click **Edit Information**.   
4. Make the changes that you want, and then click **Save**.   

> [!NOTE]
> The offline address book (OAB) will not be updated for at least 24 hours.

### How administrators can update users' contact information

1. Sign in to the Office 365 portal ([https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) as an administrator.   
2. Click **Admin**, and then click **Exchange**.   
3. In the left navigation pane, click **Recipients**, and then click **Mailboxes**.   
4. Double-click the user whose contact information you want to change.

5. Click **Edit** (![A screen shot of the Edit icon ](https://support.microsoft.com/Library/Images/2797930.png)).
