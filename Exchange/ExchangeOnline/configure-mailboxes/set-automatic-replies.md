## More Information

### Method 1

1. Locate **Users** > **Active users** (or **Groups** > **Shared mailboxes** if you set this on a shared mailbox).
1. Select a user who has a Microsoft Exchange mailbox. 
1. On the flyout menu on the right, locate **Mail settings** > **Automatic replies** (if it's a shared mailbox, just locate **Automatic replies** on the flyout).

### Method 2

1. Sign in to the Office 365 admin portal by using administrator credentials.
1. Expand **Admin Centers**, and then select **Exchange**.
1. Click the picture in the upper-right corner, select **Another User**, and then select the user mailbox that you want to change.
1. On the left side, select **Options**, click **Organize E-mail**, and then click **Automatic replies**.

### Method 3

```powershell
