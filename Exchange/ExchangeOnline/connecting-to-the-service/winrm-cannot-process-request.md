# "WinRM client cannot process the request" error when you connect to Exchange Online through remote Windows PowerShell

## Problem 

When you try to use remote Windows PowerShell to connect to Microsoft Exchange Online in Microsoft Office 365, you receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
[outlook.office365.com] Connecting to remote server failed with the following error message:
The "WinRM client cannot process the request because the server name cannot be resolved. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.

+ CategoryInfo : OpenError:
(System.Manageme....RemoteRunspace:RemoteRunspace) [].
PSRemotingTransportException

+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PSSessionOpenedFailed
```

## Cause 

This issue occurs if either an internal firewall or the Windows Remote Management service has not been started.

## Solution 

To resolve this issue, check whether the Windows Remote Management service is installed and has started. To do this, follow these steps: 

1. Do one of the following: 
   - In Windows 8, press the Windows logo key+R to open the **Run** dialog box, type services.msc, and then press Enter.   
   - In Windows 7 or Windows Vista, click **Start**, type services.mscin the **Start search **field, and then press Enter.    
   - In Windows XP, click **Start**, click **Run**, type services.msc, and then press Enter.   
2. In the Services window, double-click **Windows Remote Management**.    
3. Set the startup type to **Manual**, and then click **OK**.    
4. Right-click the service, and then click **Start**.    
5. Let the service start. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the service was already started but it's not responding, you may have to click **Restart**.    
6. Try to connect to Exchange Online again.
