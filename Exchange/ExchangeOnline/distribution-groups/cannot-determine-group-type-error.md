# "Cannot determine group type" error when checking group in Office 365 admin center

## Symptoms

A distribution group is converted to a room list by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-DistributionGroup <group name> -RoomList
```

When you examine the distribution group in the Office 365 admin center, you see the following error message:

`"Cannot determine group type"`

## Resolution

Create room lists by using the following cmdlet instead:

```powershell
New-DistributionGroup <group name> -RoomList
```

For more information, see [New-DistributionGroup](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchange/users-and-groups/new-distributiongroup?view=exchange-ps).

> [!NOTE]
> Room list distribution groups are not visible in the Office 365 admin center or the Exchange admin center. The groups can be managed only through PowerShell.
