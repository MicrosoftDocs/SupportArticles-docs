# Troubleshoot: Remove an alias from a contact

Did you get this error when you were creating a new user? "This email address is already being used as an alias for the contact \<contact name>." This article will show you how to remove the email alias from the contact.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> It is unusual for a contact to have an alias because it has to be added using Exchange Online PowerShell. You'll have to remove it using Exchange Online PowerShell.
>
> If you're new to PowerShell, you can do this! The Exchange Online PowerShell commands used in this article will only remove an alias from a contact.
  
## Remove the email alias from the contact using Exchange Online PowerShell

Before you can do this procedure, you need the following:
  
- [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell)

- The display name of the contact

- The email address that you want to remove

1. In Exchange Online PowerShell, replace the contact name and email address with your values, and run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-MailContact -Identity "Contact name" -Alias @{remove="alias@contoso.com"}
   ```

2. It may take a few minutes, but when the command has completed, the command prompt will return. You'll only get a message if there was an error.

3. Close the connection to Exchange Online PowerShell by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-PSSession $Session
   ```
