# Troubleshoot: Remove an alias from a mail-enabled security group

Did you get this error when you were creating a new user? "This email address is already being used as an alias for the mail-enabled security group \<group name>." This article will show you how to remove the email alias from the mail-enabled security group.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> It is unusual for a mail-enabled security group to have an alias because it has to be added using Exchange Online PowerShell. You'll have to remove it using Exchange Online PowerShell. <br><br> If you're new to PowerShell, you can do this! The Exchange Online PowerShell commands used in this article will only remove an alias from an mail-enabled security group. 
  
## Remove the email alias from the group using Exchange Online PowerShell

Before you can do this procedure, you need the following:
  
- [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=396554)   
- The name of the group 
- The email address that you want to remove
    
1. In Exchange Online PowerShell, replace the group name and the email address with your values, and run the following command: 
    
   ```
   Set-DistributionGroup -Identity "Group name" -Alias @{remove="alias@contoso.com"}
   ```

2. It may take a few minutes, but when the command has completed, the command prompt will return. You'll only get a message if there was an error.
    
3. Close the connection to Exchange Online PowerShell by running the following command:
     
   ```
   Remove-PSSession $Session
   ```
