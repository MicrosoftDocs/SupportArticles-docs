# Troubleshoot: Remove an alias from a shared mailbox

Did you get this error when you were creating a new user? "This email address is already being used as an alias for the shared mailbox \<mailbox name>." This article will show you how to remove the email address from the shared mailbox so you can re-use it. 
  
> [!TIP]
> Email addresses are how the internet knows where to send your email and all email addresses must be unique - across the entire internet no two email addresses can be the same. 
  
## Remove the email alias from the shared mailbox

Before you begin, make sure you've noted which shared mailbox you need to remove the email address from.
  
1. From the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>, you can find the shared mailbox a couple of different ways:
    
  - From the admin center **Home** page, type the name of the shared mailbox into the **search** field, and then select it from the list. It will open the shared mailbox's details card. 
    
  - Go to **Groups** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847" target="_blank">Shared mailboxes</a>, and then select the shared mailbox from the list. 
    
2. In the **Name**, **Email**, and **Email aliases** section, select **Edit**.
    
3. In the **Email aliases** section, remove the email address by selecting the remove (wastebin) icon, and then **Save**.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't remove the primary email address. If you need to remove the primary email address, add a second email address for this shared mailbox and select **Set as primary**. Then you can remove the email alias.
