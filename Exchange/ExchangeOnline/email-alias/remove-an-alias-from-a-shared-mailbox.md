# Troubleshoot: Remove an alias from a shared mailbox

Did you get this error when you were creating a new user? "This email address is already being used as an alias for the shared mailbox \<mailbox name>." This article will show you how to remove the email address from the shared mailbox so you can re-use it.
  
> [!TIP]
> Email addresses are how the internet knows where to send your email and all email addresses must be unique - across the entire internet no two email addresses can be the same.
  
## Remove the email alias from the shared mailbox

Before you begin, make sure you've noted which shared mailbox you need to remove the email address from.
  
1. From the [admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339), you can find the shared mailbox a couple of different ways:

   - From the admin center **Home** page, type the name of the shared mailbox into the **search** field, and then select it from the list. It will open the shared mailbox's details card.

   - Go to **Groups** > [Shared mailboxes](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2066847), and then select the shared mailbox from the list.

2. In the **Name**, **Email**, and **Email aliases** section, select **Edit**.

3. In the **Email aliases** section, remove the email address by selecting the remove (wastebin) icon, and then **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can't remove the primary email address. If you need to remove the primary email address, add a second email address for this shared mailbox and select **Set as primary**. Then you can remove the email alias.
