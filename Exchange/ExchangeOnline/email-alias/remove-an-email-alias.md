# Troubleshoot: Remove an email alias from a user

Did you get this error when you were creating a new user? "This email address is already being used as an alias for user \<user name>." This article will show you how to remove the email alias from the user.
  
> [!TIP]
> Email addresses are how the internet knows where to send your email and all email addresses must be unique - across the entire internet no two email addresses can be the same. 
  
## Remove the email address from the user

Before you begin, make sure you've noted which user you need to remove the email address from.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're not using the new Microsoft 365 admin center, you can turn it on by selecting the **Try the new admin center** toggle located at the top of the Home page.

1. There are two ways you can find a user's account information: 
    
  - In the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin center</a>, type the user's name into the **search** field at the top of the page, and then select them from the list. It will open the user card. 
    
  - Or, in the admin center, go to the **Users** \> <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=834822" target="_blank">Active users</a> page and select the user from the list. 
    
2. Select **Manage email aliases**.  
    
3. Select the alias you want to remove and select the remove (wastebin) icon, and then **Save changes**.
