# Delivery receipts aren't generated when users send mail to external recipients

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3184617

## Symptoms

When users request a delivery receipt for a message that they send to external recipients, they receive the following message:

> Delivery to these recipients or groups is complete, but no delivery notification was sent by the destination server.

## Cause

This behavior occurs if the recipient organization doesn't allow delivery reports.

## More information

The recipient organization can choose not to allow any delivery receipts. This prevents external senders from receiving delivery receipts. To configure this option, run the `Set-RemoteDomain` cmdlet, and then set the `DeliveryReportEnabled` parameter for the remote domain to **False**.

For more information, see [Set-RemoteDomain](/powershell/module/exchange/set-remotedomain).
