# Inbox rule to redirect messages doesn't work if forwarding is set up on a mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3069075

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You use the `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet together with the `DeliverToMailboxAndForward $True` parameter to specify that email messages that are sent to a particular user are delivered both to that user's mailbox and to another address.

    For example, you run the following command so that messages that are addressed to Sally are delivered to Sally's mailbox and are also forwarded to Manuel's mailbox.

    ```powershell
    Set-Mailbox sally@contoso.com -ForwardingSmtpAddress manuel@contoso.com -DeliverToMailboxAndForward $True
    ```

- The user creates an inbox rule in Microsoft Outlook to redirect messages that they receive. For example, Sally creates a rule in Outlook to redirect messages to another address.

In this scenario, when a message is sent to the first user, the message is delivered to that user and to the forwarding address. However, the message is not delivered to the redirecting address.

## Cause

This is expected behavior. Forwarding on a mailbox overrides an inbox redirection rule. To enable the redirection rule, remove forwarding on the mailbox.
