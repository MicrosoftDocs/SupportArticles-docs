# "550 x-dg-ref header is too long" when sending mail in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4467875

## Symptoms

When you send mail from Outlook in Exchange Online, you receive a non-delivery report (NDR) that resembles the following:

> 550 5.0.350 Remote server returned an error -> 550 x-dg-ref header is too long.

## Cause

This issue occurs if you use **Rich Text** formatting in Outlook and the message has at least one attachment. The attachment may also be nested so that it contains another attached message.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue so that the message can be delivered successfully, select the **HTML** option instead of **Rich Text Format** when you compose email messages.

The **HTML** option prevents the attachment from being part of the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) header.
