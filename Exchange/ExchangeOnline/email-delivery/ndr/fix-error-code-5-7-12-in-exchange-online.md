# Fix NDR error "550 5.7.12" in Exchange Online

It's frustrating when you get an error after sending an email message. This topic describes what you can do if you see status code 550 5.7.12 or 5.7.12 in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR, bounce message, delivery status notification, or DSN). You'll see this automated notification when the recipient is configured to reject messages that are sent from outside of its organization.

### Method 2: Use the recipient's allowed senders list

Instead of allowing all external senders to send messages to this recipient, you can use the recipient's allowed senders list to selectively allow messages from all internal senders and the specified external senders.

**Notes**:

- To add an external sender to a recipient's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts) or a [mail user](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users) to represent the external sender in your organization.

- To add everyone in your organization to a recipient's allowed sender's list, you can create a [distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups) or a [dynamic distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups) that contains everyone in your organization. After you create this group, you can add it to the recipient's allowed senders list.

- The recipient's allowed senders list is different from the organization's allowed senders list for anti-spam that you manage in the EAC at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**.

To configure the recipient's allowed senders list, open the EAC and use one of the following procedures based on the recipient type.

#### User mailboxes

##### New EAC

1. Go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The mailbox properties screen appears.

3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** screen appears.

4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** screen appears.

5. Configure the following settings under the **Accept messages from** section:
   - Clear the check box for **Require senders to be authenticated**.
   - Choose the radio button for **Selected senders**.
   - Click **+ Add sender**.
