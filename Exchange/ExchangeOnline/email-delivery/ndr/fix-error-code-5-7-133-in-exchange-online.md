# Fix NDR error "550 5.7.133" in Exchange Online

It's frustrating when you get an error after sending an email message. This topic describes what you can do if you see error code 550 5.7.133 in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR, bounce message, delivery status notification, or DSN). You'll see this automated notification when the recipient is a group that's configured to reject messages from external senders, that is, senders from outside the organization.

The two methods that will allow an external sender to send messages to the distribution group in your organization are described in the following sections.

To open the Exchange admin center (EAC), see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](/exchange/exchange-admin-center).

### Method 1: Allow all internal and external senders to send messages to this group

#### New Exchange admin center (EAC)

1. Go to **Recipients** \> **Groups**.

2. Select a group from the list and click it. The group properties screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/group-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen group.":::

3. Click the **Settings** tab.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/group-screen.png" alt-text="The screen on which group details are displayed.":::

4. Under **Delivery management**, click **Edit delivery management**. The **Delivery management** screen appears.
 
5. Under **Sender options**, choose **Allow messages from people inside and outside my organization**.

6. Click **Save changes**.

#### Classic EAC

1. In the EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Groups** \> select the group from the list, and then click **Edit** :::image type="icon" source="media/edit-icon.png":::.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/groups.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the group lists.":::

2. In the group properties dialog box that opens, go to **Delivery management** \> select **Senders inside and outside of my organization**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/no-restriction-on-any-sender.png" alt-text="The Delivery Management screen to configure all senders to send mails.":::

3. Click **Save**.

### Method 2: Use the group's allowed senders list

Instead of allowing all external senders to send messages to this group, you can use the group's allowed senders list to selectively allow messages from all internal senders and the specified external senders.

**Notes**:

- To add an external sender to a group's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts) or a [mail user](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users) to represent the external sender in your organization.

- To add everyone in your organization to a group's allowed sender's list, you can create a [distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups) or a [dynamic distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups) that contains everyone in your organization. After you create this group, you can add it to the group's allowed senders list.

- The group's allowed senders list is different from the organization's allowed senders list for anti-spam that you manage in the EAC at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**.

To configure the group's allowed senders list, perform the following steps:

#### New EAC

1. Go to **Recipients** \> **Groups**.

2. Select a group from the list and click it. The group properties screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/group-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen group.":::

3. Click the **Settings** tab.

4. Under **Delivery management**, click **Edit delivery management**. The **Delivery management** screen appears.

5. Under **Sender options**, choose **Allow messages from people inside and outside my organization**.

6. Under **Specified senders**, click inside the text box. The list of senders (internal and external) is displayed.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-133-in-exchange-online/list-of-senders.png" alt-text="The screen that lists the internal and external senders who can be added to the senders list.":::

7. Choose the senders you want to add to the senders list, and click **Save changes**.
