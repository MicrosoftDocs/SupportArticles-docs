The two methods that will allow an external sender to send messages to the mailbox in your organization are described in the following sections.

To open the New Exchange admin center (EAC), see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](/exchange/exchange-admin-center).

To open the Classic EAC, click **Classic Exchange admin center** on the left pane of the **Exchange admin center** (New) home screen, as shown in the image below.

### Method 1: Allow all internal and external senders to send messages to this mailbox

#### New EAC

1. Go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The user mailbox properties screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/user-mailboxes-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen user mailbox.":::

3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-flow-settings-screen.png" alt-text="The Manage mail flow settings screen.":::

4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** screen appears.

#### Classic EAC

1. In the Classic EAC, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes** > select the mailbox from the list, and then click **Edit** :::image type="icon" source="media/edit-icon.png":::.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/mailbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the mailbox tab in which you can find mailboxes in Exchange admin center.":::

2. In the mailbox properties dialog box that opens, go to **Mailbox features** \> **Message Delivery Restrictions** \> and then click **View details**.

4. Click **OK**, and then click **Save**.

### Method 2: Use the mailbox's allowed senders list

Instead of allowing all external senders to send messages to this mailbox, you can use the mailbox's allowed senders list to selectively allow messages from all internal senders and the specified external senders.

**Notes**:

- To add an external sender to a mailbox's allowed senders list, you must first create a [mail contact](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-contacts) or a [mail user](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-users) to represent the external sender in your organization.
- To add everyone in your organization to a mailbox's allowed sender's list, you can create a [distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups) or a [dynamic distribution group](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups/manage-dynamic-distribution-groups) that contains everyone in your organization. After you create this group, you can add it to the mailbox's allowed senders list.
- The mailbox's allowed senders list is different from the organization's allowed senders list for anti-spam that you manage in the EAC at **Protection** \> **Spam filter**.

To configure the mailbox's allowed senders list, do the following steps:

#### New EAC

1. Go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.

2. Select a user mailbox from the list and click it. The user mailbox properties screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/user-mailboxes-properties.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the properties of the chosen user mailbox.":::

3. Under **Mail flow settings**, click **Manage mail flow settings**. The **Manage mail flow settings** screen appears.

   :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/manage-mail-flow-settings-screen.png" alt-text="The Manage Mail Flow Settings screen.":::

4. In the **Message delivery restriction** pane, click **Edit**. The **Message delivery restrictions** screen appears.

5. Under **Accept messages from**:

   - Clear the check box for **Require senders to be authenticated**.

   - Select **Selected senders**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/fix-error-code-5-7-134-in-exchange-online/accept-messages-from-screen.png" alt-text="The screen displaying the Accept Messages From pane.":::
