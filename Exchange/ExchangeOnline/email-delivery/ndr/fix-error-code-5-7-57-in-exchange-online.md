# Fix NDR error "550 5.7.57" in Exchange Online

## Why did I get this bounce message?

When you connect to the smtp.office365.com endpoint to submit (relay) messages through Microsoft 365 or Office 365, you need to authenticate with the credentials of a user who has an Exchange Online mailbox. This bounce message indicates a problem in the configuration of the connecting application or device.

## I got this bounce message. How do I fix it?

- In the configuration of the connecting application or device, verify that the specified credentials are correct.

- Verify that the application or device is able to negotiate TLS, as TLS is required in order to authenticate. For more information, see [How to set up a multifunction device or application to send email](/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/how-to-set-up-a-multifunction-device-or-application-to-send-email-using-microsoft-365-or-office-365).

## I'm an email admin. How do I fix this?

The distinction between an end user and an admin is blurred for this bounce message, as the problem lies within the configuration of the application or device.
