# "554 5.2.0 STOREDRV.Deliver.Exception" when sending emails in Exchange Online

## Problem

When users send messages to a specific mailbox in Exchange Online, they receive a nondelivery report that contains the following error code:

> 554 5.2.0 STOREDRV.Deliver.Exception:ObjectNotFoundException.MapiExceptionNotFound; Failed to process message due to a permanent exception with message Cannot get ID from name

For example, users may experience this issue when they send mail to a distribution group.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the Clutter feature is enabled for the user but the Clutter folder is missing in the user's mailbox.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, turn off Clutter for the user. To do this, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Use Outlook on the web

1. In Outlook on the web, click **Settings** in the upper-right corner.
2. Click **My app settings**, click **Mail**, and then click **Clutter**.
3. Clear the **Separate items identified as clutter** check box, and then click **Save**.

For more information about how to turn Clutter on or off, see [Use Clutter to sort low priority messages in Outlook 2016 for Windows](https://support.office.com/article/use-clutter-to-sort-low-priority-messages-in-outlook-2016-for-windows-7b50c5db-7704-4e55-8a1b-dfc7bf1eafa0).

### Method 2: Use Exchange Online PowerShell

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using PowerShell. For more information, see [Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Get-Mailbox user@contoso.com | Set-Clutter -Enable $false
    ```

For more information about how to use the `Set-Clutter` cmdlet to turn Clutter on or off, see [Set-Clutter](/powershell/module/exchange/set-clutter).
