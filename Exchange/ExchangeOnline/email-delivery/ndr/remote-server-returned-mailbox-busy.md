# "554 4.3.2 mailbox busy" when sending emails to a mailbox in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4024024

## Symptoms

When you send email messages to a mailbox in Microsoft Exchange Online, the messages aren't delivered, and you receive the following error message:

> Remote Server returned '554 4.3.2 mailbox busy; STOREDRV.Deliver.Exception:StoragePermanentException.MapiExceptionMaxObjsExceeded; Failed to process message due to a permanent exception with message Cannot complete delivery-time processing.

## Cause

This problem may occur if the mailbox has reached the limit of items in a folder. In Exchange Online, the limit is one million.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, move emails from the folder that contains one million items to another folder or to an archive.

## More information

To find the number of items within each folder in a mailbox, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity <UPN> | FT Name, FolderPath, ItemsInFolder -AutoSize
```
