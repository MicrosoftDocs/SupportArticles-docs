# 5.7.1 Unable to Relay: Blocked by Customer Allow List

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3013740

## Problem

An external email server can't connect to Microsoft Exchange Online Protection because its IP address was added to a blocklist. When a sender tries to send mail through that server, the sender receives a non-delivery report (NDR) that contains the following error message. (The message doesn't include the name of the specific blocklist.)

> 5.7.1. Unable To Relay: Blocked by Customer Allow list

## Cause

This issue occurs if the IP address is added to both the incoming connector and the **IP Allow list** on the Connection Filtering page of the Exchange admin center. In this scenario, the NDR doesn't include the name of the specific blocklist if the IP address is added to a real-time blocklist (RBL) that's used in Exchange Online Protection.

## Solution

To determine the name of the specific blocklist that's preventing the IP address from connecting to Exchange Online Protection, remove the IP address of the external email server from the **IP Allow list**. After you do it, the NDR will include the name of the specific blocklist.

## More information

Ideally, only on-premises IP addresses should be added to connector settings.
