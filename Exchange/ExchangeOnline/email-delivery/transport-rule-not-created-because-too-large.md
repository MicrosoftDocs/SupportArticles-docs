# The rule can't be created because it is too large when you create or change a transport rule

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3003043

## Problem

When you try to create or change a transport rule in Exchange Online or in Exchange Online Protection, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

> The rule cannot be created because it is too large. It has \<X> characters and the maximum number of characters is 8192. Reduce the size.

## Cause

This problem occurs if the size of the transport rule is more than 8 kilobytes (KB).

The maximum size of a single transport rule is 8 KB. The character limit for all regular expressions that are used in all transport rules is 20 KB. This limit applies to the total number of characters that are used by all regular expressions, including keywords.

## Solution

Reduce the number of conditions or actions in the rule so that the rule's size is no more than 8 KB. Or, create multiple rules so that several smaller rules work together to perform the function of one large rule.
