# (Cannot determine group type) error when checking group in Microsoft 365 admin center

## Symptoms

A distribution group is converted to a room list by running the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-DistributionGroup <group name> -RoomList
```

When you examine the distribution group in the Microsoft 365 admin center, you see the following error message:

> Cannot determine group type

## Resolution

Create room lists by using the following cmdlet instead:

```powershell
New-DistributionGroup <group name> -RoomList
```

For more information, see [New-DistributionGroup](/powershell/module/exchange/new-distributiongroup).

> [!NOTE]
> Room list distribution groups are not visible in the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Exchange admin center. The groups can be managed only through PowerShell.
