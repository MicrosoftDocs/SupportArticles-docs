# Can't use the Exchange admin center to remove members from a distribution group that has more than 3,000 members

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3031293

## Problem

When you view a distribution group in the Exchange admin center, not all members are listed if that distribution group contains a large number of members. The Exchange admin center can display up to 3,000 members per distribution group.

If a distribution group contains more than 3,000 members, you can't use the Exchange admin center to remove members who aren't listed.

## Workaround

Use the `Remove-DistributionGroupMember` cmdlet instead of the Exchange admin center to remove members from a distribution group.

For example, to remove *roger@contoso.com* from a distribution group that's named Customer Service, follow these steps:

1. Do one of the following:

   - Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information about how to do this, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
   - Open the Exchange Management Shell on an Exchange server in your on-premises environment.

2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Remove-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Customer Service" -Member roger@contoso.com
    ```

## More information

For more information about this cmdlet, see [Remove-DistributionGroupMember](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-distributiongroupmember).
