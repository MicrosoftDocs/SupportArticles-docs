# Can't use Reply All in email messages with Microsoft 365 groups

Consider the following example. You're a member of a Microsoft 365 group. You receive an email message addressed to the group, to which you'd like to reply. You take these steps.

1. In Outlook on the web or new Outlook, from the navigation bar select **Groups**, and then select your group name from the list.

1. Select the email.

1. Select **Reply all**.

1. Enter your message, and then select **Send**.

You receive an error that states that Exchange Online "Couldn't send this message."

If you select **More details**, you receive this information.

> This message can't be sent because it no longer exists. It can only be discarded. Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.

## Workaround

Use **Reply** instead of **Reply All**.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when it becomes available.
