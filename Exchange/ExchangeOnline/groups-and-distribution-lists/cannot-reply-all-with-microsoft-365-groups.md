# Can't use Reply All in email messages in Microsoft 365 groups

Consider the following scenario:

- You're a member of a Microsoft 365 group.
- You receive an email message that's addressed to the group, and you want to respond to the message.
- You take the following actions:
   - In Outlook on the web or new Outlook, go to the navigation bar, select **Groups**, and then select your group name from the list.
   - Select the email message.
   - Select **Reply all**.
   - Enter your response, and then select **Send**.

In this scenario, you receive an error message that states that Exchange Online "Couldn't send this message."

If you select **More details**, you see the following information:

> This message can't be sent because it no longer exists. It can only be discarded. Make sure you copy the contents of the message before you discard if you want to use them later.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, use **Reply** instead of **Reply All**.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when it becomes available.
