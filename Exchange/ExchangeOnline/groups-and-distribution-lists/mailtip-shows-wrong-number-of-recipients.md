# MailTip for big distribution group's size wrong in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4056666

## Symptoms

When you send an email message to a large distribution group in Microsoft Exchange Online, a MailTip is displayed that shows the size of the group. The count may be inaccurate and not update correctly when the group membership changes.

This issue seems to affect only some customers and groups.

## Status

The Exchange Engineering team is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
