# Problem adding one or more people to the group when you add an external contact as a guest in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4054864

## Symptoms

When you try to add a guest user to a Microsoft 365 group, you receive the following error message:

> There was a problem adding one or more people to the group. For help, contact your administrator.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the guest user who is being added already exists in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Workaround 1

Delete the user object from the on-premises directory.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the preferred method.

## Workaround 2

Replace the user with a mail contact. To do this, save the user properties, delete the user object, and then create a mail contact that has the same properties.

> [!NOTE]
> When the guest is invited, a new user object is created in Azure AD, and the object coexists together with the mail contact.

## Workaround 3

Move the user object to an organizational unit (OU) in the on-premises directory, and then exclude that OU from synchronizing through Azure AD Connector.

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior deletes the user object from Azure AD, but keeps it available in the on-premises directory. After you make these changes, the guest user can be added to group.
