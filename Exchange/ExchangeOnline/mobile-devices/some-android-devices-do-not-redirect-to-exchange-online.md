# Some Android devices do not redirect to Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3035227

## Symptoms

Some Android devices stop receiving new messages after the user's mailbox is moved to Exchange Online.

## Cause

This occurs if the Android device doesn't support the MobileSyncRedirectBypass feature.

Beginning with Exchange Server 2010 SP3 RU9, Exchange Server 2013 CU8, and Exchange Server 2016, a new MobileSyncRedirectBypass feature was introduced in the Autodiscover service for Android devices.

By default, this feature is enabled for devices that have the following prefixes:

> Acer,ADR9,Ally,Amazon,Android,ASUS,EasClient,FUJITSU,HTC,HUAWEI,LG,LS,Moto,Mozilla,NEC,Nokia,Palm,PANASONIC,PANTECH,Remoba,Samsung,SEMC,SHARP,SONY-,TOSHIBA,Vortex,VS,ZTE

The most recent list of known Android devices that understand this feature can be found in the **MobileSyncRedirectBypassClientPrefixes** setting in the Autodiscover web.config file. This file is located in the *%ExchangeInstallPath%\ClientAccess\Autodiscover* folder.

> [!NOTE]
> The MobileSyncRedirectBypass feature is generally known as **451 redirect**. For more information, see [3.1.5.2.2 HTTP Error 451](/openspecs/exchange_server_protocols/ms-ashttp/a907164a-907c-48b4-b2ef-44a06867f03f).

## Workaround

If the device isn't in the **MobileSyncRedirectBypassClientPrefixes** setting in the Autodiscover web.config file, do one of the following:

- Manually edit the server value for the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) profile after the mailbox is moved to Microsoft 365.
- Test to determine whether the device supports the MobileSyncRedirectBypass feature. If the device supports the feature, edit the **MobileSyncRedirectBypassClientPrefixes** setting across all Exchange servers in the environment.
