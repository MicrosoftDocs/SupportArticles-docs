# Error during mailbox migration from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365

## Symptoms

When you do a mailbox migration from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365, the migration fails and returns the following error message:

> Error MigrationPermanentException: Special credentials are required in order to access this IMAP account. --> Imap server reported an error during LOGIN with the following alert: 'Application-specific password required: `https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833` (Failure).

If you generate a diagnostic report about the migration, you'll see the same error message listed in the report.

## Cause

To migrate a mailbox from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365, you must set up 2-step verification and an app password for the mailbox.

If the Google Workspace mailbox isn't assigned an app password, the Microsoft 365 migration service can't access it during the migration. Instead, the service displays an error message.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, set up an app password for the Google Workspace mailbox:

1. Sign in to the Google Workspace mailbox.
2. Select the mailbox account (profile), and then select **Manage your Google Account**.

3. Select the **Security** tab.

4. Under **Signing in to Google**, select **App passwords**.

6. In the **Select app** list, select **Other *(Custom name)***.

8. Note the generated app password, and then select **DONE**.

9. In the CSV file for the migration, add the generated app password in the **Password** column.

10. Start the migration wizard in the Exchange admin center.
11. Locate the failed migration batch, select the affected mailbox, and then select **Resume migration**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/google-workspace-mailbox-migration-fail/resume-migration.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the migration batches page. The Resume migration button is highlighted." border="false":::

The migration should finish successfully.
