# (You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization) error when you run the Add-RecipientPermission cmdlet

## Problem

### Scenario 1

When you try to run the `Add-RecipientPermission` cmdlet in Exchange Online, you receive the following error message:

> You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization.  
> CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Add-RecipientPermission], NotAcceptedDomainException

### Scenario 2

When you try to run the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet in Exchange Online, in order to move a mailbox from on-premises to Exchange Online, you receive the following error message:

> You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization.  
> CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [New-MoveRequest], NotAcceptedDomainException

### Scenario 3

When you create a migration by using `New-MigrationBatch` command or from Exchange Online Exchange Admin Center, in order to move a mailbox from On-Premises to Exchange Online, after a while the migration will fail. And you'll see the following output on the ErrorSummary when you run:

```powershell
Get-MigrationUserStatistics User1@contoso.com | fl
```

> You can't use the domain because it's not an accepted domain for your organization.

## Cause

The proxy address of the recipient uses a domain that isn't configured as an accepted domain in the organization.

## Solution

Do one of the following:

- Add and verify the domain. For more information, see [Adding additional domains to Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/adding-additional-domains-to-office-365-2d2fa996-b760-411d-a5cc-190d63f13207).
- Remove the proxy address from the recipient. For more information, see [Add or remove email addresses for a mailbox](/Exchange/recipients/user-mailboxes/email-addresses).
- Assign an Exchange Online license to the affected user. For more information, see [Assign licenses to users in Microsoft 365 for business](/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users) or [Assign licenses to user accounts with Microsoft 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/assign-licenses-to-user-accounts-with-office-365-powershell).
