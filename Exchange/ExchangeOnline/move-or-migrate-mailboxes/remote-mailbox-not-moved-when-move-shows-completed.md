# Remote mailbox is not moved from Exchange Server 2010 to Exchange Online when move shows as Completed

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2886058

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario.

- You are using Microsoft 365.
- You perform a move request for a remote mailbox from an on-premises Exchange 2010 server to Exchange Online.
- After you perform the move request, the Exchange Management Console shows the status of the request as **Completed**.

In this scenario, the mailbox isn't moved, and the move request isn't listed on the migration page of the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the on-premises mailbox that you want to move was created in Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013, and you have an on-premises environment that's also running Exchange Server 2010. In this scenario, you can't move the mailbox from an Exchange 2010 server.

## Resolution

Perform the remote mailbox request from the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online.

## More information

To check whether the move process is working correctly, follow these steps:

1. Open the Exchange admin center on the on-premises Exchange server.
2. Select **Office 365**, select **recipients** in the left navigation pane, and then select **migration**.

3. View the move status of the mailboxes. You should see the following values:
   - The status shows as **Syncing** during the mailbox move process.
   - The status shows as **Completed** after the mailbox is successfully moved.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the following cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell to check the status of the migration batch:

```powershell
Get-MigrationBatch -Identity <Batch Name>
```
