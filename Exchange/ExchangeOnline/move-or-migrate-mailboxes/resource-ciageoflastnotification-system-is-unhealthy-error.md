# Resource ‎CiAgeOfLastNotification‎(System)‎ is unhealthy and should not be accessed error when moving mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2931079

## Symptoms

When you try to offboard or move a mailbox, you get the following error message:

> Error:  
Resource ‎'CiAgeOfLastNotification‎(System)‎‎' is unhealthy and shouldn‎'t be accessed

You experience these symptoms in one of the following scenarios:

- You have a hybrid deployment of on-premises Exchange Server and of Exchange Online and you try to move a mailbox from Exchange Online to the on-premises environment.
- You try to perform a cross-forest mailbox move between two on-premises Exchange servers.

## Cause

This issue can occur if an index in the on-premises environment is corrupted.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Rebuild the content index catalog on the on-premises Exchange server. For more information about how to do this, see [Reseed the search catalog](/exchange/reseed-the-search-catalog-exchange-2013-help).
2. After the index catalog is rebuilt, wait a few minutes until the fast engine starts indexing again.
3. Determine whether indexing is completed. To do this, run the `Get-MailboxDatabaseCopyStatus` cmdlet.

   If indexing is completed, the value in the output should show as Healthy.

After indexing is completed, perform the mailbox move request.
