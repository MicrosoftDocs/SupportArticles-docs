# Server name doesn't update after a mailbox is moved to a new region in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4073426

## Symptoms

After a mailbox is moved to a new region in Microsoft 365, the server name doesn't update when you view the mailbox properties by using Remote PowerShell.

## Cause

This behavior is by design.

## Workaround

The database name is updated immediately after the mailbox is moved. Therefore, you can use the database name to verify that the mailbox was successfully moved to a different region.

## References

For a more detailed explanation of this behavior, see the following Microsoft 250 Hello Blog article:
