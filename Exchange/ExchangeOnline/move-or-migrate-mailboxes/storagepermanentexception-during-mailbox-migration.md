# StoragePermanentException transient failures during a mailbox migration

## Symptoms

You use the Microsoft Exchange admin center (EAC) or the [New-MoveRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-moverequest) cmdlet to initiate mailbox migration to or from Microsoft Exchange Online. However, the migration fails.

When you run the [Get-MoveRequestStatistics](/powershell/module/exchange/get-moverequeststatistics) cmdlet to get detailed failure information, the command output contains the following error message:

```output
The job encountered too many transient failures (<transient failure count>) and is quitting.
The most common failure is StoragePermanentException with the hit count <hit count>.
```

## Cause

The source mailbox contains corrupted items. Typically, the error message indicates corruption in any of the following items:

- Folder properties

- Folder views

- Folder restrictions (search folder query filters)

## Workaround

To work around the issue, use either of the following methods.

### Method 1

Use the [Set-MoveRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/set-moverequest) cmdlet together with the `MoveOptions` parameter to exclude potentially corrupted items from the migration. For example, run the following command to recover the migration:

```PowerShell
Set-MoveRequest -Identity <mailbox ID> -MoveOptions:SkipFolderPromotedProperties,SkipFolderViews,SkipFolderRestrictions
```

### Method 2

Use the [New-MoveRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-moverequest) cmdlet together with the `MoveOptions` parameter to exclude potentially corrupted items in a new migration. For example, run the following command to initiate a new migration of the mailbox:

```PowerShell
New-MoveRequest -Identity <mailbox ID> -MoveOptions:SkipFolderPromotedProperties,SkipFolderViews,SkipFolderRestrictions
```
