# The value of WhenCreated is changed in Exchange Online

## Symptoms

In Exchange Online, when you run the Get command to return objects such as user, mailbox, contact, or distribution group, you notice that the `WhenCreated` date is changed.

The following example returns a `WhenCreated` value about Mailbox01.

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Identity Mailbox01 | FL *WhenCreated
```

> WhenCreated : 6/17/2018 5:16:56 AM

After you wait a while, you run this command again, and you notice that the value of `WhenCreated` is changed.  

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -Identity Mailbox01 | FL *WhenCreated
```

> WhenCreated : 10/4/2019 6:23:56 AM

## Cause

This behavior is by design. The `WhenCreated` date is not guaranteed to remain the same. One example of why it might change is after **Tenant Relocation** runs. This is because objects are re-created instead of moved during the process. Therefore, you should not rely on the `WhenCreated` value to do other operations that require that the value remains the same.
