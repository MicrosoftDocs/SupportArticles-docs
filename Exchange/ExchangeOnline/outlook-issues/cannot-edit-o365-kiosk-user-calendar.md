# You can't use Outlook to edit the calendar of a Microsoft 365 Kiosk user

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3203954

## Problem

You can't use Microsoft Outlook to make changes to the calendar of another user who has a Microsoft 365 Kiosk license. This occurs even though you have permissions to the Microsoft 365 Kiosk user's calendar.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. The MAPI and Exchange Web Services (EWS) messaging protocols are disabled in Microsoft 365 Kiosk plans.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, do one of the following:

- Use Outlook on the web to access the calendar.
- Assign the user a license to a Microsoft 365 subscription in which MAPI is enabled. For more information, see [Office applications service description](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-applications-service-description/office-applications-service-description).
