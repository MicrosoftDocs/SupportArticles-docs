# Users can't view the Outlook Delegates page in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4038583

## Symptoms

Users can't view delegate permissions in Microsoft Outlook in Microsoft 365. Additionally, they receive the following error message:

> The Delegates page is not available. Cannot access the Outlook folder.

## Cause

Outlook can't correctly retrieve the delegate information from the local free/busy object in the mailbox. This issue may occur after the manager's or delegate's mailbox is moved to a new forest.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, set a new temporary delegate in the manager's mailbox by using Outlook Web App (OWA) to force updating of the local free/busy object. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the mailbox through OWA.
2. Open the calendar.
3. Select **Share** from the menu at the top.

4. Enter a user or group, and then select **Delegate**  from the drop-down menu.

5. Select **Share**, and then select **Done**.

The manager should now be able to return to Outlook to continue management of the delegates from the client.
