# All users' free/busy info shows in Office 365 modern group calendar

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4057584

## Symptoms

When you view a Microsoft Office 365 modern group calendar in Microsoft Outlook, the free/busy data of all members of the group is displayed, rather than just calendar events. There may be so much data displayed that the calendar is difficult to use.

## Cause

This issue may occur when you open the O365 modern group calendar in this way:

1. Open Outlook.
2. In the **Calendar** view, select **Home** > **Open Calendar** > **From Address Book**.

When you do this, the Office 365 modern group is treated as a distribution list, and the free/busy data of all users is displayed.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, open the Office 365 modern group calendar in the following way:

Open the **Calendar** view in Outlook, expand **All Group Calendars**, and then select the modern group.

The issue won't occur when you view the calendar.
