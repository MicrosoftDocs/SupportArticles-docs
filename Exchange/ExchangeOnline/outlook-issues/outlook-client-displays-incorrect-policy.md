# Outlook client displays Teams or Skype for Business retention policies

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4491013

## Symptoms

The Outlook desktop client uses the Teams or Skype for Business retention policy as the default policy that's applied to the mailbox when the properties of a folder are viewed. The expected behavior is to list the Exchange mailbox policy.

## Cause

If an organization creates multiple retention policies for either Teams or Skype for Business in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, the Outlook client by default displays either the Teams or Skype for Business policy.

The Teams or Skype for Business policy that's displayed in Outlook doesn't apply to a user's mail folders. Therefore, the Outlook client displays the incorrect policy information for the mail folder.

## Resolution

This issue is fixed in Microsoft 365 Apps [Version 2106:June 29](/officeupdates/current-channel#version-2106-june-29).
