# You can't enter text in the body of email messages in Outlook on the web in Internet Explorer

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2935743

## Symptoms

When you compose or reply to email messages in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App (OWA)) in Internet Explorer, you discover that you can't enter text in the body of the email messages.

## Cause

This issue may be caused by a third-party antivirus add-on to your web browser.

## Resolution

Disable the third-party antivirus add-on to your web browser. To do this in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Start Internet Explorer.
2. On the **Tools** menu, select **Manage add-ons**.
3. In the list of add-ons, select the add-on that you want to disable, select **Disable**, and then select **Close**.

You may have to restart Internet Explorer for the changes to take effect.
