# Can't open a calendar from a sharing invitation in Outlook on the web

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3187214

## Problem

A user can't open a calendar from a sharing invitation in Outlook on the web because the **Accept** button is missing. Additionally, an .eml file is attached to the sharing invitation.

## Cause

This issue occurs if a disclaimer transport rule is applied to calendaring messages, and **Wrap** is specified as the fallback action.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Change the fallback action of the disclaimer transport rule from **Wrap** to **Ignore**.
- Change the disclaimer transport rule to skip calendaring sharing invitations. For example, add an exception that specifies the following conditions:

    Except if: **The subject or body** > **subject or body includes any of these words** > has invited you to view their Microsoft Exchange Calendar or Sharing invitation or Sharing request or I'd like to share my calendar with you or You're invited to share this calendar
