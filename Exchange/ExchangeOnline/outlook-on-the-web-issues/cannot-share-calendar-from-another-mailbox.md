# You can't share the Calendar from another mailbox by using Outlook Web App in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4091516

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You try to open another mailbox by using Outlook Web App (OWA) in Microsoft 365.
- You have **Full Access** permissions for the mailbox.
- You locate the Calendar for the mailbox, and then you select **Share**.

In this scenario, nothing happens. You can't share the calendar.

## Resolution

We have re-enabled the ability for **Full Access** users to share a calendar. The fix is fully available worldwide (build 526).

With this fix, a **Full Access** user in OWA will again see the option to share. When they add or change permissions, the associated sharing invitation email message will be sent.

The **Full Access** user can also remove permissions, but no email message will be sent.
