# The time zone setting in Outlook Web App in Office 365 is set incorrectly to "(UTC) Monrovia, Reykjavik"

## Problem 

A Microsoft Office 365 user says that the time zone setting in Microsoft Outlook Web App is incorrect. Instead of being set to the user's current time zone, the time zone setting is set to **(UTC) Monrovia, Reykjavik**.

## Cause 

This issue occurs if the user didn't set the time zone to the correct setting when he or she first signed in to Outlook Web App.

The first time that a user signs in to Outlook Web App, the user has to set his or her current time zone. If the user doesn't set the time zone, the time zone is set to **(UTC) Monrovia, Reykjavik**. There's no method for admins to set up the time zone setting in advance in Outlook Web App for all users.
