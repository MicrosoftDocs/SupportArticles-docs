# "An item with the specified id wasn't found in the store" error when adding reviewer permission to public folder calendar

## Symptoms

When you try to add a reviewer permission to a public folder calendar by using Exchange Online PowerShell, you receive the following error message:

```
Add-PublicFolderClientPermission -Identity "\publiccalendartest" -User "User" -AccessRights Reviewer

An item with the specified id 'LgAAAAAaRHOQqmYRzZvIAKoAL8RaAwBUKPrqV1IcSb2sevrqOMn6AAAAAAAkAAAB' wasn't found in the store.
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Add-PublicFolderClientPermission], ObjectNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : [Server=DM6PR01MB4009,RequestId=46aec6d8-b520-4c95-902e-c94959c7cf71,TimeStamp=3/12/2020

```

## Workarounds

### Method 1

Use the Microsoft Outlook client to add the reviewer permission to the calendar. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Locate the public folder calendar that you want to add the permission to.
2. Right-click the calendar, and select **Properties**.
3. Under the **Permissions** tab, select **Add**.  
4. In the **Add** box, type a contact name or email address, and then select **OK** to add the contact.
5. In the calendar's **Properties** dialog box, select the contact's name or email address.
6. Under **Permission Level**, select **Reviewer**, and then select **OK**.

### Method 2

Use EAC to add the reviewer permission to the calendar. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Use your administrator account to sign in to EAC.
2. Go to **Public Folders** > **Public Folders**
3. Select the public folder calendar that you want to add the permission to.
4. In the details pane, go to **Folder Permissions** > **Manage**.
5. Select the Plus Sign (+) button, and then select **Browse** to select a user.
6. Under **Permission Level**, select the **Reviewer** permission, and then select **Save**.

### Method 3

Grant the **Folder Visible** access right. Actually, the **Reviewer** role will add the **Folder Visible** access right to the public folder. To do the same, run the following command:

```powershell
Add-PublicFolderClientPermission -Identity "\publiccalendartest" -User "User" -AccessRights ReadItems,FolderVisible
```

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when it becomes available.
