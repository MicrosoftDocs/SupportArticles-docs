# "Cannot find a recipient that has mailbox GUID" error when creating migration endpoint

## Symptoms

Assume that you're migrating public folders from an on-premises server that's running Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2013, or Exchange Server 2010 to Exchange Online. You try to run the following cmdlet to create a migration endpoint:

```powershell
New-MigrationEndpoint -Name <PublicFolderEndpoint> -PublicFolder -RemoteServer <mail.contoso.com> -Credentials $c
```

However, you receive the following error message:

> cmdlet New-MigrationEndpoint at command pipeline position 1  
> Supply values for the following parameters:  
> Name: PublicFolderEndpoint  
> Cannot find a recipient that has mailbox GUID '\<GUID\>'.

## Cause

This issue might occur if you run the `New-MigrationEndpoint` cmdlet immediately after you create target public folder mailboxes in Exchange Online.

## Workaround

This is a transient issue that should discontinue after the Active Directory replication is completed successfully. Wait for an hour, and then try again to create the migration endpoint.
