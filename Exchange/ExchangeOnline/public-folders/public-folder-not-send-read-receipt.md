# Read receipt isn't sent from mail-enabled public folder

When you send an email that requests a read receipt to a mail-enabled public folder, you receive a read receipt from the public folder mailbox that is hosting the public folder, but not from the public folder.

This is a known issue of read receipts. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
