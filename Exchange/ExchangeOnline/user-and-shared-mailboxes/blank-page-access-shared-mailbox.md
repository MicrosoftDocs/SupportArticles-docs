_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2863260

## Problem

Microsoft 365 users see a blank page when they try to access a shared mailbox by using Outlook Web App.

This problem occurs because you can't use Outlook Web App in Microsoft 365 to directly access a shared mailbox.

## Solution

To open a shared mailbox in Outlook Web App, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://portal.office.com).
2. Select **Outlook**.
3. In the upper-right corner of the page, select the user name, and then select **Open another mailbox**.
4. Type the name of the shared mailbox, and then select **Open**.
