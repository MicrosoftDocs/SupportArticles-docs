**Who is it for?**

Administrators who help create and manage resource mailboxes in Microsoft 365.

**Estimated time of completion:**

## Which Microsoft 365 plan do you use

Not sure which Microsoft 365 plan your organization uses? Go to [http://portal.microsoftonline.com](http://portal.microsoftonline.com) and sign in using your Microsoft 365 administrator credentials.

### Use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to create and manage resource mailboxes

The following procedure shows you how to create and manage resource mailboxes:

Before you begin, sign in to the [Exchange admin center](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/) (EAC) at using your Microsoft 365 tenant administrator credentials. As a Microsoft 365 Small Business admin, you need to access EAC by using the direct URL. The Microsoft 365 Small Business Microsoft Online Portal does not have an option to access EAC.

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients > Resources**.
2. To create a room mailbox, select **New+** > **Room mailbox**. To create an equipment mailbox, select **New+** > **Equipment mailbox**.
3. Use the options on the page to specify the settings for the new resource mailbox.

After you create a room mailbox or equipment mailbox, you manage its settings by editing the resource mailbox using EAC. For detailed information about the available settings for resource mailboxes, see [Create and Manage Room Mailboxes](/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes) and [Manage Equipment Mailboxes](/exchange/recipients/equipment-mailboxes).
