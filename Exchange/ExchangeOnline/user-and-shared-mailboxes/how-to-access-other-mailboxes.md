# Accessing other people's mailboxes in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 10048

This article explains how to assign access permissions to a user mailbox, to multiple mailboxes, and to individual users in Microsoft 365.

**Who is it for?**

Microsoft 365 administrators who help set up access permissions for users to open other people's mailboxes.

**How does it work?**

We'll begin by asking you the task you want to do. Then we'll take you through a series of steps that are specific to your situation.

**Estimated time of completion:**

10-15 minutes.

## Welcome to the guide

Select the scenario that you are trying to configure for your users. Once you select the appropriate scenario below, the step-by-step instructions will be provided.

- [I need to access somebody else's mailbox](#which-microsoft-365-plan-do-you-use).
- [Set up permissions to access multiple mailboxes](#set-up-permissions-to-access-multiple-mailboxes).

## Which Microsoft 365 plan do you use

Select the plan that your organization subscribes to in Microsoft 365.

Not sure which Microsoft 365 plan your organization uses? Go to [https://portal.microsoftonline.com](https://portal.microsoftonline.com) and login using your Microsoft 365 administrator credentials.

### How do I access the mailbox (Small Business)

#### Use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to assign permissions

The following procedure shows how to assign full permissions to a user mailbox:

Before you begin, sign in to the Exchange admin center (EAC) at [https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/](https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/) using your Microsoft 365 tenant administrator credentials. As a Microsoft 365 Small Business admin, you need to access EAC by using the direct URL. The Microsoft 365 Small Business Microsoft Online Portal does not have an option to access EAC.

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Recipients** > **Mailboxes**.
2. In the list of mailboxes, select the mailbox that you want to assign permissions for, and then select **Edit**:::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/edit-icon.gif":::.
3. On the mailbox properties page, select **Mailbox Delegation**.

4. To assign permissions to delegates, select **Add**:::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/add-icon.gif"::: under **Full Access** to display a page that lists all recipients in your Exchange organization that can be assigned the permission. Select the recipients you want, add them to the list, and then select **OK**. You can also search for a specific recipient by typing the recipient's name in the search box and then selecting **Search**:::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/search-icon.gif":::. To remove a permission for a recipient, under the appropriate permission, select the recipient and then select **Remove**:::image type="icon" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/remove-icon.gif":::.

5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

##### How do I access the mailbox

Depending on the email client you choose, the detailed instructions for accessing the mailbox that you have Full Access permissions to are listed below:

**Outlook**

If you are using Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2010, the mailbox for which you have been granted access automatically display in your folder list. In the example below, Adam Barr has been granted access to the mailbox of Kim Akers. Kim's mailbox displays automatically in Adam's folder list in Outlook 2013.

> [!NOTE]
> If you were recently granted access to the mailbox, it may take a few hours for the other user's mailbox to display in your folder list.
>
> :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/others-mailboxes-listed-your-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of other user's mailbox shown in your folder.":::

**Outlook Web App**

After you complete this procedure, the person's mailbox for which you have been provided access to will display in your Outlook Web App folder list every time you open Outlook Web App.

1. Sign in to your mailbox using Outlook Web App.
2. Right-click **Folders** in the left navigation pane, and then select **Add shared folder**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/add-shared-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the add shared folder entry after right-clicking Folders.":::

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/mailbox-shown-owa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the the mailbox appearing in your Outlook Web App." :::

If you decide that you no longer want to see the other person's mailbox every time you open Outlook Web App, right-click the folder, and select **Remove shared folder**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-access-other-mailboxes/remove-shared-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the remove shared folder entry when right-clicking the folder.":::

### Set up permissions to access multiple mailboxes

You can assign access permissions to multiple mailboxes for the entire mailbox or specific folders in the mailbox. You can also choose to assign access permissions to individual user or group.

Select if you would like permissions to be assigned on the mailbox level (access to all of the mailbox folders) or just specific folders within the mailbox (access only folders specifically shared).

- [Entire mailbox](#how-do-i-access-the-mailbox-entire-mailbox)
- [Specific folders only](#assign-access-to-specific-folders-in-a-users-mailbox)

### How do I access the mailbox (Entire Mailbox)

#### Assign permissions to the entire mailbox

You may want to perform this procedure as if an administrator in your organization needs to have access to all mailboxes in the organization.

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For info about how to do this, go to the following Microsoft website:

   [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell)

2. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

   ```powershell
   Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter {(RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'UserMailbox') -and (Alias -ne 'Admin')} | Add-MailboxPermission -User AdministratorAccount@contoso.com -AccessRights fullaccess -InheritanceType all
   ```

After you perform these steps, the specified user will be able to access **all** user mailboxes in Microsoft 365. The user will be able to view the contents of the mailboxes from either Outlook or Outlook Web App.

For more information, see [How to use Windows PowerShell to grant an admin access to all user mailboxes in Microsoft 365](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2685435).

To assign permissions to a user mailbox, run the following command:

```powershell
Add-MailboxPermission -Identity ayla@contoso.com -User Ed@contoso.com -AccessRights fullaccess -InheritanceType all
```
This example assigns the user Ed Full Access permission to Ayla's mailbox.

##### How do I access the mailbox

### Assign access to specific folders in a user's mailbox

This example assigns permissions for a user to access specific folders in another user's mailbox in an Exchange Online or Microsoft 365 environment. Do the following:

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information about how to do this, go to [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. Enter a command using the following syntax to assign access permissions to the specific folder:

    ```powershell
    Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity <SMTP address or alias of recipient> : <Folder path>-AccessRights <Permission you want to grant the recipient> -User <SMTP address or alias of recipient to be granted access>
    ```

3. This example assigns permissions for Ed to access Ayla's Marketing mailbox folder and applies the Owner role to Ed's access of that folder.

   ```powershell
   Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity ayla@contoso.com:\Marketing -User Ed@contoso.com -AccessRights Owner
   ```

For more information, see [Add-MailboxFolderPermission](/powershell/module/exchange/add-mailboxfolderpermission).
