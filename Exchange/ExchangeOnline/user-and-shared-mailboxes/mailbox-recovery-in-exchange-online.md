# Restore user mailboxes (mailbox recovery) in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 20804

**Who is it for?**

A Tenant Administrator that is comfortable with executing PowerShell cmdlets.

**How does it work?**

We are going to ask you some specific questions to scope your situation. Then we'll take you through a series of steps tailored to your scenario.

**Estimated time of completion:**

30-45 minutes.

## Select the current state of the on-premises user account

If there is no [Directory Synchronization](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-integration?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the environment, then the **Managed Account** option should be selected.

If Directory Synchronization is in place, you can search within **Active Directory Users and Computers** to see if the on-premises account is **Present** or **Deleted**.

- [Managed Account (No DirSync)](#azure-active-directory-user-account-status-managed-account-no-dirsync)
- [User Account is present on-premises](#azure-active-directory-user-account-status-user-account-is-present-on-premises)
- [User Account deleted on-premises](#azure-active-directory-user-account-status-user-account-deleted-on-premises)

### Azure Active Directory User Account Status (Managed Account (No DirSync))

Connect to Azure Active Directory PowerShell and verify the Online Account Status:

1. Install [Azure AD Module](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)).
2. Open the Microsoft Online Services Module (shortcut from the desktop).
3. Run `$cred=Get-Credential`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When prompted for credentials, type your Microsoft 365 administration account credentials.

4. Run `Connect-MsolService -Credential $cred`. This cmdlet connects you to Microsoft 365.
5. Run `Get-MSOLUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN>`.

    Example: UserPrincipalName: user@contoso.com  
    If the user information is returned the user is **PRESENT**. If the user information is not returned, proceed to step 6.

6. Run `Get-MSOLUser -UserPrincipalName <UPN>-ReturnDeletedUsers |SELECT-OBJECT`.  
   If the user information is returned, the user is **SOFT DELETED**.

7. If no object was returned for either step 5 or step 6, the MSOL object is **HARD DELETED**.

Based on the outcome in the steps above, select one of the following:

- [Present](#exchange-online-mailbox-status-on-premises-is-managed-account-no-dirsync-and-online-account-status-is-present)
- [Soft Deleted](#exchange-online-mailbox-status-on-premises-is-managed-account-no-dirsync-and-online-account-status-is-soft-deleted)
- [Hard Deleted](#exchange-online-mailbox-status-on-premises-is-managed-account-no-dirsync-and-online-account-status-is-hard-deleted)

### Exchange Online Mailbox Status (on-premises is Managed Account (No DirSync) and online account status is Present)

Connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) and verify the status of the Exchange Online Mailbox using the instructions below:

1. Ensure the [Exchange Online PowerShell module](/powershell/exchange/exchange-online-powershell-v2) is [installed](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell#connect-to-exchange-online-powershell-using-modern-authentication-with-or-without-mfa).

2. Connect to Exchange Online by running the command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-ExchangeOnline
   ```

   When prompted, enter the credentials for your Microsoft 365 admin account. If the account has multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled, you'll also need to enter a security code.

3. Run `Get-Mailbox -Identity <user Alias>`.  
   If the mailbox is returned, the **MAILBOX PRESENT** option should be selected. If not, go to step 4.

4. Run `Get-Mailbox -SoftDeletedMailbox -identity <user Alias>`.  
   If the mailbox is returned, the **MAILBOX SOFT DELETED** option should be selected. If not, go to step 5.

5. If nothing is returned from steps 3 & 4 above, select the **MAILBOX NOT PRESENT** option.

### AD User Account Deleted, Online Account Present, Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
Contact Microsoft Support

When an Active Directory User object is deleted from on-premises, the deletion will be synchronized to Azure Active Directory. This synchronization process could take up to three hours. If the deletion has not synchronized yet, there may be an issue with the directory synchronization application.

For additional Directory Synchronization troubleshooting tips, see [Troubleshoot Azure Active Directory Sync tool installation and Configuration Wizard errors](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/installation-configuration-wizard-errors).

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD User Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Present, Online Mailbox not present

**Solution:**  
Contact Microsoft Support Due to the way Azure Active Directory Connect and the Online Services work, this should not be a possible scenario. Contact Microsoft Support to get assistance with your issue.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Present (Soft deleted), Online Mailbox Soft Deleted

**Solution**:  
Restore the AD user and run directory synchronization, which will "soft match" the AD user object and the Azure AD object, including reconnecting the "soft deleted" mailbox.

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Restore the [onPremise AD User](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd379509(v=ws.10)).
3. Run a Delta Directory Sync.
4. Apply a new exchange [online license](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to the newly created Azure AD object.
5. Use the [New-MailboxRestoreRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxrestorerequest) to merge the content of the **soft deleted** mailbox to the active mailbox. See an example in the screen capture below:

   :::image type="content" source="media/mailbox-recovery-in-exchange-online/new-mailbox-restore-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example to use the New-MailboxRestoreRequest command." border="false" lightbox="media/mailbox-recovery-in-exchange-online/new-mailbox-restore-request.png":::

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD User Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Hard Deleted, Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
Recreate the user and restore the data from the original mailbox.

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online remote PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. Attempt to delete mailbox using by using the [Remove-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-mailbox) cmdlet on the affected mailboxExample:  
   From the Exchange Online PowerShell, run: `Remove-Mailbox`.

3. If step 2 fails, skip to step 8.

4. Restore the [on-premises AD User](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd379481(v=ws.10)).

5. Run a Delta Directory Sync.

6. Apply a new exchange [online license](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to the newly created Azure AD object.

7. Use the [New-MailboxRestoreRequest](/powershell/module/exchange/new-mailboxrestorerequest) to merge the content of the soft deleted mailbox to the active mailbox. See an example in the screen capture below:

    :::image type="content" source="media/mailbox-recovery-in-exchange-online/new-mailbox-restore-request.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example of using the New-MailboxRestoreRequest command." border="false" lightbox="media/mailbox-recovery-in-exchange-online/new-mailbox-restore-request.png":::

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD User Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Hard Deleted, Online Mailbox Not present

**Solution:**  
By Design

This situation is expected behavior if the customer deleted the on-premises object 30+ days ago. The mailbox is not recoverable at this point.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD User Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Hard Deleted, Online Mailbox Soft Deleted

**Solution:**  

Restore Inactive mailbox and perform a **soft match**.

1. Connect to Azure AD PowerShell. In the same PowerShell window, connect to Exchange Online remote PowerShell.

2. Connect the Soft Deleted Mailbox to a new Azure AD Account with the steps below:

   1. If the tenant IS NOT using SSO (Single Sign-On), run the cmdlet:  
      `New-Mailbox -Name "UserName" -InactiveMailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID UserName@contoso.com -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Pa$$word1' -AsPlainText –Force)`
   2. If the tenant IS using ADFS (Identity Federation), run the cmdlet:  
      `New-Mailbox -Name "UserName" -InactiveMailbox -MicrosoftOnlineServicesID UserName@contoso.onmicrosoft.com -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String 'Pa$$word1' -AsPlainText –Force)`

3. [Restore](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/dd379481(v=ws.10)) or create a new On-premises AD user. Ensure that the on-premises account's Primary SMTP Address matches the Primary SMTP Address of the Microsoft 365 object. Change the on-premises object's address to match if it does not.

4. Using [Azure Active Directory Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-hybrid-identity) to run a Directory synchronization will soft match the on-premises account with the new Azure AD account.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### AD User Account Deleted, Azure AD Account Soft Deleted, Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
If the Account is soft deleted the mailbox should not be present. However, we will take you through the steps to attempt to recreate the user and reconnect them to the original mailbox.

To identify duplicates, run the following:

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. Run `Get-msoluser -returndeletedusers -userprincipalname user@contoso.com |Select-Object ObjectID`.

3. Run `Get-mailbox user@contoso.com |Select-Object ExternalDirectoryObjectID, UserPrincipalName`.

    - If the Object IDs match from step 2 and 3, then follow continue to step 4.
    - If the Objects ID's do not match from step 2 and 3, contact Microsoft support.

4. Create a new On-premises AD user and ensure that the on-premises accounts Primary SMTP Address matches the Primary SMTP Address of the Microsoft 365 object.

5. Ensure the UPN of the AD user object matches what was returned in step 3.
6. Wait three hours for the account to replicate to the Online services.
7. If the Mailbox did not reconnect, contact Microsoft Support.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Present, Exchange Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
Service is functioning normally.

This is the expected behavior of the Exchange Online Services.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Present, Exchange Online Mailbox Soft Deleted

**Solution:**  
Follow the steps below to recover the mailbox.

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

     - Run `$DelUser = Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName User@contoso.com -ReturnDeletedUsers`.
     - `Restore-MsolUser -ObjectId $DelUser.ObjectId`.
6. After 5 minutes, restore the Azure AD user using the steps below.
7. If the `ExternalDirectoryObjectID` values from step 2 and step 3 do not match, it means there is a duplicate Azure AD user. Contact support.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Present, Exchange Online Mailbox Not present (Purged)

Solution:  
This issue is often caused by having an unlicensed user account.

1. Log in to the Microsoft 365 portal at [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com/) and check the user's [license status](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users).
2. Check to see if the user has a valid license. If user doesn't have a valid license, [apply](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) an Exchange Online License.
3. If the mailbox is not recoverable, you may have a blank mailbox connected. While it is unlikely that we can recover your data you can call into support.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Soft Deleted, Exchange Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
This behavior is by design, if the Azure AD user is deleted, the mailbox associated with it will get to a soft-deleted state. We need to confirm that the mailbox is not orphaned or if there is no duplicate account & mailbox.

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Run `get-mailbox -identity User@contoso.com |Select-Object ExternalDirectoryObjectID`.
3. Run `get-msoluser -objectID < specify ExternalDirectoryObjectID from step 2> -returnDeletedUsers |select-object`.
4. Confirm that the MSOLUser is returned from step 3 and then, simply restore the deleted MSOL user back to an Active user using the steps below:
   - Run `$DelUser = Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName User@contoso.com -ReturnDeletedUsers`.
   - Run `Restore-MsolUser -ObjectId $DelUser.ObjectId`.
5. Log in to the mailbox using the `UserPrincipalName` and verify you are able to access the mailbox.

> [!NOTE]
> If step 2 & 3 don't yield any results, there may be a duplicate Azure AD object or this mailbox is orphaned. Contact support to resolve the issue.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Online Account Soft Deleted, Online Mailbox Soft Deleted

**Solution:**  
Synchronize the user account to allow the mailbox to automatically reconnect to the user.

1. Using the on-premises Active Directory Users and Computers, move the user to an Organizational Unit that is not filtered in directory synchronization.
2. Force delta synchronization.
3. After synchronization is complete, confirm that the user is present in Azure AD (through **O365 admin center** > **Active users**). The mailbox will get reconnected to the Azure AD user automatically.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Online Account Soft Deleted, Online Mailbox is not present (Purged)

**Solution:**  
Follow the steps below to review the license status of the user. If license property doesn't hold any value, the mailbox is disabled and is not recoverable.

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)).
2. Check License on the object using:

   `get-msoluser -userprincipalname user@contoso.com |Select-object Licenses`
3. If license property doesn't hold any value, the mailbox is not recoverable.
4. Using the on-premises Active Directory Users and Computers, move the user to an Organizational Unit that is not filtered in directory synchronization.
5. Run a Delta Directory synchronization.
6. Once Azure AD user (MSOL User) has been restored, [apply a license](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/add-users) to provision new mailbox.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Hard Deleted, Online Mailbox Present

**Solution:**  
Contact Microsoft Support

This scenario should not be possible because of the way Exchange Online Account provisioning in Microsoft 365 works. It would be best to contact Microsoft Support so we can assist in working out the best solution for this issue.

- If your issue is resolved, congratulations! Your scenario is complete.
- If your issue isn't resolved, see [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

### Azure AD Account Hard Deleted, Exchange Online Mailbox Soft Deleted

**Solution:**  

1. Connect to [Azure AD PowerShell](/previous-versions/azure/jj151815(v=azure.100)). In the same PowerShell window, connect to [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).

2. Next, determine the state of the soft-deleted mailbox.

   Run `Get-mailbox –softdeletedmailbox –identity "<UserPrincipalName of the user>" |select-object IsInactiveMailbox`.

3. Based on the value of `IsInactiveMailbox`, take the appropriate steps:
