# Microsoft 365 groups aren't visible from a shared mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3191498

## Symptoms

A profile for a Microsoft 365 shared mailbox can't see any Microsoft 365 groups in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook on the web. This issue occurs even though the shared mailbox is a member of the Microsoft 365 group.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. Microsoft 365 groups don't support explicit logon, and shared mailboxes don't have an enabled user account that's used for logging on.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, convert the shared mailbox to a regular mailbox. For information about how to do this, see [Convert a mailbox](/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/convert-a-mailbox).
