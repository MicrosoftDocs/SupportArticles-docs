# Private items aren't displayed in a shared mailbox in Outlook

In Microsoft Outlook, items such as email messages or meeting requests that are in a shared mailbox and [marked as "Private"](https://support.microsoft.com/office/mark-your-email-as-normal-personal-private-or-confidential-4a76d05b-6c29-4a0d-9096-71784a6b12c1) aren't displayed in the **Inbox**. This behavior is by design.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the sender can set the sensitivity level of the item. This option is unavailable in the recipient's **Inbox**.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods:

- Use Outlook on the Web (OWA).
- Add the user as a delegate to the shared mailbox who has access to private items.

    In PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity ayla@contoso.com:\Calendar -User laura@contoso.com -AccessRights Editor -SharingPermissionFlags Delegate,CanViewPrivateItems
    ```
    > [!NOTE]
    > Although this cmdlet specifies **Calendar** as the target folder, it also enables you to view private items in the **Inbox** folder.
    
    In Outlook:

    1. Select **File** > **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access**
    2. Double-click the username of the delegate or select **Add** to add a new delegate.
    3. In the **Delegate Permissions** dialog box, select the **Delegate can see my private items** check box.
    4. Select **OK**.
- In Outlook, add the shared mailbox as an [additional account](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b) by using the email address and password of the user who has permission for that mailbox.

    Make sure that automapping is removed and the mailbox is not added as an additional mailbox.
