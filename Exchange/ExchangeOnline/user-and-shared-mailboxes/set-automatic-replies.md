# How to set automatic replies on a user's mailbox in Microsoft 365

## Introduction

This article describes four methods that administrators can use to set automatic "out of office" replies on a user's mailbox in Microsoft 365.

## Method 1

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 portal.
1. Locate **Users** > **Active users** (or **Groups** > **Shared mailboxes** if you set this on a shared mailbox).
1. Select a user who has a Microsoft Exchange mailbox.
1. On the flyout menu on the right, locate **Mail settings** > **Automatic replies** (if it's a shared mailbox, just locate **Automatic replies** on the flyout).

## Method 2

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin portal by using administrator credentials.
1. Expand **Admin Centers**, and then select **Exchange**.
1. Click the picture in the upper-right corner, select **Another User**, and then select the user mailbox that you want to change.
1. On the left side, select **Options**, click **Organize E-mail**, and then click **Automatic replies**.

## Method 3

Run the following cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration
```
