# 1009 errors flood Application log for lagged database copies in Exchange Server 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;4023757

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have Exchange Database Availability Groups (DAGs) deployed in your organization and enabled lagged database copies configuration.
- You have Cumulative Update 4 or Cumulative Update 5 installed for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 installed.

In this situation, you notice many warning messages with **event ID 1009**  in the Application log in Exchange Server 2016. The message resembles the following:

```console
Log Name: <Log Name>
Source: MSExchangeFastSearch
Date: <Date>
Event ID: 1009
Task Category: General
Level: Warning
Keywords: <Keywords>
User: N/A
Computer: <Computer Name>
Description:
The indexing of mailbox database <Database Name> encountered an unexpected exception. Error details: Microsoft.Exchange.Search.Core.Abstraction.OperationFailedException: The component operation has failed. ---> Microsoft.Exchange.Search.Core.Abstraction.OperationFailedException: The component operation has failed. ---> Microsoft.Exchange.Search.Engine.FeedingSkippedException: "Feeding was skipped for <Database ID> due to the state 'Unknown', error code: 'Unknown'."
```

## Resolution

You can safely ignore these logged events. However, [Cumulative Update 6 for Exchange Server 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4012108) includes a change that represses these messages.
