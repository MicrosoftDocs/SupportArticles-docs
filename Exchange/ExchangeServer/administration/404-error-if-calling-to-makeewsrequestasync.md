# 404 error and a call to makeEwsRequestAsync fails from a server that has split CAS/MBX roles in Exchange Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4476965

## Summary

Consider the following scenario:

- You're running Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 19 (CU19) or a later version.
- The server that's running Exchange Server is configured to have split Client Access server (CAS) and Mailbox server (MBX) roles.
- A Modern add-in calls the **makeEwsRequestAsync** function from any supported client, such as the [Outlook client](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/web-services).

In this scenario, the call fails and returns a **404** error message.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, install the CAS role on each Mailbox server. This is the preferred architecture for Exchange Server 2013.

## Status

This is a known issue in Exchange 2013 CU19 and later versions.
