# Unable to access a mailbox with Receive-As permissions on a mailbox database

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3176596

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- Administrator/service account is a member of the Organization Management group.
- User mailboxes are located in Database1.
- Administrator/service account is granted the Receive-As permission to Database1.

In this scenario, the administrator/service account is unable to open another user's mailbox on Database1.

## Cause

The security model was changed in Microsoft Exchange Server 2013. A user that's a member of the Organization Management group can only have access to other mailboxes when Full Access is explicitly provided.

## Resolution

There are two possible solutions for this issue:

- Use an account that's not a member of the Organization Management group.
- Provide explicit Full Access permissions to the mailbox.
