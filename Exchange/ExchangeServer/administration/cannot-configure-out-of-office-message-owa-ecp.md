# Users receive an error (object couldn't be found) and can't configure Out of Office messages in Outlook Web App or Exchange Control Panel

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3124055

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have an Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) multi-domain environment.
- In this environment, Active Directory user accounts are located in a different AD domain than the AD domain in which Exchange Server 2016 is installed. For example, Exchange Server 2016 is installed in Child.Contoso.com and user accounts are located in contoso.com.

In this scenario, users can't configure an Out of Office message from within Outlook Web App or the Exchange Control Panel (ECP).

Additionally, users receive the following error message:

> The operation couldn't be performed because object 'contoso.com/Users/A2' couldn't be found on 'condc2.child.contoso.com'.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, revert to the classic ECP user interface. To do this, Use follow these steps:

1. Sign in to ECP.
2. On the **Options** menu, expand **Mail**, and then click **Other**.
