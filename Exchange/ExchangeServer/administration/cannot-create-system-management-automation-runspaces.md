# You can't create multiple System.Management.Automation runspaces in a web app for two or more different users

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3115600

## Symptoms

When you try to allow multiple users to create System.Management.Automation runspaces in a web application and you're using implicit credentials (for example, credentials from impersonation), you notice that only the first user who accesses the web application can call the `CreateRunspace` method. All subsequent requests fail with an exception that resembles:

> System.Management.Automation.PSInvalidOperationException  
at System.Management.Automation.Remoting.Client.WSManClientSessionTransportManager.Initialize  
at System.Management.Automation.Remoting.Client.WSManClientSessionTransportManager..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.Remoting.ClientRemoteSessionDSHandlerImpl..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.Remoting.ClientRemoteSessionImpl..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.Internal.ClientRunspacePoolDataStructureHandler..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Internal.RemoteRunspacePoolInternal.CreateDSHandler  
at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.RemoteRunspace..ctor  
at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace  
at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace

## Cause

This behavior is by design.

## Workaround

To create multiple System.Management.Automation runspaces in a web application for two or more different users, you must pass in explicit credentials.

## More information

To create multiple remote management runspaces, make sure that the following conditions are true:

- ASP.NET impersonation isn't enabled on the IIS virtual directory.
- All Windows impersonation logic has been removed from your code.
- Your users are prompted for a user name and password.
