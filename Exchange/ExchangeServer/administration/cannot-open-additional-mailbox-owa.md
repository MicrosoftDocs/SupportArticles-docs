# You can't open an additional mailbox in Outlook Web App after you install Update Rollup 4 for Exchange Server 2010 SP2

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2777852

## Symptoms

Assume that you apply Update Rollup 4 for Exchange Server 2010 SP2. Then, you try to open an additional mailbox in Outlook Web App. The primary SMTP email address of the additional mailbox isn't in the accepted domain list. In this situation, you receive the following error message:

```console
Request:
Url: https://localhost:443/owa/auth.owa
User host address: ::1
OWA version: 14.2.318.2
Exception:
Exception type: System.ArgumentNullException
Exception message: Value cannot be null. Parameter name: organizationId

System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute()
System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStep(IExecutionStep step, Boolean& completedSynchronously)
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because of a design change that was introduced in Update Rollup 4 for Exchange 2010 Service Pack 2.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, add the primary SMTP email domain of the additional mailbox to the accepted domain list. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft Exchange Server 2010**, and then click **Exchange Management Console**.
2. In the **Exchange Management Console** tree, click **Organization Configuration**, and then click **Hub Transport**.
3. In the result pane, click the **Accepted Domains** tab, right-click an empty area, click **New Accepted Domain**, and then follow the **New Accepted Domain** wizard to create the accepted domain.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For more information about how to create a new accepted domain, see [How to Create Accepted Domains](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2007/aa996910(v=exchg.80)).
