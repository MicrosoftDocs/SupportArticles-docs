# Can't remove a remote shared mailbox by using the Exchange admin center on Exchange Server

## Symptoms

In an Exchange hybrid deployment, when you try to remove a remote shared mailbox by using the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Server, you receive the following error message:

> \<Mailbox_name> isn't a mailbox user.  

## Cause

This issue occurs because the EAC attempts to use the `Remove-Mailbox` cmdlet to remove the mailbox, but this cmdlet is unable to find the specified mailbox object. This behavior can be verified by checking the logs for the commands that were run.

## Workaround

To remove the remote shared mailbox, run the [Remove-RemoteMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/remove-remotemailbox) cmdlet in [Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell) instead.
