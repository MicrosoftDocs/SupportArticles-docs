# You cannot restore an individual database by using Windows Server Backup in Exchange Server

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2735099

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You must restore a mailbox in Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2007.
- The computer that is running Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2007 hosts multiple mailbox databases.
- You try to use Windows Server Backup to restore the individual mailbox. This mailbox is located in a specific database.

In this scenario, you cannot restore the individual mailbox or the individual database. When you try to use Windows Server Backup to restore the mailbox, the only option available is to restore all the databases if one of the following conditions is true:

- The backup that is being restored is a Full Volume backup, and multiple databases are hosted on the same volume.
- The backup that is being restored is a Full Server backup, and the server hosts multiple databases.

(The screenshots for this issue are listed below).

## Cause

This issue occurs because Windows Server Backup only lets you restore all databases.

> 1. Select **Recover to original location** to recover backed-up data to its original location. If you use this option, you cannot set a single database or multiple databases. All backed-up databases are restored to their original locations.
>
> 2. Select **Recover to another location** to restore multiple databases to a custom location. To do this, select **Browse** to specify the other location. If you use this option, you can restore a single database or multiple databases into a custom location. After the databases are restored, the data files can then be moved into a recovery database and manually moved back to their original locations. When you restore databases to another location, the restored database is in a Dirty Shutdown state.
