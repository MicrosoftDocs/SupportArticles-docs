# You can't restore a LUN drive in Exchange Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2872889

## Symptoms

You try to use an Exchange-aware backup program such as EMC AppSync to restore a whole volume or a LUN drive in Exchange Server 2013. However, the operation fails. This issue does not occur in Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2007.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. It occurs because the Microsoft Exchange Search Host Controller service locks the database files even if the database is dismounted.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, disable the Microsoft Exchange Search Host Controller service, and then restore the volume or LUN.
