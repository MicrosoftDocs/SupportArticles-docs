# Error when users reset Windows password in an Exchange environment: Unable to update the password
  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3090164

## Symptoms

Users in a Microsoft Exchange Server environment receive the following error message when they try to set a new password for Windows:

> Unable to update the password. The value provided for the new password does not meet the length, complexity, or history requirements of the domain.

> [!NOTE]
> The Exchange ActiveSync mailbox policy setting is configured to use the following password requirements:
>
> ```console
> AlphanumericPasswordRequired : False
> PasswordEnabled              : True
> PasswordRecoveryEnabled      : False
> AllowSimplePassword          : True
> MinPasswordLength            : 4
> MaxPasswordFailedAttempts    : 10
> PasswordExpiration           : Unlimited
> PasswordHistory              : 0
> MinPasswordComplexCharacters : 1
> ```

## Cause

Local accounts must meet the following requirements when any password policy is set:

```console
MinPasswordLength            : 6
MinPasswordComplexCharacters : 3
```

## Resolution

This behavior is by design. The user must create a password that meets these complexity requirements.
