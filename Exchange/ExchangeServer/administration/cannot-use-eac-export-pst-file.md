# Can't use EAC to export to a PST file when the target user belongs to a child domain in Exchange Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3173182

## Symptoms

When you use the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) to export to a .pst file, and the target user account is in a separate child domain, you may receive the following error message:

> The Operation couldn't be performed because object 'username' couldn't be found on domain.corp

This issue also occurs in the command shell when you run the `New-MailboxExportRequest` cmdlet unless the `-DomainController` switch is used and explicitly provides the name of a domain controller in the child domain in which the user exists.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the Active Directory session that's responsible for searching the directory is scoped to the local domain. Because the user doesn't belong to the local domain, the user object isn't found.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use the Exchange Management Shell with the `-DomainController` switch, as in the following example:

```powershell
New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox "User One" -FilePath \\server\share\export.pst -DomainController DC1.child.domain.corp
```
