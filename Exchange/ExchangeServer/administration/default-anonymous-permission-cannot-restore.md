# Removed Default or Anonymous permission for Outlook folders can't be restored in an Exchange Server 2013 environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2983066

## Symptoms

After you remove the Default or the Anonymous permission from a Microsoft Outlook folder in an Exchange Server 2013 environment, you can't add the permissions back by running the `Add-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlet in Exchange Management Shell (EMS).

> [!NOTE]
> When you run the `Add-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlet to add the permissions back, the result indicates that the operation succeeds. Actually, when you run the `Get-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlet, the permissions are not added as expected.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, install the following cumulative update:  
[Cumulative Update 6 for Exchange Server 2013](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2961810)

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend removing the Default or the Anonymous permission from an Outlook folder.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the `Add-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlet doesn't set the Access rights parameter correctly.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem.

## More information

By default, the Anonymous and the Default accounts have the Access rights parameter set to **None** on every folder in an Exchange Server 2013 mailbox.

Here is a sample of the result when you run the `Get-MailboxFolderPermission` cmdlet for default settings in EMS:

```console
[PS] C:\>Get-MailboxFolderPermission usermbx:\inbox
FolderName User AccessRights
---------- ---- ------------
Inbox Default {None}
Inbox Anonymous {None}
```
