# Operation failed with message: Error 0x6f7 when adding a server to a database availability group in Exchange Server

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2032601

## Summary

When you add the first or an additional server to a database availability group (DAG), the error message occurs:

> A Server Side database availability group Administrative Operation failed.  
> Error the Operation failed with message: Error 0x6f7 (The Stub Received Bad Data)

## Cause

Cluster creating process checks all the valid IP addresses on network process and errors occur when invalid entry is found on the network card.

*A search for IP Addresses : __in string IPAddresses[], : IP addresses of the cluster.*

If network cards are found without default gateways on the node, the following error is logged in DAG Task logs:

> Connecting to server 'Server.Contoso.com' via WMI...  
> [Fetching the network adapters and ignoring the ones without default gateways.  
> Server.contoso.com has an address: 192.168.10.2/24 default gateway(s)=====\<none> [invalid] ---Private network  
> Server.Contoso.com has an address: 10.0.1.15/24 default gateway(s)=======\<none> [invalid] ---Public network

## Resolution

Configure one NIC in the cluster with a default gateway. Then configure static routes on the remaining NICs to help communication.

> [!NOTE]
> You should *not* have more than one default gateway on the *server* as per the following:  
> [Plan for high availability and site resilience](/Exchange/high-availability/plan-ha)
