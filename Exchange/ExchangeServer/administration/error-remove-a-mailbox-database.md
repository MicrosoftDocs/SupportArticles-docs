# Error when you try to remove a mailbox database in Exchange Server 2019 or 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3093175

## Symptoms

Even if you've already moved or disabled all users, public folders, and arbitration mailboxes, you receive one of the following error messages when running the `Remove-MailboxDatabase` cmdlet. This message states there are still mailboxes left on a Microsoft Exchange Server database.

> This mailbox database contains one or more mailboxes, mailbox plans, archive mailboxes, public folder mailboxes or
arbitration mailboxes. To get a list of all mailboxes in this database, run the command Get-Mailbox -Database **Database ID**. To get a list of all mailbox plans in this database, run the command Get-MailboxPlan. To get a list of archive mailboxes in this database, run the command Get-Mailbox -Database **Database ID** -Archive. To get a list of all public folder mailboxes in this database, run the command Get-Mailbox -Database **Database ID** -PublicFolder. To get a list of all arbitration mailboxes in this database, run the command Get-Mailbox -Database **Database ID** -Arbitration.  
> To disable a non-arbitration mailbox so that you can delete the mailbox database, run the command Disable-Mailbox **Mailbox ID**. To disable an archive mailbox so you can delete the mailbox database, run the command Disable-Mailbox **Mailbox ID** -Archive. To disable a public folder mailbox so that you can delete the mailbox database, run the command Disable-Mailbox **Mailbox ID** -PublicFolder. Arbitration mailboxes should be moved to another server; to do this, run the command New-MoveRequest **Parameters**. If this is the last server in the organization, run the command Disable-Mailbox **Mailbox ID** -Arbitration -DisableLastArbitrationMailboxAllowed to disable the arbitration mailbox.
Mailbox plans should be moved to another server; to do this, run the command Set-MailboxPlan **MailboxPlan ID**  -Database **Database ID**.

> This mailbox database contains one or more mailboxes, mailbox plans, archive mailboxes, public folder mailboxes arbitration mailboxes, or audit mailboxes. To get a list of all mailboxes in this database, run the command Get-Mailbox -Database \<Database ID>. To get a list of all mailbox plans in this database, run the command Get-MailboxPlan.

Arbitration mailboxes should be moved to another server; to do this, run the command New-MoveRequest \<parameters>.

Mailbox plans should be moved to another server; to do this, run the command Set-MailboxPlan \<MailboxPlan ID> -Database

## Cause

This issue occurs because Exchange Server 2016 and 2019 introduces an AuditLog mailbox. This mailbox may be still present and blocking removal of the database.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, use the `Get-Mailbox` cmdlet together with the `-AuditLog` parameter to determine whether the AuditLog mailbox is still present. To do this, run the following cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell:

```powershell
Get-Mailbox -AuditLog -Database <DatabaseName>
```

If the AuditLog mailbox is present, use one of the following methods:

- If it isn't the last mailbox server and database in the organization, move the mailbox to a different database by running the following cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell:

  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox -AuditLog -Database <SourceDatabaseName> | New-MoveRequest -TargetDatabase <TargetDatabaseName>
  ```

- If it's the last mailbox server and database in the organization, you can safely remove it by running the following cmdlet in the Exchange Management Shell:

  ```powershell
  Remove-Mailbox -AuditLog
  ```
