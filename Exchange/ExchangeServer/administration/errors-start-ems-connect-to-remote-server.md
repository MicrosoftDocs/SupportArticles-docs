_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4037313

## Symptoms

You may meet the following issues when you use Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Online after the [July 2017 security update KB4025333 for Windows Server](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4025333/windows-8-update-kb4025333) is installed.

### Issue 1

When you open the Exchange Management Shell, you receive the following message in the Exchange Management Shell:

> WARNING: Can't generate Export-Module for the current session using Import-PSSession.

### Issue 2

When you try to use Windows PowerShell to connect to a remote Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Online, you receive the following error message in Windows PowerShell:

> Import-PSSession: Method not found: 'System.String System.Management.Auomation.CommandMetadata.EscapeBlockComment(System.String)'
