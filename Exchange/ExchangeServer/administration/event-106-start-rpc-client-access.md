# Event ID 106 is logged when you start the RPC Client Access service on Exchange Server 2010

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;982679

## Symptoms

You start the Microsoft Exchange RPC Client Access service on a Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 server that has only the Mailbox role installed. In this situation, the following event is logged in the Application log:

```console

```

## Cause

This problem occurs because the performance counters of the RPC Client Access service aren't installed when you install only the Mailbox role on an Exchange Server 2010 server. However, this doesn't affect the functionality of the Exchange Server 2010 server.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.
