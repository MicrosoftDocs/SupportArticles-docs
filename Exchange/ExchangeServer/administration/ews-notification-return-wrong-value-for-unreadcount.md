# Exchange Web Services notification events can sometimes return an UnreadCount of -1

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4490422

## Symptoms

EWS push notifications sometimes return a value of **-1** for `UnreadCount`.

## Status

Microsoft is currently investigating this issue.

## Workaround

To work around this limitation, use a [GetFolder](/exchange/client-developer/web-service-reference/getfolder) request and include [PR_UNREAD_COUNT](/office/client-developer/outlook/mapi/pidtagcontentunreadcount-canonical-property) in the requested set of properties.

To include the `PR_UNREAD_COUNT` property, set the property tag to `PropertyTag="0x3603"` and the property type to `PropertyType="Integer"`.

\<ExtendedFieldURI PropertyTag="0x3603" PropertyType=" Integer"/>  

If you're using the EWS Managed API or EWS Java API, use the [ExtendedPropertyDefinition](/dotnet/api/microsoft.exchange.webservices.data.extendedpropertydefinition) class to request the `PR_UNREAD_COUNT` property.
