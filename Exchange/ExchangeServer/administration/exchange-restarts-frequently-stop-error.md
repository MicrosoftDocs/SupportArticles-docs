# Responder ServiceHealthMSExchangeReplForceReboot causes Exchange Server to restart with Stop Error

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2969070

## Symptoms

Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 restarts frequently and displays the following Stop error on a blue screen.

> bugcheck  
Bugcheck code 000000EF  
Arguments fffffa80`1a5f9980 00000000`00000000 00000000`00000000 00000000`00000000

The restarts are initiated by the Managed Availability responder `ServiceHealthMSExchangeReplForceReboot`.

The recovery action event is observed in RecoveryActionResults:

## Cause

Misconfigured network adapter on Exchange Server causes failure in Domain Name System (DNS) name resolution.

## Resolution

Make sure that the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** property is selected on the network adapter:

> [!NOTE]
> For Exchange server that is a member of DAG and has separate MAPI and Replication network adapters, make sure that this property is selected on the network adapter that represents the MAPI network.

Review the guidelines provided in the following article and make sure that the network adapter that represents the MAPI and Replication networks are configured accordingly.

## More information

Use the following PowerShell command on the affected Exchange server to ensure the server restarts are indeed caused by the `ServiceHealthMSExchangeReplForceReboot` responder.

```powershell
Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Exchange-ManagedAvailability/* | where {$_.Message -like "*ServiceHealthMSExchangeReplForceReboot*"} | ft Message,TimeCreated
```

Or, you can search the crimson channel log named *Recovery Action Logs* and *Remote Action Logs* for word *ForceReboot* to find the responder that causes the restart.
