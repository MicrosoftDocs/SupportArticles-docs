# Event 7031 when you run Exchange maintenance scripts or Set-ServerComponentState

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;4043629

## Symptoms

The Microsoft Exchange Frontend Transport service crashes when you do one of the following things:

- Run the `Set-ServerComponentState` cmdlet against the `ServerWideOffline` component.
- Run [Exchange 2013 DAG Maintenance scripts](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Exchange-2013-DAG-3ac89826).

This problem occurs in the following products:

- Microsoft Exchange Server 2016
- Exchange Server 2013 with cumulative update (CU) 6 or a later CU

When the problem occurs, event 7031 is logged:

```console
Log Name: System  
Source: Service Control Manager  
Description:  
The Microsoft Exchange Frontend Transport service terminated unexpectedly. It has done this 1 time(s). The following corrective action will be taken in 5000 milliseconds: Restart the service.
```

## Set-ServerComponentState examples that end the Frontend Transport service

- `Set-ServerComponentState -Identity <ServerName> -Component ServerWideOffline -State Inactive -Requester Maintenance`

- `Set-ServerComponentState -Identity <ServerName> -Component ServerWideOffline -State Active -Requester Maintenance`

- `Set-ServerComponentState -Identity <ServerName> -Component ServerWideOffline -State Inactive -Requester Functional`

The first two commands are included in the [Exchange 2013 DAG Maintenance scripts](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/office/Exchange-2013-DAG-3ac89826). So you meet this problem when you run the scripts.

## Resolution

This issue is by design, because of code changes in Exchange Server 2016 and Exchange Server 2013 starting with CU6.
