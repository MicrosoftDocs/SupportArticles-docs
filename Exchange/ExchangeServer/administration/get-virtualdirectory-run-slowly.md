# Get-VirtualDirectory cmdlets take a long time to run in Exchange Server

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2896472

## Symptoms

In an Exchange Server environment, you run one of the following cmdlets to obtain the properties of a virtual directory for a server in another site that's connected over a wide area network (WAN):

- Get-WebServicesVirtualDirectory
- Get-OwaVirtualDirectory
- Get-ActiveSyncVirtualDirectory
- Get-AutodiscoverVirtualDirectory
- Get-EcpVirtualDirectory
- Get-PowerShellVirtualDirectory
- Get-OABvirtualDirectory

However, the cmdlet takes much longer than expected to run (about 15 minutes).

## Cause

This issue occurs because the cmdlet makes calls to the Internet Information Services (IIS) metabase for the properties of the virtual directory.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use the `AdPropertiesOnly` switch with the cmdlet in the calls to the IIS metabase.

Example 1

```powershell
Get-OwaVirtualDirectory -Server Contoso -AdpropertiesOnly
```

Example 2

```powershell
Get-OwaVirtualDirectory -Identity "Contoso\owa (default Web site)" -AdpropertiesOnly
```

The `ADPropertiesOnly` switch specifies that only the virtual directory properties that are stored in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) are returned.

For more information about `ADPropertiesOnly` switch, see [Get-OwaVirtualDirectory](/powershell/module/exchange/get-owavirtualdirectory).
