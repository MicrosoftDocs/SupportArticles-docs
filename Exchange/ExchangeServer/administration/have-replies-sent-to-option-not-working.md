# The Have replies sent to option does not work when your mailbox has server autoreply configured

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2911210

## Symptoms

Assume that you create a server-side rule in Exchange Server 2010. The rule is configured to have replies to a certain account sent to another account by using the **Have replies sent to** option. In this situation, the recipient that you specified in the **Have replies sent to** option is not automatically added in the **To** line when the sender tries to reply to the automated reply.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the email message does not contain the `PR_REPLY_RECIPIENT_NAMES` property.
