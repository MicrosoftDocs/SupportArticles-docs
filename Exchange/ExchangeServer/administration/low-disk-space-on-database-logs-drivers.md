## Symptoms

In a Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 environment, a Mailbox database may exhibit the following behavior:

- Mail delivery to the database may be stopped.
- The database may become unmounted and cannot be mounted.
- Inability to move files to the same location as the database or log files associate with the database.
- Inability to move mailboxes to the database.

## Cause

Low disk space on database or database log volume.

## Resolution

If you encounter low disk space issues, you can perform the following actions to correct the issue:

- Delete content from mailboxes or public folders.
- Purge items from the Recoverable Items folder.
- Run database maintenance.
