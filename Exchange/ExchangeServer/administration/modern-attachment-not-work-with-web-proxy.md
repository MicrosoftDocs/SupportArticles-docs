# The modern attachment feature doesn't work when web proxy used in Exchange Server 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4056953

## Symptoms

After you set the `InternetWebProxy` property by using the `Set-ExchangeServer` cmdlet in Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, the [modern attachment feature](/exchange/hybrid-deployment/set-up-document-collaboration) doesn't work. An event like the following is logged on the Exchange Server:

> **Log Name:** Application  
> **Source:** MSExchange OWA  
> **Date:** \<Date>  
> **Event ID:** 164  
> **Task Category:** Configuration  
> **Level:** Error  
> **Keywords:** Classic  
> **User:** N/A  
> **Computer:** server.contoso.com  
> **Description:** There was a failure in finding the SharePoint endpoint. The document library and endpoint location couldn't be retrieved using "https://contoso123.sharepoint.com". System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server The document library and endpoint location couldn't be retrieved using "https://contoso123.sharepoint.com". System.Net.WebException: Unable to connect to the remote server

## Cause

OAuth authentication is used between Exchange Server 2016 and the web location (such as OneDrive) that stores the attachment. The `InternetWebProxy` property isn't supported by OAuth authentication.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Locate and open each web.config file for the virtual directories: OWA, Mapi, EWS.
1. Look for the proxy part of the web.config file, such as the following:

    ```xml
    <system.net>
        <defaultProxy>
            <proxy usesystemdefault="true" bypassonlocal="true" />
            <bypasslist>
    ```

1. Add the proxy server with a port number, such as `http://proxy.contoso.com:8080`, and set the necessary bypass list:

    ```xml
    <system.net>
        <defaultProxy>
            <proxy usesystemdefault="false" bypassonlocal="true" proxyaddress="http://proxy.contoso.com:8080" />
            <bypasslist>
                <add address=".*\.contoso\.com" />
            </bypasslist>
        </defaultProxy>
    </system.net>
    ```
