# Notes field in Contacts is blank after it is updated on a mobile device or in Outlook Web App

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2980834

## Symptoms

After an Exchange Server 2013 mailbox user updates the Notes field of a contact in the Contacts section on a mobile device or in Outlook Web App, the note seems to be blank in a Microsoft Outlook client that is running in Online Mode. This issue occurs in Exchange Server 2013 Service Pack 1 or Cumulative Update 5.

## Cause

This is a known issue that will be fixed in a future update of Exchange Server 2013.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, you can set the Outlook client to run in Cached Exchange Mode. For more information, see [Turn on Cached Exchange Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/office/turn-on-cached-exchange-mode-7885af08-9a60-4ec3-850a-e221c1ed0c1c).
