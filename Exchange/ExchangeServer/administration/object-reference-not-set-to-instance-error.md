# Object reference not set to an instance of an object error and message trace fails in an Exchange hybrid environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4481099

## Symptoms

Considering this scenario:

- You're working in a Microsoft Exchange Server hybrid environment.
- A message is sent from an on-premises mailbox to an Exchange Online mailbox.
- You try to trace the message in Delivery Reports in the on-premises Exchange organization.

In this scenario, the trace fails, and you receive this error message:

> Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

## Cause

This is by design. Exchange Server does not support tracing a message that's sent from on-premises to the cloud in a hybrid environment.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, run the message trace from Microsoft 365 to get a partial trace on the cloud side. Be aware that this does not show the on-premises path.
