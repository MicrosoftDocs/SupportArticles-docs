# Outlook Voice Access (OVA) is not available when you call from a shared mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3078440

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- A user accesses a shared mailbox (Mailbox_999).
- The phone extension for Mailbox_999 is ext. 12345.
- The user dials the Subscriber Access number from phone ext. 12345 and then enters the extension and PIN.

In this scenario, the Unified Messaging (UM) server responds with an **Invalid Mailbox Extension** error message.

## Workaround

Users can still use Outlook Voice Access (OVA) to access a shared mailbox. However, they must call from an extension of a non-shared mailbox. To work around this issue, the user must dial the Subscriber Access number from a different phone extension, such as ext. 78900. Then, enter ext. 12345 and the correct PIN. OVA can now successfully access Mailbox_999.
