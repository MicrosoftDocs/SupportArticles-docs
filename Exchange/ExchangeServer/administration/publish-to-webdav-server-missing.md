# The Publish to WebDAV Server option is missing from the Calendar folder shortcut menu

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3034267

## Symptoms

When you try to share a Calendar folder in an Exchange mailbox or an Exchange Online mailbox, the **Publish to WebDAV Server** option is missing.

The following screenshot shows the option that you expect to see on the menu when you right-click **Calendar** and then point to **Share**.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue doesn't occur if you try to share a calendar that's not located in the mailbox. For example, if you try to share a Calendar folder from your local personal folders file (.pst), the **Publish to WebDAV Server** option is available.

## Cause

This issue occurs if both the following conditions are true:

- The sharing policy that's set for the Exchange organization or the mailbox has the Anonymous domain specified in the Domains parameter.
- You try to publish a Calendar folder in an Exchange mailbox or an Exchange Online mailbox. For example, the following Exchange PowerShell command and results shows a default sharing policy that uses this configuration.

Command:

```powershell
Get-SharingPolicy | FL domains
```

Results:

```console
Domains : {Anonymous:CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple}
```

## Resolution

In this configuration, share the Exchange calendar folder together with users in domains that are allowed by the Exchange administrator. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the Calendar folder, select **Share**, and then select **Publish This Calendar**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - If you're prompted to do this, enter your credentials.
    > - Your default browser opens, and the **Calendar Publishing - Calendar** page is displayed.
    >

2. Set the publishing options for your calendar, and then select **Start publishing**.

3. Note the URLs that are provided in the link for subscribing to this calendar and for viewing the calendar in a web browser.

    These are the links that you share together with other users who view your calendar.

4. To stop publishing your calendar, select **stop publishing**.
