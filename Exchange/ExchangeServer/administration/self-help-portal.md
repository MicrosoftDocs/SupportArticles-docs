# Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help diagnostic portal

## Summary

### Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help

The "Fix it Center Pro" name and its associated portal were retired and are replaced by the Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help portal. The new portal is an automated troubleshooting service from Microsoft. This service can help make it easier to identify solutions to problems with Microsoft applications. Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help uses targeted analysis to scan your system to identify and resolve specific problem areas. The analysis sessions scan your system to identify solutions for specific problem areas. The results are uploaded to Microsoft servers to be processed and to identify any known issues. If a known issue is found, a message is displayed that explains the steps that you can take to resolve the problem.

### Diagnostic results

If the diagnostic does not resolve your issue, you can go to [Online Assisted Support](https://support.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/productselection) and initiate a request to have a Microsoft technical support representative contact you. In this case, charges may apply.

### How to return to Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help

Diagnostic results are usually displayed immediately after the troubleshooter completes its scan. However, it can sometimes take up to an hour for deep analytics to be completed. Your computer will not be affected by these deep analytics because the analysis is processed in Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help. You can leave Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help and then return to the site later to review the diagnostic results. 

To return to Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help, follow these steps: 

1. Click the following link:

    [Microsoft Diagnostics Services—Self-Help](https://home.diagnostics.support.microsoft.com/selfhelp)

2. If you are prompted, sign in by using your Windows Live ID.    
3. To view your Analysis Package, click **Recent Sessions** at the top of the page, and then locate the name that you entered earlier.
