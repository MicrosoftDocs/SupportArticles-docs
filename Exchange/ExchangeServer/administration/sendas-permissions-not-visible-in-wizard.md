# SendAs permissions granted to users in forests are not visible in Send As Permission Wizard in EMC

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2401524

## Symptoms

The Send As permissions that are granted to users in forests trusted by Exchange Server forest aren't visible in the Send As Permission Wizard in Exchange Management Console (EMC).

## Cause

It is the current design in Exchange Server 2010.

## Workaround

To view all accounts that have SendAs rights on a mailbox, you can use the following PowerShell command instead:

```powershell
Get-ADPermission <mailboxname> | where {($_.extendedrights -like "*send-as*") -or ($_.accessrights -like "*Generical*")} |fl *
```

For more information, see [Manage Send As Permissions for a Mailbox](/previous-versions/office/exchange-server-2010/bb676368(v=exchg.141)).
