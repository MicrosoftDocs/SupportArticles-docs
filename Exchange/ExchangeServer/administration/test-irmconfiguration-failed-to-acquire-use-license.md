When configuring Active Directory Rights Management Service (AD-RMS) with Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, you may receive the following failure when you run `Test-IRMConfiguration` in the Exchange Management Shell (EMS).

 - FAIL: Failed to acquire a use license. This failure may cause features such as Transport Decryption, Jo

 "FederatedEmail.4c1f4d8b-8179-4148-93bf-00a95fa1e042" representing the Exchange Servers Group is granted sup
 er user privileges on the Active Directory Rights Management Services server. For detailed instructions, see
 "Add the Federated Delivery Mailbox to the AD RMS Super Users Group" at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=193400.
```

## Cause

This problem can occur if the FederatedEmail.4c1f4d8b-8179-4148-93bf-00a95fa1e042 had been deleted and recreated. After reconfiguring the AD-RMS Super Users Group, the above error will still occur.

## Resolution

On Exchange server, follow these steps:

1. Turn off IRM.

    ```powershell
    Set-IRMConfiguration -InternalLicensingEnabled $false
    ```

1. Backup and delete the directories in `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\DRM\Server`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Server folder is a hidden system folder and you will need to unselect the **Hide protected operating system files** to view the folder.

1. Reboot.
1. Enable IRM.

    ```powershell
    Set-IRMConfiguration -InternalLicensingEnabled $true
    ```

1. Test IRM.

    ```powershell
    Test-IRMConfiguration -sender [user@domain.com]
    ```

## More information

Exchange will use the old GIC from the deleted FederatedEmail account. After you remove the files under the Server folder, the new GIC will only contain the Exchange servers local system account.

The Exchange server must be rebooted for the new GIC to with the FederatedEmail account to work correctly.
