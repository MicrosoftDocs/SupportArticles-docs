# Attendees receive a meeting update after the event reminder is triggered

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3108249

## Symptoms  

After the reminder for an event is triggered, attendees receive a meeting update without any changes. Additionally, attendees receive a meeting request in their Inbox that includes the **No Response Required** option.

## Cause

The organizer of the meeting performed an action on the iOS 9.x device that sent a change for the appointment to Exchange. A new behavior was introduced in version 16 of the Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) protocol in which Exchange sends meeting updates when an EAS client sends a change for the appointment.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this issue and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available. Customers who experience this issue should contact Apple for help.

## Workaround

You can work around this issue by using [Microsoft Outlook for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook/id951937596?mt=8).
