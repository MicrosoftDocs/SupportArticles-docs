# Users can't access their archive mailbox in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3098940

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- The MAPI/HTTP protocol is disabled in an Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 organization.
- The MAPI/HTTP protocol is enabled at the mailbox level for one or more users.

In this scenario, users who have MAPI/HTTP enabled can't access their archive mailbox in Outlook.

> [!NOTE]
> The issue may occur even after the MAPI/HTTP protocol is enabled for the organization.

## Cause

This issue occurs because Exchange Server returns RPC/HTTP information for a MAPI/HTTP autodiscover request when the MAPI/HTTP protocol is disabled in the Exchange organization.

## Workaround - Method 1

Use Microsoft Outlook Web App or Microsoft Outlook on the web instead of using Outlook.

## Workaround - Method 2

Disable the MAPI/HTTP protocol for the affected users by running the [Set-CASMailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/set-casmailbox) cmdlet as follows:

```powershell
Set-CASMailbox <Alias> -MapiHttpEnabled $False
```

## Workaround - Method 3

Enable the MAPI/HTTP protocol for the organization by running the [Set-OrganizationConfig](/powershell/module/exchange/set-organizationconfig) cmdlet as follows:

```powershell
Set-OrganizationConfig -MapiHttpEnabled $True
```
