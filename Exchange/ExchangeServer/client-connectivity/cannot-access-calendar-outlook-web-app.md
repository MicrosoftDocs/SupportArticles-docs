# Can't access the calendar in Outlook Web App in an Exchange Server environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2780262

## Symptoms

When users try to access the calendar in Outlook Web App in an Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, or Exchange Server 2016 environment, the users receive the following error message:

> The item you tried to access no longer exists.  
> The item wasn't found. You or a delegate might have moved or deleted it using another computer or a mobile phone.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue affects all users in the environment.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the default calendar sharing policy is missing.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

- Run the following command to create a new calendar sharing policy:

    ```powershell
    New-SharingPolicy "Default Sharing Policy" -Enabled $true -Domains *:CalendarSharingFreeBusySimple -Default $true
    ```

- Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager, and then recycle the MSExchangeOWAAppPool and MSExchangeOWACalendarAppPool application pools.
