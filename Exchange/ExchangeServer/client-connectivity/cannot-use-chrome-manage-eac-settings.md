# You can't use Chrome to manage settings in the EAC in an Exchange Server 2013 environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2769335

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You install Xunlei Thunder on a computer in a Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 environment.
- You use Google Chrome to go to the Microsoft website and access the Exchange Administration Center (EAC): `https://exchangeserver/ecp`.

- You select an option in the EAC.

In this scenario, you receive the following error message:

> The Web page isn't loading properly. Please reload the page by refreshing your Web browser.

## Cause

This issue occurs because of a conflict between the EAC and the Thunder extension in Chrome.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, open the extension settings menu in Chrome, and then disable the Thunder extension.
