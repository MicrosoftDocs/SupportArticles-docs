# Email message content is missing in OWA

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You access a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox by using Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA).
- You send an email message by using OWA.
- The recipient tries to read the email message by using Mozilla Firefox.

In this scenario, some email message content may be missing.

## Cause

This issue can occur if the following conditions are true:

- The email message contains deeply nested elements.
- The Use Conversations view in OWA is turned on.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, turn off the Use Conversations view in OWA. To do this, select **View** and then clear **Use Conversations**.
