However, when you try to access Exchange Control Panel (ECP) or Outlook Web App (OWA), you receive the following error message:

    * SharedWebConfig.config is missing from either of these locations:
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy
      C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\ClientAccess
```

## Cause

This issue occurs if SharedWebConfig.config is missing from either of the following locations:

- C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy
- C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\ClientAccess

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the server that's facing the problem, identify the location that the file is missing from.
1. Generate the missing file:

    1. Run `cd %ExchangeInstallPath%\bin` to change the current directory to the bin folder that's under the Exchange installation path.
    1. Use the DependentAssemblyGenerator.exe tool to generate the file:

        - If the file is missing from *C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\ClientAccess*, run the following command:

        ```console
        DependentAssemblyGenerator.exe -exchangePath "%ExchangeInstallPath%\bin" -exchangePath "%ExchangeInstallPath%\ClientAccess" -configFile "%ExchangeInstallPath%\ClientAccess\SharedWebConfig.config"
        ```

        - If the file is missing from *C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy*, run the following command:

        ```console
        DependentAssemblyGenerator.exe -exchangePath "%ExchangeInstallPath%\bin" -exchangePath "%ExchangeInstallPath%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy" -configFile "%ExchangeInstallPath%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\SharedWebConfig.config"
        ```

1. Run IISRESET, or restart the server.

## More information

The *SharedWebConfig.config* file generates during the post-installation phase of Setup. If Setup resumes after an interruption, it doesn't do the post-installation steps for the roles that were successfully installed before the interruption.
