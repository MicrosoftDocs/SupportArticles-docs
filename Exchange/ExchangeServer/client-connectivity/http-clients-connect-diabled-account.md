# HTTP clients can still connect to Exchange after account is disabled or password is changed

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3035228

## Symptoms

An HTTP client such as Exchange ActiveSync (EAS), Outlook Anywhere, or Exchange Web Services (EWS) may still be able to connect to its mailbox after its account has been disabled. Clients may also be able to connect by using an old password after the password has been changed.

## Cause

When you're using Basic authentication and Forms-based Authentication (FBA), Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) caches the user's token so that Windows logon occurs only during the initial logon or after the token has been flushed. (This flushing occurs when the TTL [default setting of 15 minutes] for the token expires.) If the user reconnects before the TTL has expired, the TTL will be reset. It may require 8-24 hours before the changes are recognized.

To clear the token cache and to force the client to authenticate, use one of the following methods.

## Resolution 1: Reset IIS

1. On the Client Access server or servers that the device connects to, click **Start**, click **Run**, type *CMD*, and then press ENTER.
2. Type *iisreset*, and then press ENTER. This restarts IIS services. You can also use the Services.msc snap-in to manually restart the IIS Admin service.

## Resolution 2: Recycle the App pools

1. Click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
2. Expand the server name.
3. Click **Application Pools**.
4. Right-click **MSExchangeSyncAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.
5. Right-click **MSExchangeServicesAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.
6. Right-click **MSExchangeOWAAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.
7. Right-click **DefaultAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**. (Exchange 2010 and Exchange 2007 only)
8. Right-click **MSExchangeRPCProxyFrontEndAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.
9. Right-click **MSExchangeMAPIFrontEndAppPool**, and then click **Recycle**.
