# Meetings are off by one hour in certain time zones

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3171495

## Symptoms

When an organizer creates a meeting from an iOS device, the attendees receive a meeting request that is one hour earlier than the scheduled meeting time.

## Cause

The meeting request sent from Exchange to the attendees has an incorrect start time and time zone information. The following is the tine zone information from the meeting request:

```console
This timezone is 180 minutes (3 hours) ahead of UTC.
Its primary / standard time name is "".
The timezone transitions from daylight savings time to standard time 10/26/2016 2:00:00 AM.
During standard time, time is 180 minutes (3 hours) ahead of UTC.
Its daylight time name is "".
The timezone transitions from standard time to daylight savings time 3/5/2016 2:00:00 AM.
During daylight savings time, time is 240 minutes (4 hours) ahead of UTC.

```

## Workaround

Modify the time zone on the EAS client to another region with the same time offset until the DST period ends.
