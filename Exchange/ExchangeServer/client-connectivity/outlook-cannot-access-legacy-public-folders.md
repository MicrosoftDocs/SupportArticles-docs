# Outlook can't access public folders hosted on legacy Exchange servers

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3177600

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- In your Microsoft Exchange environment, Exchange Server 2010 coexists with either Exchange Server 2013 or Exchange Server 2016.
- Public folders are hosted on the Exchange 2010 servers.
- Access to the legacy public folders has been configured according to the guidelines in [Configure legacy public folders where user mailboxes are on Exchange 2013 servers](/exchange/configure-legacy-public-folders-where-user-mailboxes-are-on-exchange-2013-servers-exchange-2013-help).
- There are multiple Exchange 2010 public folder databases.

In this scenario, users who have an Exchange 2013-based or Exchange 2016-based mailbox can't access public folders by using Microsoft Outlook.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the mailbox database that hosts the user's mailbox is configured for a public folder database that differs from the public folder discovery mailbox database.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, configure the user's mailbox database to use the same public folder database as the discovery mailbox:

1. Assign a public folder discovery mailbox to the user's mailbox by using the `Set-Mailbox` cmdlet, as follows:

    ```powershell
    Set-Mailbox <User> -DefaultPublicFolderMailbox <ProxyMailbox>
    ```

1. Assign the public folder database for the user's mailbox database by using the `Set-MailboxDatabase` cmdlet, as follows:

    ```powershell
    Set-MailboxDatabase (Get-Mailbox <User>).Database -PublicFolderDatabase (Get-MailboxDatabase (Get-Mailbox <ProxyMailbox>).Database).PublicFolderDatabase
    ```

1. Run the following cmdlet to restart the Microsoft Exchange Rpc Client Access service on the server that's running Exchange Server that hosts the public folders:

    ```powershell
    Restart-Service MSExchangeRPC
    ```
