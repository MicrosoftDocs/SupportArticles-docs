# OWA password expiration notification when you use fine-grained password policy

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3141296

## Symptoms

In Outlook on the web or Outlook Web App (OWA), the password expiration notification window is displayed when a user tries to log on to their mailbox. However, the fine-grained password policy shows that the user's password is not expired.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the user is assigned a fine-grained password policy where the maximum password age is longer than the maximum password age in the default domain policy.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Disable the fine-grained password policy for all users.
- Disable the OWA password change feature from Exchange Server.
- Change the **Maximum Password Age** value for the Default Domain Policy setting so that it's larger than the value in the fine-grained password policy.
