# Repair update messages are triggered by TimeZoneMatchCheck failures in Exchange Server

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3019798

## Symptoms

In Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2013, or Exchange Server 2010, you receive one or more repair update messages on an iOS 8.*x* or iOS 7.*x* device. These messages indicate that the Calendar Repair Assistant (CRA) has updated a meeting.

The body of the message contains the following:

```console
Your meeting was found to be out of date and has been automatically updated.

Updated meeting details:
Meeting Recurrence
```

Analysis of the CRA logs shows that the TimeZoneMatchCheck process failed:

## Cause

Meeting repair update messages may appear in the attendee's Inbox 12-48 hours after the attendee updated the meeting on an iOS 8.*x* or iOS 7.*x* device. CRA is trying to correct a discrepancy that was introduced by the iOS device to the time zone property of the attendee's copy of the meeting.

## Resolution

This issue has been addressed in the iOS 8.3 update.
