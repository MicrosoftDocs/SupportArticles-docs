# Test-OwaConnectivity and Test-EcpConnectivity cmdlet tests fail in external mode

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2814954

## Symptoms

When you have an Exchange Server 2013 server that is running a Client Access server, the server functions much like a front door. It admits all client requests and routs them to the correct active Mailbox database in a group of Client Access servers that are running Exchange Server 2010.

When you run the `Test-OwaConnectivity` and `Test-EcpConnectivity` cmdlets in external mode on the Exchange Server 2010 Client Access server, the cmdlets try to test the Exchange Server 2013 server first. However, the cmdlet tests fail.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the `Test-OwaConnectivity` and `Test-EcpConnectivity` cmdlets in external mode cannot sign in successfully to the Exchange Server 2013 server.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, run the `Test-OwaConnectivity` and `Test-EcpConnectivity` cmdlets in internal mode on the Exchange Server 2010 Client Access server.
