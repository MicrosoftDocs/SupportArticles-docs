# Error when you perform a multi-mailbox search in Exchange Server 2010: The user does not have an exchange mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2702446

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You start the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Enterprise or in Exchange Server 2010 Standard.
- You do a multi-mailbox search.
- The multi-mailbox search uses a System mailbox, the Discovery Search mailbox, or the Federated mailbox as the target for the search.

In this scenario, you may get the following error message:

> The user does not have an exchange mailbox

Additionally, the following event is logged in the Application log:

```

## Cause

This issue can occur if one or more of the following mailboxes are in an inconsistent state because no value is set for the `HomeMDB` attribute:

- One or more System mailboxes
- The Federated mailbox
- The Discovery Search mailbox

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Start the ECP.
1. Verify that one or more mailboxes are in an inconsistent state. To do this, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
    Get-Mailbox -Arbitration |fl name, alias
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may receive an error message that resembles the following. This error message confirms that one or more System mailboxes or the Federated mailbox is in an inconsistent state:
    >
    > WARNING: The object SystemMailbox{1f05a927-9daf-4003-9bf7-036822f96290} has been corrupted, and it's  
    in an inconsistent state. The following validation errors happened:  
    WARNING: Database is mandatory on UserMailbox.  
    WARNING: Database is mandatory on UserMailbox.

1. Verify that the value for the `HomeMDB` attribute is missing for a mailbox. To do this, type the following cmdlet in the ECP, and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
        Get-Mailbox |fl name, alias
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The following error message indicates that the value for the `HomeMDB` attribute is missing:  
    > Database is mandatory on UserMailbox

1. Copy the `HomeMDB` attribute value for a mailbox in the same database as the System mailbox, the Federated mailbox, or the Discovery Search mailbox. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. Click **Start**, type *Adsi Edit* in the **Search programs and files** box, and then press Enter.
    1. On the **Action** menu, click **Connect to**.
    1. Click **Select or type a domain or server**, select the server that you want, and then click **OK**.
    1. Expand **Default naming context**, and then click the following item:

        **DC=domain,DC=com**
    1. Double-click **CN=Users**.
    1. Right-click a user mailbox, and then click **Properties**.
    1. Under **Attribute**, click **homeMDB** > **Edit**.
    1. Copy the value for the `HomeMDB` attribute, and then click **OK** two times.
1. Set the `HomeMDB` attribute value on the System mailbox, the Federated mailbox, or the Discovery Search mailbox account. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. In ADSI Edit, right-click the account for the System mailbox, the Federated mailbox, or the Discovery Search mailbox, and then click **Properties**.
    1. Under **Attribute**, click **homeMDB** > **Edit**.
    1. Type or paste the `HomeMDB` attribute value that you copied in step 4.
    1. Click **OK** two times.
1. On the **File** menu, click **Exit**.
1. Replicate the forest. To do this, type the following cmdlet at an elevated command prompt, and then press Enter:

    ```console
    repadmin /syncall /e
    ```
