# Search-AdminAuditLog and Search-MailboxAuditLog with parameter return empty results

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;3054391

## Symptoms

When you run the [Search-AdminAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-adminauditlog) or [Search-MailboxAuditLog](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailboxauditlog) cmdlets in Exchange Management Shell together with a **Cmdlets** or **Parameters** parameter to filter the results, an empty or incomplete result set is returned. Even if you run the `Search-AdminAuditLog` cmdlet without parameters, the full results might not be returned as expected.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, install the following Cumulative Updates (CUs) as appropriate:

[Cumulative Update 12 for Exchange Server 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5011156) or [a later cumulative update](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates?view=exchserver-20190) for Exchange Server 2019

[Cumulative Update 23 for Exchange Server 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5011155) or [a later cumulative update](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates?view=exchserver-2016) for Exchange Server 2016

## Workaround

You might be able to work around this issue depending on the language settings on the server where the searched mailbox is located (active copy of database containing the mailbox you are running search for). On the server, open the **Welcome screen and new user accounts settings** dialog box in the **Region** settings and check the **Format** setting for **Welcome screen**. If **Format** is not set to **English (United States)**, follow these steps to set the language and regional settings for the system and network service accounts:

1. Set English (United States) as the primary language.
    1. In **Control Panel**, open the **Language** item.
    1. Add the language of **English (United States)**.
    1. Select **Options** for the added language.
    1. Select **Download and install language pack** if this option is available.
    1. Select **Make this the primary language**.
1. Copy the regional settings.
    1. In **Control Panel**, open the **Region** item.
    1. Select **English (United States)** in the **Format** list.
    1. Open the **Administrative** tab, and select **Copy settings**.
    1. In the **Welcome screen and new user accounts settings** dialog box, select **Welcome screen and system accounts**, and then select **OK**.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > - The system accounts include the network service account.
        > - You can revert the **Format** setting for **Current user** to the original value as long as **Format** for **Welcome screen** is set to **English (United States)**.
