# Developing apps by using Exchange 2010 PowerShell and the .NET Framework

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2827611

Assume that you want to use any Microsoft .NET language to develop applications that automate Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 cmdlets. Remote PowerShell is the supported and recommended method for doing this.

## More information

Microsoft does not support manually loading the Exchange PowerShell snap-in by using the `RunspaceConfiguration.AddPSSnapIn()` API. The Exchange PowerShell snap-in is the supported method for building applications in Exchange Server 2007. However, this method is not supported or recommended for use with Exchange Server 2010 cmdlets.
