# Error when adding a large attachment in Outlook on the web

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2957856

## Symptoms

Users who are connected to a mailbox by using Outlook on the web (formally known as Outlook Web App or OWA) can't add an attachment to an email message. Additionally, the users receive one of the following error messages:

> The following files couldn't be attached: Filename. Please try again later.

> The following files weren't attached because adding them would cause the message to exceed the maximum size limit of 10 MB: filename.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the attachment exceeds the message size limit. The default maximum message size for an attachment is 10 megabytes (MB).

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Increase the maximum message size for the organization by using the `Set-TransportConfig` cmdlet.
2. Increase the maximum message size for the Send connectors by using the `Set-SendConnector` cmdlet.
3. Increase the maximum message size for the Receive connectors by using the `Set-ReceiveConnector` cmdlet.
4. Increase the following settings in the OWA Web.config file:
   - **maxAllowedContentLength** (value in bytes)
   - **maxReceivedMessageSize** (value in bytes)
   - **maxStringContentLength** (value in bytes)
   - **maxRequestLength** (value in kilobytes)
5. Increase the following settings in the EWS web.config file:
   - **maxAllowedContentLength** (value in bytes)
   - **maxReceivedMessageSize** (value in bytes)
6. Stop and then restart the **MSExchangeOWAAppPool** application pool.
7. Stop and then restart the **MSExchangeServicesAppPool** application pool.
8. Restart IIS on the Exchange server by using either of the following methods:

   - Open IIS Manager, select the server, and in the **Actions** pane, click **Restart**.

   - Run the following commands from an elevated command prompt (a Command Prompt window you open by selecting **Run as administrator**):

     ```console
     net stop w3svc /y
     ```

     ```console
     net start w3svc
     ```

> [!NOTE]
> Steps 3-6 must be performed in both of the following locations:
>
> - The Client Access server on which the Web.config files are located under *%ExchangeInstallPath%\FrontEnd\HttpProxy*.
> - The Mailbox server on which the Web.config files are located under *%ExchangeInstallPath%\ClientAccess*.
