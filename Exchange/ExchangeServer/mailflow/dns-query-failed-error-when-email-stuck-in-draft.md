# DNS query failed error when an email message is stuck in the Draft folder in Exchange Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3007623

## Symptoms

Assume that you have a computer that is a member of an Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 environment. You do not have the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** check box selected on the DNS tab of the **Advanced TCP/IP Settings** dialog box of TCP/IPv4. In this situation, email messages remain stuck in the Drafts folder.

Additionally, when you check the transport queue, you see an error message that resembles the following:

> 4.4.0 DNS query failed. The error was: DNS query failed with error ErrorRetry.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the DNS service cannot be used if the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** check box is not selected in an Exchange Server 2016 or Exchange Server 2013 environment.

## Resolution - Method 1: Select the Register this connection's addresses in DNS check box

On your computer, select the **Register this connection's addresses in DNS** check box on the **DNS** tab of the **Advanced TCP/IP Settings** dialog box of TCP/IPv4.

## Resolution - Method 2: Enable the DNS service by using a registry key
