# Emails are placed in the Poison queue

## Symptoms

Email messages that should be sent or received are placed in the Poison queue in the Exchange Server that has the Transport Rule Agent enabled. If you disable the Transport Rule Agent and [resubmit or retry the messages in the Poison queue](/exchange/mail-flow/queues/queue-procedures#resubmit-messages-in-the-poison-message-queue), the messages are removed from the queue and moved to their destination. However, the issue reoccurs after you re-enable the Transport Rule Agent.

### Errors in Event Viewer

When you check events in Event Viewer, you see the following error message:

> Transport engine failed to evaluate condition due to Filtering Service error…FIPS test Extraction file with error 'Scanning Process caught exception: … Unknown Error 2214608899. Unable to reserve MSAM for file parsing – the engine is permanently offline.'

The detailed events resemble the following. All the events detailed below are related, and events 4010, 4999, and 2203 are particularly relevant.

```output

```

### Errors in the message tracking log

When you search the [message tracking](/exchange/mail-flow/transport-logs/message-tracking) log, you see FAIL event IDs that have the following LastError:

> LastError: DSN 5.3.0 Too many related errors

## Cause

This issue occurs because files are missing in the *:::no-loc text="%ExchangeInstallPath%FIP-FS\Data\Engines\amd64":::* folder. If that's the case, when the FIP-FS engine tries to scan email messages and categorize them, it generates the event errors described in the Symptoms section and places email messages in the Poison queue.

## Resolution

Verify that the appropriate files are present in the *:::no-loc text="%ExchangeInstallPath%FIP-FS\Data\Engines\amd64":::* folder. You must first copy the files in the *:::no-loc text="%ExchangeInstallPath%FIP-FS\Data\Engines\amd64":::* folder from another working Exchange server, and then paste the files in the folder of the affected server.

**Note:** The *:::no-loc text="%ExchangeInstallPath%":::* value is typically **:::no-loc text="C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\":::** (includes a trailing "\\").
