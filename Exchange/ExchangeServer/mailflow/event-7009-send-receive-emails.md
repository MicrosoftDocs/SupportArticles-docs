# Event 7009 when users try to send or receive email in Exchange Server 2013 or Exchange Server 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2866822

## Symptoms

When a user tries to send email messages in an Exchange Server 2013 or Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 environment, the email is not sent as expected. Instead, it remains in the Outbox folder or the Drafts folder.

When this issue occurs, an event that resembles the following is logged in the Application folder:

Additionally, connection activity information that resembles the following is logged in the Mailbox Connectivity log. (Notice the "Server not active" error.)

```console

When you try to test SMTP communications by using Telnet, you receive a 412.4.3.2 error that resembles the following:

```

## Cause

This issue occurs if the Transport service is in an inactive state.

In Exchange Server, administrators can put servers in Maintenance mode. When a server is in Maintenance mode, it is in an inactive state and no longer accepts connections.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, set the Hub Transport component to an active state. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Run the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-ServerComponentState -Identity <Exchange_server_name>  -Requester Functional -State active -Component HubTransport
    ```

    If the `Set-ServerComponentState` cmdlet doesn't change the component state to active, run the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-ServerComponentState -Identity <Exchange_server_name>  -Requester Maintenance -State Active -Component HubTransport
    ```

2. Restart the Exchange Transport service.

## Verify that a server is inactive

To verify that a server is in an inactive state, run the `Get-ServerComponentState` cmdlet. The output from this cmdlet resembles the following:
