# The front-end Microsoft Exchange Transport service stops and doesn't restart in Exchange Server 2013 SP1 or Exchange Server 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2958036

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You upgrade to Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Service Pack 1 (SP1) or upgrade an Exchange Server 2016 server.
- The Exchange server has both back-end and front-end roles.
- You run the front-end Microsoft Exchange Transport service on the server.

In this scenario, the service stops and doesn't restart. Additionally, the following events are logged in the Application log:

```console

```

> [!NOTE]
> If you stop the Microsoft Exchange Transport service, you can start the front-end Microsoft Exchange Transport service. Then, when you try to start the Microsoft Exchange Transport service, that service doesn't start, and the events that are mentioned earlier in this section are logged.

## Cause

This issue occurs if there's a receive connector having a Transport type of HubTransport that has the binding set to port 25 on the affected Exchange server. Only the FrontendTransport server-type receive connector should have the binding set to port 25.

## Resolution

### Method 1

Run the following command to change the connector type from HubTransport to FrontendTransport:

```powershell
Set-ReceiveConnector -Identity "Receive connector name" -TransportRole FrontendTransport  
```

### Method 2

Delete and re-create the receive connector, and then set its role to **FrontendTransport**.
