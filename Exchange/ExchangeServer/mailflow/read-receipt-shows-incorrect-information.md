# Outlook read receipt shows incorrect information

## Symptoms

In Outlook, you request a read receipt for an email message that you send to an external recipient, but the received receipt incorrectly describes your message:

- The **To** field that specifies the recipients of your message is empty.

- The **Sent** field shows a timestamp that's later than when you actually sent the message. Also, the "sent" timestamp might be later than the "read" timestamp.

For example, the read receipt might contain the following text:

> Your message
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;To:
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Subject: Read receipt test
>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sent: Monday, February 13, 2023 3:53:45 PM (UTC+00:00) Monrovia, Reykjavik
>
> was read on Monday, February 13, 2023 3:53:42 PM (UTC+00:00) Monrovia, Reykjavik.

## Cause

The issue occurs if the [DSNConversionMode](/powershell/module/exchange/set-transportconfig#-dsnconversionmode) parameter value is set to `UseExchangeDSNs` in the transport configuration settings for your Microsoft Exchange organization.

> [!NOTE]
> The default value of the DSNConversionMode parameter in Exchange Server 2013 is `UseExchangeDSNs`. In later Exchange Server versions, the default value is `PreserveDSNBody`. However, if you upgraded from a previous Exchange Server version that had DSNConversionMode set to `UseExchangeDSNs`, the previous value might be retained.

## Resolution

To determine the [DSNConversionMode](/powershell/module/exchange/set-transportconfig#-dsnconversionmode) parameter value, run the following command:

```powershell
Get-TransportConfig | FL DSNConversionMode
```

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Change the DSNConversionMode parameter value to `PreserveDSNBody` by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-TransportConfig -DSNConversionMode PreserveDSNBody
   ```

   The DSNConversionMode parameter value `DoNotConvert` also fixes the issue.

2. Wait for the change to replicate, or restart the transport service by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Restart-Service MSExchangeTransport
   ```
