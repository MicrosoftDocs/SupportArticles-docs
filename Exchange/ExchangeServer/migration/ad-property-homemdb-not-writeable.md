# "Active Directory property ‎'homeMDB‎' isn't writeable on recipient" error when moving a mailbox to Microsoft 365

## Symptoms

When you move an on-premises Exchange mailbox to Microsoft 365, you receive the following error message:

> Error: MigrationPermanentException: Active Directory property ‎'homeMDB‎' isn't writeable on recipient ‎`contoso.com/Users/mailbox`. --> Active Directory property ‎'homeMDB‎' is not writeable on recipient `‎contoso.com/Users/mailbox‎‎`.

## Cause

This issue occurs for either or both of the following reasons:

- The **Include Inheritable permission from this object's parent/Enable Inheritance** check box is not selected.
- The on-premises server that's running Microsoft Exchange Server that's used from proxy isn't a member of the **Exchange Servers** and **Exchange Trusted Sub Systems** role groups.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the **Include Inheritable permission from this object's parent/Enable Inheritance** check box is selected in the **\<User Account\> Properties** dialog box of Active Directory. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**, select **View**, and then select the **Advanced Features** option.
    2. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**, locate the affected user, select **\<User Account\> Properties,** select **Security**, and then select **Advanced**.
    3. Select the **Include Inheritable permission from this object's parent/Enable Inheritance** check box.

1. Make sure that all servers that are running Exchange Server in the organization are the members of the **Exchange Servers** and **Exchange Trusted Sub Systems** role groups. To check or add members, follow these steps:

    1. Open **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
    2. Select **Microsoft Exchange Security Groups**.
    3. Select **Exchange Servers/Exchange Trusted Sub Systems**, select **Properties**, and then select **Members**.
    4. Select **Add**.
