# "MapiExceptionCorruptData" error when moving a mailbox to an Exchange Server 2013 database

## Symptoms

You're moving a mailbox from an organization that has Microsoft Exchange Server 2016-based servers or Exchange Server 2019-based servers to an Exchange Server 2013 database in another organization. When you use the `Remote` switch to initiate the cross-forest move of the mailbox from the target forest to the database, the move fails and generates the following error message:

> MapiExceptionCorruptData: Unable to write mailbox info.

:::image type="content" source="media/cannot-move-mailbox-to-Exchange-2013-database/MapiExceptionCorruptData-error-message.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the error message when you move the mailbox from the target forest to the database.":::

## Workaround

To avoid this issue, use the `Outbound` switch to initiate the move from the source forest.

```powershell
New-MoveRequest <mailbox name> -Outbound -RemoteHostName <MRS proxy endpoint> -RemoteCredential <credentials of the target forest> -TargetDeliveryDomain <target delivery domain> -RemoteTargetDatabase <name of the target database>
```
