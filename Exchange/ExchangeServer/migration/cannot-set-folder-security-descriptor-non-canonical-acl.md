# Error when you move a mailbox in an Exchange Server 2013 environment: Cannot set folder security descriptor with non-canonical ACL

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2764844

## Symptoms

When you try to move a mailbox in a Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 environment, you receive the following error message:
> Error: Cannot set folder security descriptor with non-canonical ACL.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the mailbox has a corrupted access control list (ACL).

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands to identify the ACL that causes this issue:

    ```powershell
    $mr = get-moverequeststatistics -IncludeReport <mailboxIdentity>  

    $mr.Report.Failures
    ```

2. Remove the corrupted ACL by using the ExFolders tool.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, run the following `new-MoveRequest` cmdlet together with the `-SkipMoving:FolderACls` switch:

```powersehll
New-moverequest -Identity <username> -Target Database "database name" -SkipMoving:FolderViews
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you move the mailbox by using the `-SkipMoving:FolderACls` switch, Exchange Server 2013 doesn't move the ACLs of the folders in the mailbox. Therefore, after you move the mailbox, all the folders have default permissions.
