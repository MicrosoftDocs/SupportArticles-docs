# Mailbox move request that you created by using the New-MoveRequest cmdlet isn't displayed in EAC in an Exchange Server 2013 environment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2764631

## Symptoms

When you use the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet to create a mailbox move request in a Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 environment, the mailbox move request isn't displayed in Exchange Administration Console (EAC).

## Cause

This behavior is by design.

Exchange Server 2013 introduces the `MigrationBatch` cmdlet so that you can create and manage mailbox move requests. When you use EAC to create a mailbox move request, EAC runs the `New-MigrationBatch` cmdlet in the background. Additionally, EAC runs the `Get-MigrationBatch` cmdlet so that the move request is displayed in EAC. However, the `Get-MigrationBatch` cmdlet only queries mailbox move requests that are created by using the `New-MigrationBatch` cmdlet. So when you run the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet in Exchange Management Shell (EMS) to create a mailbox move request, the mailbox move request isn't displayed in EAC.

## Resolution

To view the status of a mailbox move request that you created by using the `New-MoveRequest` cmdlet, run the `Get-MoveRequest` cmdlet in EMS.
