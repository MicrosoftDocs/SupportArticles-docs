# Outlook issues when the msExchMasterAccountSID attribute exists on a user account in Active Directory

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2996202

## Symptoms

After a mailbox move or migration, one or more of the following issues may be displayed:

- Some mailboxes show as linked or shared rather than as user mailboxes.
- Repeated mailbox credential prompts in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Web App (OWA)
- Unexpected delays in, or halted mail flow.
- Problems accessing Public Folders, and sometimes resulting in the following error:

    > Cannot expand the folder. Microsoft Exchange is not available. Either there are network problems or the Exchange Server is down for maintenance.

## Cause

This behavior can occur if a regular user account has the `msExchMasterAccountSID` attribute populated in Active Directory.

## Resolution

To correct this issue, run the following PowerShell command from the Exchange Management Shell:

```powershell
Set-User -Identity useraddress -LinkedMasterAccount $null
```

For example:

```powershell
Set-User -Identity user@fabricam.com -LinkedMasterAccount $null
```

This command will remove the `msExchMasterAccountSID` attribute from the user's account.

## More information

The `msExchMasterAccountSID` attribute shouldn't exist for a regular user account in Active Directory. A regular user will be identified as having an `msExchRecipientTypeDetails` attribute value of **1** (1 = normal mailbox, 2 = linked mailbox.)

If **msExchRecipientTypeDetails = 1**, then `msExchMasterAccountSID` shouldn't exist on the account in Active Directory.

For more information on possible values for the `msExchRecipientTypeDetails` attribute, see [O365: Exchange and AD - How msExchRecipientDisplayType and msExchangeRecipientTypeDetails Relate to Your On-Premises](https://vermagautam85.blogspot.com/2017/08/o365-exchange-and-ad-how.html).
