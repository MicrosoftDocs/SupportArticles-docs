# Error while migrating mailbox to Exchange Online: Cannot save changes made to an item to store

## Symptoms

When you migrate on-premises Exchange mailboxes to Exchange Online, you receive this error message:

> "Cannot save changes made to an item to store. --> MapiExceptionMessagePerFolderCountQuotaExceeded: Unable to save changes. (hr=0x80004005, ec=1252)"

## Cause

At least one on-premises mailbox folder exceeds the limit of 1 million items.

For more information about Exchange Online mailbox folder limits, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits#mailbox-folder-limits).

## Resolution

### For Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 and above

1. Run these commands in the on-premises PowerShell to check which folder contains more than 1 million items.

    ```powershell
    $root=Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity user@contoso.com

    $root | sort itemsinfolder -descending |ft folderpath,itemsinfolder
    ```

2. Check if any folder under **NonIpmRoot** contains more than 1 million items.

    ```powershell
    $non_root=Get-MailboxFolderStatistics user@contoso.com -FolderScope NonIpmRoot

    $non_root | sort itemsinfolder -descending |ft folderpath,itemsinfolder
    ```

3. If the problematic folder is accessible from Outlook or through the [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases/tag/20.0.20280.01) tool, move some items to other folders and resume the migration.

    There's a high chance that a folder named **Deferred action** contains more than 1 million items. You can delete some of them (HardDelete) using MFCMAPI. The folder is right below the root of the mailbox. To learn more about this folder, see [this article](/openspecs/exchange_server_protocols/ms-oxorule/0ae81043-05e6-47e4-aa3f-f546512e96b6).

### For Microsoft Exchange server 2010

1. Run this command in the on-premises PowerShell to check which folder contains more than 1 million items.

    ```powershell
    $root=Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity user@contoso.com

    $root | sort itemsinfolder -descending |ft folderpath,itemsinfolder
    ```

2. Move the items to other folders and resume the migration.
3. If you didn't find the folder in the command above, use [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases/tag/20.0.20280.01) to connect to the mailbox. Clean-up folders in **NonIpmRoot**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In Exchange Server 2010, `Get-MailboxFolderStatistics` doesn't have a `-FolderScope NonIpmRoot` switch.
