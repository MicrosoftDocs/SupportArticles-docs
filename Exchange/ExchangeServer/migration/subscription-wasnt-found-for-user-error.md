# Error (A subscription wasn't found for this user) when migrating a public folder batch

## Symptoms

When you migrate public folders from Exchange Server to Exchange Online, the migration status displays "Failed" or "SyncedWithError". Also, one or more migration users display "Failed" as their status. When you select the migration user in the Exchange admin center (EAC), you see the following warning message:

> The subscription for the migration user MLPF3 couldn't be loaded. The following error was encountered: A subscription wasn't found for this user.

You may also see another error message:

> Couldn't find a request that matches the information provided. Reason: No such request exists in the specified index.

## Cause

The issue can occur if the public folder mailbox migration request that is associated with the migration user is missing or corrupted, as shown in the following screenshot.

## Resolution

1. Stop the migration batch.
    > [!note]
    > Terminating the migration batch may take some time to finish.
2. Make sure that the migration batch has reached the "Stopped" state.
3. Restart the migration batch. This will re-create the missing public folder migration request.
