# Owner cannot create modern public folders by using Outlook in Exchange Server 2013 or Exchange Server 2016

## Symptoms

Assume that you are the owner of a public folder mailbox or have sufficient access permissions to create a public folder in a Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 or Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 environment. The mailbox uses the secondary hierarchy as the default public folder mailbox. In this situation, when you try to create a public folder by using Microsoft Outlook, you receive the following error message:

> Cannot create the folder. You do not have sufficient permission to perform this operation on this object.
See the folder contact or your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> If the default public folder mailbox is changed to a public folder mailbox that contains the primary hierarchy, you can create public folders by using Outlook.

See [More information about how to troubleshoot the issue](#more-information-to-troubleshoot-this-issue) in this article.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the `LmCompatibilityLevel` registry entry on the Exchange Server Mailbox Server role is configured to a value that is less than 2.

## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To work around this issue, follow these steps on the Exchange Server Mailbox Server role that is hosting the secondary hierarchy public folder mailbox:

1. Change the value of the `LmCompatibilityLevel` registry entry to _2_ or greater.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The entry is located under the following registry path:  
    > _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa_

2. Restart the following services:

   - Microsoft Exchange Information Store  
   - Microsoft Exchange RPC Client Access
   - Microsoft Exchange Health Manager

## More information
