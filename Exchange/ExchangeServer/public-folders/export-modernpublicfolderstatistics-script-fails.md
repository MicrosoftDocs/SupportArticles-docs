## Symptoms

After you install the November 2022 Microsoft Exchange Server security updates (SUs) or later SUs, you try to run *Export-ModernPublicFolderStatistics.ps1*, but the script fails and returns the following error message:

### Workaround 1

1. Open *Export-ModernPublicFolderStatistics.ps1* in a text editor.

2. Search for and replace all occurrences of `ToBytes()` with `ToString().Split("(")[1].Split(" ")[0].Replace(",","")`.

3. Save the modified content to a new file, such as *Export-ModernPublicFolderStatistics-Temp.ps1*.

4. Run *Export-ModernPublicFolderStatistics-Temp.ps1*.

### Workaround 2
