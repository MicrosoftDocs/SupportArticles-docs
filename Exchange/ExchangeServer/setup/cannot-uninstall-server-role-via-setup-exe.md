# The parameter roles is not valid error message when trying to uninstall Exchange Server 2013 server role

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2801813

## Symptoms

Assume that you try to uninstall the Exchange Server 2013 server role by running this command:

```console
Setup.exe /Mode:Uninstall /Roles:ClientAccess /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
```

However, you receive this error message:

> Welcome to Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Unattended Setup  
> The parameter 'roles' is not valid for current operation 'Uninstall'.  
> Setup checks failed: Invalid command line arguments.
>
> Please type 'setup.exe /help' for more information.

## Cause

This behavior is by design. The `/Roles` parameter is not valid for uninstallation operations. Therefore, you cannot uninstall individual roles from Exchange Server 2013.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, run the following command to uninstall Exchange Server 2013:

```console
Setup /Mode:Uninstall /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms
```
