# Cumulative Update 20 shows in Programs and Features if installing Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 22

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4492759

## Symptoms

After you successfully install Cumulative Update 22 for Exchange Server 2013, the **Programs and Features** item in Control Panel lists the installation as Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 20.

## Cause

This issue occurs because Exchange Server Setup does not update the version string in the registry correctly.

## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756/) in case problems occur.

To fix this issue, change the registry key for the update display name. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the **Start** menu, select **Run**, type *regedit* in the **Open** box, and then select **OK**.
2. Locate the following subkey:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Microsoft Exchange v15`
3. In the details pane, locate and double-click the **DisplayName** item.
4. In the **Value data** box, change the string to the following value:  
   **Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 Cumulative Update 22**  
5. Select **OK** to save the change.
