# Event 6010 entries fill the Application event log in Exchange Server 2016

## Symptoms

After you install Cumulative Update 23 for Microsoft Exchange Server 2016, event 6010 entries are continuously logged in the Application event log. These entries contain the following information:

```output
Event ID: 6010
Source: MSExchangeApplicationLogic
Description: Failed to read in memory manifest validation XSD schemas for version '1.1'.
```

This issue occurs only on Exchange 2016-based servers that aren't connected to the internet.

## Status

You can safely ignore all the instances of event 6010 that are logged. Microsoft is investigating this issue and will update this article when more information becomes available.
