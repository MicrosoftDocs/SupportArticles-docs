# Error when you try to install Exchange Server 2013 in RecoverServer mode

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3069005

## Symptoms

When you try to install Exchange Server 2013 in RecoverServer mode, the operation fails with the following error during Prerequisite Analysis:

> The language pack bundle could not be found or is corrupt.

## Cause

This behavior occurs if an earlier setup attempt has failed.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

To resolve this issue, remove the `Language Packs` registry key, and then run Setup again:

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type *regedit* in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
2. Expand the registry, and then select the following subkey:

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\ExchangeServer\v15\Lanaguage Packs`
3. Right-click `Language Packs`, and then click **Delete**.
4. Click **Yes** to confirm the deletion of the `Language Packs` subkey.
5. On the **File** menu, click **Exit** to close Registry Editor.
