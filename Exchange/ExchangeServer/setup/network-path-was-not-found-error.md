# Error when you run an Update cmdlet in an Exchange Server 2010 environment: The network path was not found

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2770541

## Symptoms

When you run an `Update` cmdlet in an Exchange Server 2010 environment, you receive an error message: The network path was not found. For example, when you run the `Update-MailboxDatabaseCopy -Identity "Database Name" -DeleteExistingFiles` cmdlet in Exchange Management Shell, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

> The network path was not found.
> Warning: An unexpected error has occurred and a Watson dump is being generated: The network path was not found.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Remote Registry service is stopped on the server where you run the `Update` cmdlet.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, start the Remote Registry service. To do this, follow steps:

1. On the computer where you want to run the cmdlet, select **Start**, type *services.msc* in the Start Search box, and then press Enter. Microsoft Management Console starts with the Services snap-in open.
2. In the console pane, right-click **Remote Registry**, and then select **Start**.
