# Error when installation of Exchange Edge Transport role fails: Process execution failed with exit code 3

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4495264

## Symptoms

When you install Exchange Server 2019, 2016, or 2013 Edge Transport server roles by using the Setup wizard, the installation fails and returns an error message that resembles the following:

> The following error was generated when "$error.Clear(); $dllFile = join-path $RoleInstallPath "bin\ExSMIME.dll"; $regsvr = join-path (join-path $env:SystemRoot system32) regsvr32.exe; start-SetupProcess -Name:"$regsvr" -Args:"/s `"$dllFile`"" -Timeout:120000; " was run: "Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.TaskException: Process execution failed with exit code 3.  
> at Microsoft.Exchange.Management.Tasks.RunProcessBase.InternalProcessRecord()  
> at Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.Task.b__91_1() at Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.Tasks.Task.InvokeRetryableFunc(String funcName, Action func, Boolean terminatePipelineIfFailed)".

## Cause

This issue occurs because Visual C++ 2012 isn't installed on the server. Visual C++ 2012 is required in order to include the Active Template Library (ATL).

## Resolution

To fix this issue, install Visual C++ 2012, and run the Setup wizard again.
