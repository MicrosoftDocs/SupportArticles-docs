# Error when you install the PST Capture tool in Windows Server 2008 R2: Setup wizard ended prematurely because of an error

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2844231

## Symptoms

When you try to install the PST Capture tool in Windows Server 2008 R2, the installation fails, and you receive the following error message:

> Setup wizard ended prematurely because of an error.

Additionally, the following error message may be logged in the setup file:

> ExecFirewallExceptions: Error 0x800706d9

The setup file is created when you run the PST Capture tool setup together with the following switch:

```console
PSTCapture.msi /lxv <Drive>:\log.txt
```  

> [!NOTE]
> In this command, the placeholder \<Drive> represents the drive location to which the setup logs will be saved.

## Cause

This issue may occur if the Windows Firewall service is disabled. For the PST Capture tool setup to succeed, the Windows Firewall service must be enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> By Default, the Windows Firewall service is enabled in Windows Server 2008 R2.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, start the Windows Firewall service on the server on which you're installing the PST capture tool.
