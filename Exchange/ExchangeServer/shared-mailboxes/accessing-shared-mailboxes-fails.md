# "NoPrimarySmtpAddress" error when accessing shared mailboxes through POP/IMAP in Exchange Server

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You're running Microsoft Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Server 2016, or Exchange Server 2013.
- Exchange Server is configured for POP/IMAP access.
- Shared mailboxes in the Exchange environment are configured to enable POP/IMAP access.
- A service account that isn't mail-enabled is granted permissions to the shared mailboxes.

In this scenario, users can't access the shared mailboxes through POP/IMAP by using the service account. Additionally, you see an error message in the POP/IMAP protocol logs that resembles the following:

**"R=""? NO LOGIN failed:"";Msg=NoPrimarySmtpAddress"**

When this problem occurs, the service account can still access the shared mailboxes through Microsoft Outlook, Outlook Web App, Exchange Web Services, or Exchange ActiveSync.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the POP/IMAP authentication process expects authenticated users to have a primary SMTP address defined.

## Resolution

To fix this problem, use either of the following methods (but only one).

### Method 1:  Create a mailbox for the service account

Use the Exchange Admin Center or Exchange Management Shell to create a mailbox for the service account. For more information about how to create a mailbox for an existing user, see [Create user mailboxes in Exchange Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/recipients/create-user-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019).

### Method 2:  Add a primary SMTP address to the proxyAddresses attribute

Add a primary SMTP address to the proxyAddresses attribute for the service account by using Active Directory Users and Computers. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
2. Select **View** > **Advanced Features**.
3. Find the user object for the service account.
4. Right-click the object, and then select **Properties**.
5. Select the **Attribute Editor** tab.
6. Find the **userPrincipalName** attribute and note the attribute value (for example, serviceaccount01@contoso.com).
7. Find the **proxyAddresses** attribute, and then select **Edit**.
8. In the **Value to add** text box, add the following text to set a primary SMTP address, and then select the **Add** button:

   **SMTP:serviceaccount01@contoso.com**

9. Select **OK** two times, and then close Active Directory Users and Computers.

After you make this change, ask users to access the shared mailboxes again through POP/IMAP.
