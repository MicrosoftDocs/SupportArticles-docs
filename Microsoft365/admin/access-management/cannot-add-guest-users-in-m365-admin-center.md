# Enabling guest users to access resources through the Microsoft 365 admin center

## Summary

Administrators can make a change in Settings to allow team leaders and users who are not admins to add other guest users who work remotely. 


## Resolution

### Non-admins

For non-admins (team leaders and other end users) to add guest users, follow these steps:

1. Have the administrator sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Go to the **Dashboard**, and then select **Users**. 
3. Select **User settings**. 
4. Under **External collaboration settings**, set **Members can invite** to **Yes**.

Non-admins will then be able to add guest users without admin approval.

**Microsoft recommends that admins make this change to alleviate the number of requests they may receive for remote access.**

For more detailed instructions, see [Step 2: Configure Azure AD business-to-business settings](/microsoftteams/guest-access-checklist#step-2-configure-azure-ad-business-to-business-settings) in the article [Microsoft Teams guest access checklist](/microsoftteams/guest-access-checklist#step-2-configure-azure-ad-business-to-business-settings). 

### Admins

For admins to directly add a guest user, go to **All users** in the [Azure Active Directory (AAD) admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/), and then select **New guest user**.
