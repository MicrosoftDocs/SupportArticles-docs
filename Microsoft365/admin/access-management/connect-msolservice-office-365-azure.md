# "The user name or password is incorrect" when you use connect-MSOLService to connect to Microsoft 365

## Problem

When you try to use the connect-MSOLService cmdlet in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell to connect to a Microsoft cloud service such as Microsoft 365, Azure, or Microsoft Intune, your attempt is unsuccessful. Additionally, you may receive the following error message:

**Connect-MsolService : The user name or password is incorrect. Verify your user name, and then type your password again.**

## Cause 

This issue may occur if the user name or password that you're using is incorrect or if there's a problem with the user account. 

## Solution
