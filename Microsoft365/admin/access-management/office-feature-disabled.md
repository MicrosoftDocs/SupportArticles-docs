# (This feature has been disabled by your administrator) error in Microsoft Office

## Symptoms

When you try to perform certain actions in Microsoft 365 Apps, Office LTSC 2021, Office 2019, Office 2016, or Office 2013 applications, you receive the following error message:

> This feature has been disabled by your administrator.

The actions that trigger this error message may include the following:

- On the **File** menu, you click **Account** or **Office Account**, and then you click **Sign In**.
- On the **File** menu, you click **Share**, and then you click **Present Online**.
- On Microsoft SharePoint Server or in OneDrive for Business, you click **Sync Now**.

In Office 2013, Office 2016, Office 2019, and Office LTSC 2021, this error affects connected experience. In Microsoft 365 Apps, this error affects Office licensing and connected experience.

## Cause

This issue occurs if one of the following registry values is configured as specified:

> [!NOTE]
> The *xx* placeholder in the following registry entry is **15** for Office 2013 and 16 for Office 2016, Office 2019, Office LTSC 2021 and Microsoft 365 Apps.

- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\Internet`

  Name: `UseOnlineContent`  
  Type: DWORD  
  Value: 0
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\Internet`
  
  Name: `UseOnlineContent`  
  Type: DWORD  
  Value: 0
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\SignIn`
  
  Name: `SignInOptions`  
  Type: DWORD  
  Value: 3
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\SignIn`
  
  Name: `SignInOptions`  
  Type: DWORD  
  Value: 3

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps to modify the registry:

1. Exit Microsoft Outlook.
1. Start Registry Editor. To do this, use one of the following procedures, as appropriate for your version of Windows:

   - Windows 10: In the search box on the taskbar, type **regedit**, then select **Registry Editor** (Desktop app) from the results.
   - Windows 8: Press Windows Key+R to open a **Run** dialog box. Then, type **regedit.exe**,and then press **OK**.
   - Windows 7: Click **Start**, type **regedit.exe** in the search box, and then press Enter.

1. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following subkey:

   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\Internet`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *xx* placeholder is **15** for Office 2013, and **16** for Office 2016, Office 2019, Office LTSC 2021, and Microsoft 365 Apps.

1. Locate and then double-click the following value: `UseOnlineContent`.
1. In the **Value Data** box, type **2**, and then click **OK**.
1. Locate and then click the following subkey:

   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\SignIn`

   > [!NOTE]
   > The *xx* placeholder is **15** for Office 2013 and **16** for Office 2016, Office 2019, Office LTSC 2021, and Microsoft 365 Apps.

   For Microsoft 365 Apps, you also locate and select this subkey:

   `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Cloud\Office\16.0\Common\SignIn`

1. Locate and then double-click the following value: `SignInOptions`.
1. In the **Value Data** box, type **0**, and then click **OK**.
1. Exit Registry Editor.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `UseOnlineContent` or `SignInOptions` value is located under the **Policies** hive, it may have been created by Group Policy. In this situation, your administrator must modify the policy to change this setting if the administrator set the value.

## More Information

The `UseOnlineContent` setting controls users' access to the Office online features. This setting can be configured by using the following values:

- 0 = Don't allow Office to connect to the Internet. Office applications don't connect to the Internet to access online services or to download the latest online content from Office.com. Connected features of Office are disabled.
- 2 = Allow Office to connect to the Internet. Office applications use online services and download the latest online content from Office.com when users' computers are connected to the Internet. Connected features of Office are enabled. This option enforces the default configuration.

The `SignInOptions` setting controls whether users can provide credentials to Office by using either their Windows Live ID or the user ID that was assigned by their organization (Org ID) for accessing Microsoft 365. This setting can be configured by using the following values:

- 0 = Both IDs allowed
- 1 = Microsoft Account only (see the note below)
- 2 = Org ID only
- 3 = Users can't sign in by using either ID (see the note below)

> [!NOTE]
> Based on the [recent license improvements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/office-365-blog/office-365-client-licensing-and-activation-improvements/ba-p/763694), users are required to sign in to activate Office on their devices. We don't recommend using options **1** and **3** for `SignInOptions` in Microsoft 365 Apps. Either of these options will block sign-ins that use work accounts or Azure Active Directory (AAD) accounts and users won't be able to access Office clients.
