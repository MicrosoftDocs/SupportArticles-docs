# Users can't change their office phone number when they set up Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem

When a user tries to set up Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, the user can't select or change the **Office Phone** option. The user can't edit the phone number because the text box is unavailable (appears dimmed). Additionally, the user can't set the office phone as the preferred contact method. 

## Cause 

This problem occurs for on-premises users who are synchronized from the on-premises Active Directory environment to Azure Active Directory. 

## Solution 

Change the user's office phone number in the on-premises Active Directory.
