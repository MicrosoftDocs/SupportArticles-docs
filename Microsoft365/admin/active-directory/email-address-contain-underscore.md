# Office 365 email address contains an underscore character after directory synchronization

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

After the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Sync Tool runs to sync your on-premises Active Directory environment to Azure Active Directory, a user's Office 365 email address unexpectedly contains an underscore character "_".Â 

## Cause

This occurs if the user account in your on-premises environment has a **proxyaddresses** attribute or **mail** attribute that contains one or more of the following special characters before the "@domain.com" part of the address:

|Character | Name |
|----------|------|
||space character |
|`|apostrophe |
|(|opening parenthesis |
|)|closing parenthesis |
|'|single quotation mark |
|&|ampersand |
|   \|  |pipe |
|=|equal sign |
|?|question mark |
|/|forward slash |
|%|percent |
    
In this scenario, after directory synchronization is run, the special character is replaced by an underscore character. Therefore, the user's Office 365 email address contains an underscore character instead of the special character. 

## Resolution

Remove the special characters from the **proxyaddresses** attribute of the user account in the on-premises environment.

## More information

The characters that are listed in the Cause section are treated as special characters in Office 365. Use of any of these characters may cause issues such as service disruption.
