# "You first must install one of the following versions of .NET Framework" when you run the IdFix tool

## Problem

When you try to run the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool in your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment, you receive the following error message:

```output
To run this application, you first must install one of the following versions of .NET Framework. 
```

This issue occurs if the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 isn't installed on the computer. The IdFix tool requires the .NET Framework 4 to run. 

## Solution

To resolve this issue, install the .NET Framework 4 on the computer on which the IdFix tool is installed. The .NET Framework 4 is available from [Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer)](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17851).
