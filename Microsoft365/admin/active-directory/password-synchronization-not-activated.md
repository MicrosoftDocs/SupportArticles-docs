# User passwords aren't synced, and "Password Synchronization has not been activated for this company" error is logged in Event Viewer

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem 

After you discover that some users can't sign in to a Microsoft cloud service such as Office 365, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft Azure, you notice that user passwords aren't being synced from your local Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment to Azure Active Directory. When you view the Application login Event Viewer, you see that the following event ID 6900 error is logged:

    The server encountered an unexpected error while processing a password change notification: 
    "An error occurred. Error Code: 90. Error Description: Password Synchronization has not been activated for this company

This issue may occur if password synchronization was disabled after it was set up in the Azure Active Directory sync appliance.

## Solution 

To resolve this issue, enable password synchronization. To do this, take one of the following actions, as appropriate to the Azure Active Directory sync appliance that you're running.
### If you're running the Azure Active Directory Sync tool
Run the Azure Active Directory Sync Configuration Wizard, and then, on the Password Synchronization page, select the **Enable Password Synchronization** check box. Doing this finishes password synchronization set up and starts a full sync. 
### If you're running Azure Active Directory Connect


1. Open Windows PowerShell.   
2. Run the following commands:
   1. Import-Module ADSync    
   2. $aadcon = Get-ADSyncConnector | Where {$_.Type -eq "Extensible2"}    
   3. Set-ADSyncAADPasswordSyncState -ConnectorName $aadcon. Name -Enable $True
