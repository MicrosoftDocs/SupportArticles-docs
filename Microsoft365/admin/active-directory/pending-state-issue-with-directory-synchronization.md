# Fix pending state issue with Directory synchronization for Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune


## Symptoms

You experience one of the following symptoms in a Microsoft cloud service such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune:

- When you activate directory synchronization in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/dirsyncmanagement), the page indicates that directory synchronization is enabled. However, when you install the Azure Active Directory Sync tool and run the Configuration Wizard, you receive the following message:

    `Error 15: DirSync not activated`

    You then revisit the [Directory sync status](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/dirsyncmanagement) page to view the directory synchronization status. When you look under **3: Active Directory Synchronization** in the center pane, you see the following message:

    `Active Directory synchronization is being activated`

- When you deactivate directory synchronization on the [Directory sync status](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/dirsyncmanagement) page of the Microsoft 365 portal, the page indicates that directory synchronization is enabled.

    You then revisit the [Directory sync status](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/dirsyncmanagement) page to view the directory synchronization status. When you look under **3: Active Directory Synchronization** in the center pane, you see the following message:

    `Active Directory synchronization is being deactivated`


## Cause

This issue may occur if directory synchronization isn't completely activated or deactivated. It may take up to 72 hours for activation or deactivation to finish.

To determine whether directory synchronization is activated or deactivated, follow these steps by using the Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell:

1. Select **Start**, type **Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell** in the search box, and then select **Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell**.
1. Type the following cmdlets in the order in which they are presented. Make sure that you press Enter after you type each cmdlet.

    - `$cred = get-credential`

        > [!NOTE]
        > When you're prompted, enter your cloud service admin credentials.

    - `Connect-MSOLService -credential $cred`
    - `(Get-MSOLCompanyInformation).DirectorySynchronizationEnabled`

        > [!NOTE]
        > This cmdlet returns a value of  **True** or **False**. If it returns **True**, directory synchronization is activated. If it is **False**, directory synchronization is deactivated.

## Resolution

Wait until directory synchronization is activated or deactivated. Note the following:

- If you enabled directory synchronization for the first time, activation may require up to 24 hours.
- If you **re-enabled** directory synchronization, activation may require up to 72 hours. For more information, see [Can't manage or remove objects that were synchronized through the Azure Active Directory Sync tool](/troubleshoot/azure/active-directory/cannot-manage-objects).
- If you disabled directory synchronization, deactivation may require up to 72 hours.

If directory synchronization isn't activated or deactivated after the expected time, follow these steps, and then contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/):

1. In the same Windows PowerShell console that you used in step 2 of the "Cause" section, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:

    `(Get-MSOLCompanyInformation).DirectorySynchronizationStatus`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the output indicates **"PendingEnabled"** or **"PendingDisabled"** after the 24-hour or 72-hour waiting period ends, this is a known issue that affects Exchange Online.

1. Collect the following information from the Windows PowerShell connection:

    - **Context ID**: To collect the context ID, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:

        `(Get-MSOLCompanyInformation).objectID`

    - **Service instance**: To collect the service instance, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:

        `(Get-MSOLCompanyInformation).AuthorizedServiceInstances`

1. Contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/).
