# "Duplicate" is displayed in the ERROR column for two or more objects after you run the IdFix tool

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem

When you run the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool in your on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment, "duplicate" is displayed in the **ERROR** column for one or more objects.

This problem occurs if two or more objects have the same email address.

## Solution

To resolve this problem, specify a unique email address for the object. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the **UPDATE** column for the object, type an email address that isn't already used.    
2. In the **ACTION** column, click **EDIT**, and then click **Apply**.   
3. Run IdFix again to look for more object errors.
