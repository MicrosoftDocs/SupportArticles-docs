# Resolve errors during orchestrated migration (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tenant-to-tenant migration is currently available in preview. Features and availability might change before general availability (GA).

This article provides lists of errors that you might experience during user data migration, and the recommended actions that you can take to resolve them.

## Errors from incorrect API calls

| **Error code** | **Error message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP 409 Conflict** | `Conflict`<br><br>Cross Tenant Migration Job \<ID> must be in final state (Completed, Failed, or Cancelled) before it can be deleted.<br><br>`resourceTypeMismatch` | Currently, the job can't be deleted because it's not in a terminal state. The job must be in a Failed, Canceled, or Completed state before it can be deleted. | Cancel the job, or wait for it to reach a Failed or Completed state. Then, retry the delete request. |
| **HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity** | `BadArgument` <br><br> Error in `displayName` data field `duplicateDisplayNameJob`<br><br> `displayName` already exists. Please provide a unique job `displayName`. | Each newly submitted batch (validation or migration) must have a unique batch name. | Resubmit the batch by using a unique batch name. |
| **HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity** | `BadArgument`<br><br>Error in `completeAfterDateTime` data field `minThresholdFailed` <br><br>`completeAfterDateTime` must be greater than the current time. | The `completeAfterDateTime` value is in the past.

## General errors

| **Error code** | **Error message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|

It could be in mapped state. | Either wait for identity mapping to finish or run the complete identity mapping steps. |
| **CTM-102** | Service is experiencing a high volume of requests and we are unable to validate the user at this time. Please resubmit the user as part of a different batch after some time. | The service is experiencing a high volume of requests and can't validate the user at this time.

## Exchange mailbox migration errors

| **Error code** | **Error message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EXCH-07** | No valid migration endpoints for the remote tenant. | Either a misspelling exists in the migration endpoint name that's provided in the input JSON file, or the target tenant doesn't have a tenant-to-tenant mailbox migration endpoint configured for the remote source tenant. | Verify that the migration endpoint name that's provided is correct, and follow the setup documentation to create a tenant-to-tenant migration endpoint, if it's necessary. |
| **EXCH-08** | Setup validation failed. Contact your admin.<br><br>Or<br><br>The connection to the server `outlook.office.com` could not be completed. Please make sure source mailbox is in the migration scope, scope identifier is set in Organization Relationship, and migration setup between source mailbox and target mail user is correct.<br><br>Or<br><br>`Test-MigrationServerAvailability` failed with: {0} | `Test-MigrationServerAvailability -Endpoint \<endpoint> -TestMailbox [meu@target.com](mailto:meu@target.com)>` failed. The `Test-MigrationServerAvailability` check is a high-level validation method that's used for tenant-to-tenant migration. This failure indicates one or more of the following issues:<br><br><ul><li> The target object isn't found.<br><br><li> The source object or source organization has litigation hold enabled and can't be migrated cross-tenant without being added to the exception list.<br><br><li> The source object wasn't added to the migration scope.<br><br><li> The source mailbox exceeds the quota and can't be migrated cross-tenant.<br><br><li> A mismatch exists on the `ExchangeGuid` value that's stamped on the source and target objects.<br><br><li> The `MailboxMoveRemoteHostName` field of the source mailbox isn't empty. This condition means either that mailbox was being moved in another batch or the `MailboxMoveRemoteHostName` field wasn't cleared when the previous request was cleaned. Use `Set-Mailbox -AttributesToClear MailboxMoveRemoteHostName`, then retry the migration.<br><br><li> The OAuth setup was completed incorrectly. To troubleshoot the issue, use this [Cross Tenant Mailbox Migration Validation](https://microsoft.github.io/CSS-Exchange/Admin/CrossTenantMailboxMigrationValidation/) script.<br><br><li> None of the source or target objects have a cross-tenant mailbox migration license assigned. Assign the license, and retry the job. The target object is either missing an `ExchangeGuid` or an `ArchiveGuid` value.<br><br><li> Either the source or target objects have a soft deleted user. To find the soft deleted users and remove them, run `Get-Mailbox -IncludeSoftDeletedMailbox/Get-MailUser -SoftDeletedMailUser`. | To avoid most issues:<br><br><li> Complete a correct identity mapping.<br><br><li> Set up the non-Microsoft OAuth app correctly, and their Exchange objects such as `OrgRel` (organization relationship) and `MigrationEndpoint`. To find the root cause of the issue, run this [Cross Tenant Mailbox Migration Validation](https://microsoft.github.io/CSS-Exchange/Admin/CrossTenantMailboxMigrationValidation/) script. |
| **EXCH-15** | Max retry for user with id {0} reached. | The maximum number of retries on `EXOHandler` is reached. A server-side issue might be occurring. Retry the job by creating a new migration batch. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft Support for help. | Create a migration batch. |
