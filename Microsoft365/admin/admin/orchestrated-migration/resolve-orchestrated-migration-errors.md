# Resolve errors during orchestrated migration (preview)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tenant-to-tenant migration is currently available in preview. Features and availability might change before general availability (GA).

This article provides lists of errors that you might see during user data migration and the actions you can take to resolve them.

## Errors from Incorrect API Calls

| **Error Code** | **Error Message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HTTP 409 Conflict** | `Conflict`<br><br>Cross Tenant Migration Job \<ID> must be in final state (Completed, Failed, or Cancelled) before it can be deleted.<br><br>`resourceTypeMismatch` | Jobs can be deleted, but only if the job isn't in progress. | Cancel the migration and retry the deletion, or wait until it completes or fails to delete it. |
| **HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity** | `BadArgument` <br><br> Error in `displayName` data field `duplicateDisplayNameJob`<br><br> `displayName` already exists. Please provide a unique job `displayName`. | Each newly submitted batch (validation or migration) needs a unique batch name. | Resubmit the batch with a unique batch name. |
| **HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity** | `BadArgument`<br><br>Error in `completeAfterDateTime` data field `minThresholdFailed` <br><br>`completeAfterDateTime` must be greater than the current time. | The `completeAfterDateTime` submitted is in the past. It should be in the future. | Resubmit the request to update the `completeAfterDateTime` to a future date. |

## General Errors

| **Error Code** | **Error Message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IM-003** | User migration failed. User \<X> is not mapped to an identity on tenant \<Y>. User \<X> must be added to the identity mapping, and then you must re-run identity mapping with this user and then retry the migration. | Admins haven't added the user to the identity mapping system. | Add the user to identity mapping and map them. |
| **MIGR-001** | Tenant authorization error. The tenants are not configured to support migration. | The Organization Relationship isn't configured properly. | Edit the Organization Relationship to properly authorize migration. |
| **MIGR-002** | User migration failed. User \<X> is not authorized to migrate. To authorize \<X>, add them to security group \<Y> and then retry the migration. | Admins haven't authorized the user to migrate. The user needs to be a member of the security group. | Add the user to the security group on the source tenant. |
| **MIGR-003** | User \[X] migration failed. Please retry user migration. | A user's migration failed, and the admin must retry it. | Retry migration. |
| | Authorization error. Either one or both of the tenant Organization Relationships isn't configured correctly, or the user isn't a member of the authorized security group. | Either the Organization Relationships aren't configured correctly, or the user isn't a member of the security group that authorizes the user's data to move. | Edit the Organization Relationship and/or add the user to the security group. |

## Cross-Tenant Migration Service Errors

| **Error Code** | **Error Message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CTM-001** | User migration validation failed. User is already a part of same batch. | User migration validation failed. User is already a part of another batch {0} | No action. User is already a part of the batch. |
| **CTM-002** | User migration validation failed. User is already a part of another batch {0} | The user was submitted in another batch that is currently running. | No action. User is already a part of a batch. |

| **CTM-101** | User migration validation failed. User identity mapping not in completed state. Mapping state is \<state from IM>. Refer to identity mapping documentation to complete the process or fix the errors. | Identity mapping found, but not in completed state. It could be in mapped state. | Either wait for identity mapping to complete or run the complete identity mapping steps. |
| **CTM-102** | Service is experiencing a high volume of requests and we are unable to validate the user at this time. Please resubmit the user as part of a different batch after some time. | The service is experiencing a high volume of requests and is unable to validate the user at this time. Resubmit the user as part of a different batch after some time. | Retry migration. |

## Exchange Mailbox Migration Errors

| **Error Code** | **Error Message** | **Description** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **EXCH-07** | No valid migration endpoints for the remote tenant. | Either there's a misspelling in the migration endpoint name provided in the input JSON file, or the target tenant doesn't have a tenant-to-tenant mailbox migration endpoint configured for the remote source tenant. | Confirm that the migration endpoint name provided is correct and follow the setup documentation to create a tenant-to-tenant migration endpoint if necessary. |
| **EXCH-08** | Setup validation failed. Contact your admin.<br><br>Or<br><br>The connection to the server `outlook.office.com` could not be completed. Please make sure source mailbox is in the migration scope, scope identifier is set in Organization Relationship, and migration setup between source mailbox and target mail user is correct.<br><br>Or<br><br>`Test-MigrationServerAvailability` failed with: {0} | `Test-MigrationServerAvailability -Endpoint \<endpoint> -TestMailbox [meu@target.com](mailto:meu@target.com)>` failed. The `Test-MigrationServerAvailability` check is a high-level validation method used for tenant-to-tenant migration. Failing this check can indicate one or more of the following issues:<br><br>- The target object isn't found.<br><br>- The source object or source organization has litigation hold enabled and can't be migrated cross-tenant without being added to the exception list.<br><br>- The source object wasn't added to the migration scope.<br><br>- The source mailbox exceeds the quota and can't be migrated cross-tenant.<br><br>- There's a mismatch on the `ExchangeGuid` stamped on the source and target objects.<br><br>- The source mailbox's `MailboxMoveRemoteHostName` isn't empty, which means either it was being moved in another batch or the `MailboxMoveRemoteHostName` wasn't cleared when the previous request was cleaned. Use `Set-Mailbox -AttributesToClear MailboxMoveRemoteHostName`, then retry migration.<br><br>- The OAuth setup was completed incorrectly. Use this script to troubleshoot the issue: [Cross Tenant Mailbox Migration Validation](https://microsoft.github.io/CSS-Exchange/Admin/CrossTenantMailboxMigrationValidation/).<br><br>- None of the source or target objects have a cross-tenant mailbox migration license assigned. Assign the license and retry. The target object is either missing an `ExchangeGuid` or an `ArchiveGuid`.<br><br>- Either the source or target objects have a soft deleted user. Use `Get-Mailbox -IncludeSoftDeletedMailbox/Get-MailUser -SoftDeletedMailUser` to find the soft deleted users and remove them. | You can avoid most of the issues by:<br><br>- Completing a correct identity mapping.<br><br>- Setting up the non-Microsoft OAuth app correctly, and their Exchange objects such as `OrgRel` (organization relationship) and `MigrationEndpoint`. Use this script to find the root cause of the issue: [Cross Tenant Mailbox Migration Validation](https://microsoft.github.io/CSS-Exchange/Admin/CrossTenantMailboxMigrationValidation/). |
| **EXCH-15** | Max retry for user with id {0} reached. | The maximum number of retries on `EXOHandler` is reached. A server-side issue might be going on. Retry by creating a new migration batch. And if the issue persists, contact Microsoft Support for help. | Create a new migration batch. |
