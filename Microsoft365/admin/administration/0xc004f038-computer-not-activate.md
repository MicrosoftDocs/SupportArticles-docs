# "0xC004F038: The computer could not be activated" error in KMS activation

This article was written by [Eric Ashton](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/EricAshton), Senior Support Escalation Engineer.

## Symptoms

You try to activate Microsoft Office 2013 or Office 2016 through the Key Management Service (KMS) host by using any of the following methods:

- Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT)
- Office activation wizard from a client computer
- OSPP.vbs /act script

However, you receive the following error message:
```adoc
0xC004F038: The Software Licensing Service reported that the computer could not be activated. The count reported by your Key Management Service (KMS) is insufficient. Please contact your system administrator.  
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Office KMS pool contains fewer than five unique client computers.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, increase the number of client computers in the Office KMS pool to five or more.

> [!NOTE]
> To determine how many client computers are currently in the Office KMS pool on the KMS host, run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window from c:\windows\system32, and then press Enter:
>
> **Cscript slmgr.vbs -dlv all >c:\temp\KMSInfo.txt**

Go to c:\temp (or any custom location where you put the output), and then open KMSInfo.txt. Search for Office to find your Office KMS host installation details. Check the **Current Count** value. If the Office KMS count value is less than **5**, Office clients will not activate.

When the Office KMS pool contains five or more client computers, try to activate Office by using the Office activation wizard, [OSPP.vbs](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/vlactivation/tools-to-manage-volume-activation-of-office), or VAMT.

If you use System Preparation (Sysprep) in your environment, it is possible that Office was not rearmed before the image creation. Therefore, computers may have the same client computer ID (CMID) for Office.

If you have more than five computers that are trying to activate, and you still see this error message, check the KMS host log on Event Viewer on the KMS server. For example, you see entries that resembles the following:
- 0x0,5,Ignite1.ignite.local,930bd202-a335-4c7e-bd9d-7305361f0d37,Date/Time,0,5,0,6f327760-8c5c-417c-9b61-836a98287e0c
- 0x0,5,Ignite2.ignite.local,2f362dd3-fb39-4d18-94e6-de1d30dd27d5,Date/Time,0,5,0,6f327760-8c5c-417c-9b61-836a98287e0c
- 0x0,5,Ignite5.ignite.local,930bd202-a335-4c7e-bd9d-7305361f0d37,Date/Time,0,5,0,6f327760-8c5c-417c-9b61-836a98287e0c

In this example, notice that Ignite5 and ignite1 have the same CMID (930bd202-a335-4c7e-bd9d-7305361f0d37). This indicates that the Office rearm was skipped even though the base operating system image may have been generated.

> [!NOTE]
> Before Sysprep prepares the image, make sure that you run one of the following commands, based on your Office bit version, to guarantee a unique Office CMID.
>
> **32-bit Office:**  
> **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospprearm.exe**
>
> **64-bit Office:**  
> **C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\ospprearm.exe**

For detailed information about how to rearm the Office installation, see the following articles:  

- [Rearm the Office 2013 installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/office-2013-resource-kit/dn385362%28v%3doffice.15%29)
- [Rearm a volume licensed version of Office that's included in an operating system image](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/vlactivation/rearm-an-office-installation-on-an-image-when-using-kms-to-activate)

You can run the following startup script on these computers to rearm Office and generate new, unique Office IDs. In this script, replace XX with the appropriate value, based on your Office version:

*XX* = 15 for Office 2013

*XX* = 16 for Office 2016

@echo off

:OSPP 

reg query HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\XX.0\Common\OSPPREARM if %errorlevel%==1 (goto RUN) else (goto END)

:RUN set ProgramFilesPath=%ProgramFiles% 

"%ProgramFilesPath%\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX\OSPPREARM.EXE"

C:\Windows\system32\cscript.exe "%ProgramFilesPath%\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX\ospp.vbs" /act set ProgramFilesPath=%ProgramFiles(x86)%

"%ProgramFilesPath%\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX\OSPPREARM.EXE"

C:\Windows\system32\cscript.exe "%ProgramFilesPath%\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX\ospp.vbs" /act REG ADD "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Office\XX.0\Common\OSPPREARM"
