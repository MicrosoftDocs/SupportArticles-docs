# Enable or disable hyperlink warning messages in 2007 Office programs and in Office 2010 programs

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Introduction

This step-by-step article describes how to enable or to disable the display of a warning message every time that you click a hyperlink in a 2007 Microsoft Office program or in a Microsoft Office 2010 program. 

## More Information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

In 2007 Office and in Office 2010, when you click a hyperlink or an object that links to an executable file, you receive the following warning message: 

```adoc
Opening "path/filename". 

Hyperlinks can be harmful to your computer and data. To protect your computer, click only those hyperlinks from trusted sources. Do you want to continue? 
```

This behavior occurs regardless of your security level settings. 

> [!NOTE]
> To locate your security level settings, point to **Macro** on the **Tools** menu, and then click **Security**. 

Additionally, when you open either TIFF images or Microsoft Document Imaging (MDI) files, you receive the following warning message: 

```adoc
Opening path/filename. 

Some files can contain viruses or otherwise be harmful to your computer. It is important to be certain that this file is from a trustworthy source. Would you like to open this file?
```

You receive this warning message even when you have already implemented the registry key that this article describes. This warning message comes from the HLINK.dll file when link navigation is handled. You can differentiate the 2007 Office or 2010 Office hyperlink warning message from the HLINK warning message by looking for quotation marks around the file path in the warning message. The 2007 Office or Office 2010 message contains quotation marks. The HLINK message does not contain quotation marks. 2007 Office and Office 2010 try to determine whether the file type itself is unsafe by checking the extension, the progid, the classid, and the MIME type of the document.
 
### How to globally enable or disable hyperlink warnings

To have us enable hyperlink warnings for 2007 Office programs and for Office 2010 programs for you, go to the "Here's an easy fix" section. If you prefer to enable the setting yourself, go to the "Let me fix it myself" section.

#### Here's an easy fix
 
To fix this problem automatically, download and run "Microsoft Easy Fix 20189",and then follow the steps in the easy fix wizard.

##### Enable hyperlink warnings

#### Let me fix it myself

To enable or to disable the hyperlink warnings in 2007 Office programs and in Office 2010 programs when an https:// address, a notes:// address, or an ftp:// address is used, you must create a new registry subkey. To do this, follow these steps:

2. In the **Open** dialog box, type **regedit**, and then click **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - You have to modify only one of these registry subkeys. You do not have to modify both.    
    > - If the Security subkey already exists, go directly to step 6 after you select the Security subkey.   
3. In Registry Editor, locate one of the following registry subkeys for 2007 Office: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Common**Or, in Registry Editor, locate one of the following registry subkeys for Office 2010: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common**

### How to enable or disable hyperlink warnings per protocol

To disable the display of security warnings for a specific protocol, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit, and then click **OK**. 

2. Locate the following registry subkey: 

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\xx.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications**

3. Click the All Applications subkey.   
4. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Key**.
