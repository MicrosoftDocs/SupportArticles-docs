# "Domain has associated subdomains" when removing a domain from Office 365

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem

If you try to remove a domain from Microsoft Office 365, you experience one or both of the following symptoms:

- When you try to remove the domain through the Office 365 portal, you receive the following error message:

  **Domain has associated subdomains.**

- When you try to remove the domain by using Windows PowerShell, you receive the following error message:

  ```asciidoc
  Remove-MsolDomain : You cannot remove a domain that has subdomains. You must first delete the subdomains before you can remove this domain.
  At line:1 char:18
  + Remove-MsolDomain <<<< -DomainName <DomainName>
  + CategoryInfo : OperationStopped: (:) [Remove-MsolDomain], MicrosoftOnlineException
  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.DomainHasChildDomainException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.RemoveDomain
  ```

This issue occurs if the domain has associated subdomains.

## Solution

To fix this issue, remove all subdomains that contain the domain that you're trying to delete.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- You have two domains: www.contoso.com and contoso.com.
- You want to remove the contoso.com domain.

In this scenario, you must also remove the http://www.contoso.com subdomain to remove the contoso.com domain.
