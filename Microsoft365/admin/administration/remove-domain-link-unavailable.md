# The "Remove" link is unavailable when removing a domain from Office 365

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## PROBLEM

When you try to remove a domain from Microsoft Office 365, you experience one of the following symptoms:

- The Remove link is unavailable.
- When you try to remove the domain by using Windows PowerShell, you receive the following error message:
  
  ```asciidoc
  Remove-MsolDomain : You cannot remove the initial domain created for you in Office 365.
  At line:1 char:18
  + Remove-MsolDomain <<<< -DomainName <DomainName>
  + CategoryInfo : OperationStopped: (:) [Remove-MsolDomain], MicrosoftOnlineException
  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.InitialDomainDeletionException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.RemoveDomain
  ```

## CAUSE

This issue occurs if the domain is the Microsoft Online routing domain. The Microsoft Online routing domain is the domain that's issued to you by Office 365 (for example, contoso.onmicrosoft.com). This domain can't be deleted. Therefore, the Remove link is unavailable.
