# The "Remove" link is unavailable when removing a domain from Microsoft 365

## PROBLEM

When you try to remove a domain from Microsoft 365, you experience one of the following symptoms:

- The Remove link is unavailable.
- When you try to remove the domain by using Windows PowerShell, you receive the following error message:
  
  ```output
  Remove-MsolDomain : You cannot remove the initial domain created for you in Office 365.
  At line:1 char:18
  + Remove-MsolDomain <<<< -DomainName <DomainName>
  + CategoryInfo : OperationStopped: (:) [Remove-MsolDomain], MicrosoftOnlineException
  + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.InitialDomainDeletionException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.RemoveDomain
  ```

## CAUSE

This issue occurs if the domain is the Microsoft Online routing domain. The Microsoft Online routing domain is the domain that's issued to you by Microsoft 365 (for example, `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`). This domain can't be deleted. Therefore, the Remove link is unavailable.
