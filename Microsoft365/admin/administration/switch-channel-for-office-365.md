# How to switch from Semi-Annual Channel to Monthly Channel for the Office 365 suite

## Summary

If you have just installed Office 365, and you're on the default Semi-Annual update channel, you might have a reason to move to the Monthly update channel. For example, a fix or a new feature has been released, and you want to move to the Monthly Channel to receive it.  

To switch from the Semi-Annual Channel to the Monthly Channel, follow these steps: 
 
1. Identify the value of the **CDNBaseURL** registry keyfor the channel that you want to switch to. To learn how, see [this Docs article](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/sum/deploy-use/manage-office-365-proplus-updates#change-the-update-channel-after-you-enable-office-365-clients-to-receive-updates-from-configuration-manager).    
2. Start Notepad, paste the following script into Notepad, and then save the file by using a .bat extension:

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the following script, notice that the value of **CDNBaseURL** is set to the URL of the Monthly channel that’s identified in step 1. If you want to switch to a different channel, you can use the appropriate URL from the referenced article in step 1.

    ```powershell
    setlocal reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration\ /v CDNBaseUrl if %errorlevel%==0 (goto SwitchChannel) else (goto End) :SwitchChannel reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration /v CDNBaseUrl /t REG_SZ /d "https://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/492350f6-3a01-4f97-b9c0-c7c6ddf67d60" /f reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration /v UpdateUrl /f reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration /v UpdateToVersion /f reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Updates /v UpdateToVersion /f reg delete HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\OfficeUpdate\ /f :End Endlocal
    ```
3. Right-click the script file, and then click **Run as administrator**. 
4. Start an Office application (such as Excel), and then select **File** > **Account**.    
5. In the **Product Information** section, select **Update Options** > **Update Now**.    

To switch to a different channel by using the Office Deployment Tool (ODT), follow these steps: 

1. Download the latest version of the ODT (setup.exe) from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=626065).    
2. Identify the name of the channel to which you want to switch. To learn how, see [Channel attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool#channel-attribute-part-of-add-element).    
3. Create a configuration XML file that specifies the appropriate channel name, such as the following update.xml file.  

    ```xml
    <Configuration> 
    <Updates Channel="Monthly" /> 
    </Configuration>
    ```
1. From an elevated command prompt, switch to the folder location where setup.exe resides, and then run the following command:  

    ```powershell
    setup.exe /configure update.xml
    ```
1. Start an Office application (such as Excel), and then select **File** > **Account**. In the **Product Information** section, select **Update Options** > **Update Now**.  

For switching channels for a large group of users or through System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), [configure the **Update Channel** setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252f9ccf0f13-28ff-4975-9bd2-7e4ea2fefef4#configure-the-update-channel-to-be-used-by-office-365-proplus) by using GPO. After the setting is applied, verify that the **UpdateChannel** and **CDNBaseURL** registry keys are set to the desired update channel's URL. To learn how, see [Change the update channel after you enable Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/sccm/sum/deploy-use/manage-office-365-proplus-updates#change-the-update-channel-after-you-enable-office-365-clients-to-receive-updates-from-configuration-manager).  

Consider using the [ForceAppShutdown](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/configuration-options-for-the-office-2016-deployment-tool#forceappshutdown-property-part-of-property-element) setting in case Office updates are not applied to some users because of opened Office applications.
