# "Access Denied", or user is repeatedly prompted for credentials when connecting to Microsoft 365

## Problem

When users try to access a Microsoft 365 resource from a rich client application such as Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Lync, one of the following symptoms occurs:

- Users receive the **Access Denied** error.

## Solution

To fix this problem, reset the user's password. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser, browse to the Microsoft 365 portal ([https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com/)), and then sign in by using the user's expired credentials.
2. When you're prompted, enter a new Microsoft 365 password for the user. Make sure that the password meets the criteria for Microsoft 365.
