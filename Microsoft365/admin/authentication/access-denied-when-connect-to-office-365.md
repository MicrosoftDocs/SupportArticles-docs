[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem 

When users try to access a Microsoft Office 365 resource from a rich client application such as Microsoft Outlook or Microsoft Lync, one of the following symptoms occurs:

- Users are repeatedly prompted to enter their credentials.   
- Users receive the **Access Denied** error.

## Solution 

To fix this problem, reset the user's password. To do this, follow these steps: 

1. Open a web browser, browse to the Office 365 portal ([https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com/)), and then sign in by using the user's expired credentials.   
2. When you're prompted, enter a new Office 365 password for the user. Make sure that the password meets the criteria for Office 365.
