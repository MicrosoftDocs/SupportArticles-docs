# Deleted app passwords for Multi-Factor Authentication still work in Office 365, Azure, or Intune

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## PROBLEM

After you delete an app password that's used for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, the app password appears to continue to work.

## CAUSE

This problem occurs because the token that's acquired after a user successfully signs in by using an app password continues to work until the token expires. The token works only on devices on which the user successfully signed in.

## SOLUTION

Wait for the token to expire. This may take from 8 to 24 hours, depending on the service that the user is accessing. This practice follows the same guidelines for when passwords are changed or when users are deleted.
