# "One of your on-premises Federation Service certificates is expiring" message in Office 365 portal

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem

You receive the following message in the Microsoft Office 365 portal:

**One of your on-premises Federation Service certificates is expiring. Failure to renew the certificate and update trust properties within 13 days will result in a loss of access to all Office 365 services for all users.**

## Cause 

The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate or the token-signing certificate is about to expire. You may receive this message even if automatic certificate rollover is enabled for the token-signing certificate. 

## Solution 

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Install the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell on the computer (if the module isn't already installed).  
2. Follow the steps in the "Scenario 1: The AD FS token-signing certificate expired" section in ["There was a problem accessing the site" error from AD FS when a federated user signs in to Office 365, Azure, or Intune](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2713898).   
3. Follow the steps in [How to update or repair the settings of a federated domain in Office 365, Azure, or Intune ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2647048).
