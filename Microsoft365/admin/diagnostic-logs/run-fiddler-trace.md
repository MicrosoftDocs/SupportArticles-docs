# How to run (SaRA) Fiddler Trace

## Summary

Fiddler is a third-party (non-Microsoft) web debugging proxy that logs all HTTP(S) traffic between a user's computer and the Internet. It includes a powerful, event-based scripting subsystem (Fiddler Tracer) and can be extended by using any Microsoft .NET language.

## More information

> [!NOTE]
> The Fiddler Trace scenario in SaRA can only be run with the assistance of [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).

1. Go to the [SaRA Assisted Setup](https://aka.ms/SaRA-Assisted).
2. When prompted by your browser, select **Run**.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Selecting the "Microsoft Support Site" link opens the file transfer workspace.
    > - Selecting the "here" link opens the folder that holds the recorded log files.
    > - The log files in Windows are available as %localappdata%\Temp\\<random characters\>\Fiddler_*.saz.  
    > - If the user account that ran the scenario is different from the user account that's logged into Windows, you may receive an error when you select the "here" link. This error indicates that the folder isn't available, because %localappdata% is different in the two accounts. If you receive an error, look in the %localappdata%\Temp\\<random characters\>\ folder for the user account that ran the scenario.

13. On the Microsoft Support Secure File Exchange website, select **Add files** to upload the log files.
