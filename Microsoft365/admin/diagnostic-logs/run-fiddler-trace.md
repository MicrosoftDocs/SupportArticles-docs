# How to run (SaRA) Fiddler Trace

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

Fiddler is a third-party (non-Microsoft) web debugging proxy that logs all HTTP(S) traffic between a user's computer and the Internet. It includes a powerful, event-based scripting subsystem (Fiddler Tracer) and can be extended by using any Microsoft .NET language.

## More Information

> [!NOTE]
> The Fiddler Trace scenario in SaRA can only be run with the assistance of [Microsoft Support](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fcontactus&data=02%7C01%7Cv-todmc%40microsoft.com%7Cd86b09f9921c4eaaf93308d7c55457f8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637194838359073605&sdata=0VX3VHUkV%2BOzj2OKC3%2FOrbnmMs0LAmw%2FMq8lQgiSx7I%3D&reserved=0).
