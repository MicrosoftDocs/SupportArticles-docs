# "Cannot Remove Domain" error when you try to remove a domain from Microsoft 365

## Problem

When you try to remove a domain from Microsoft 365 in the Microsoft 365 portal, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Cannot Remove Domain

<DomainName> can't be removed because you're using it for your SharePoint Online website. If you want to remove the domain, first change the address that you're using for SharePoint Online to a different domain.
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, change the domain that's used for your SharePoint Online website address, and then wait up to 24 hours. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 portal ([https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com)) as a global administrator.   
2. Click **Admin**, and then click **SharePoint**.    
3. On the Site Collections page, click to select the check box next to your public website link, and then click Rename Website.    
4. In the list, select **<your_domain>.sharepoint.com**, and then click **OK**.   
5. Wait 1 hour, and then try to remove the domain. Check back periodically. The process could take as long as 24 hours.
