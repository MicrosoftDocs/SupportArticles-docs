# How to block OneDrive use from within Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Office 2016 applications

## Summary

When you install Microsoft Office 2016, the OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe) is included in the installation package. This article describes how to use Group Policy settings and registry modification to block access to OneDrive from within the Office applications.

## More Information

To block OneDrive access for Office 2016 users in your organization, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Office 2016 Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030).

2. Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings under **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous** as follows:
   1. Set the **Show OneDrive Sign In** setting to **Disabled**.
   2. Enable the **Block signing into Office** setting, and set it to **Org ID only**.

To prevent users from adding their personal OneDrive account, use one of the following methods:

### Use a Group Policy object

Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings.

Under **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous**, configure **Hide file locations when opening or saving files** as **Hide OneDrive Personal**.

> [!NOTE]
> This policy setting only applies to Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.

### Modify the registry

Open the registry editor and browse to the following registry subkey:

`HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Internet`

Modify the DWORD value **OnlineStorage**. The following table lists the predefined values of **OnlineStorage** and the function of each value:

| Value of OnlineStorage | Function of the value |
| -------- | ------- |
|0: This is the default value|Enables all services.|
|1|Disables OneDrive Personal.|
|2|Disables SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business.|
|3|Disables SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and OneDrive Personal.|
|4|Disables This PC.|
|8|Disables SharePoint On-Premises.|
|16|Disables Recent Places.|
|32|Disables SharePoint Online.|
|64|Disables OneDrive for Business.|
|128|Disables all third-party services.|
|4294967295|Disables all optional services.|

To disable multiple services, add up the corresponding values for these services, and set **OnlineStorage** to the resulting value. For example, to disable OneDrive Personal (1), This PC (4), and all third-party services (128), add 1, 4, and 128, and set the value of **OnlineStorage** to 133.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can use any configured Microsoft cloud-based file location to open, save, and share files.
