# How to block OneDrive use from within Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Office 2016 applications

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

When you install Microsoft Office 2016, the OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe) is included in the installation package. This article describes how to use Group Policy settings and registry modification to block access to OneDrive from within the Office applications.

## More Information

To block OneDrive access for Office 2016 users in your organization, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Office 2016 Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030).

2. Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings underÂ **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous** as follows:
   1. Set the **Show OneDrive Sign In** setting to **Disabled**:

    2. Enable the **Block signing into Office** setting, and set it to **Org ID only**:

To prevent users from adding their personal OneDrive account, use one of the following methods:

### Use a Group Policy object
Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings.

Under **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous**, configure **Hide file locations when opening or saving files** as **Hide OneDrive Personal**.

> [!NOTE]
> This policy setting only applies to Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.


### Modify the registry

Open registry editor and browse to the following registry key:

```
HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Internet
```

Modify the DWORD value "OnlineStorage".

Available values are:

* **0** Policy is off (all locations are shown)

* **1** Only OneDrive Personal locations are hidden

* **2** All SharePoint Online locations are hidden

* **3** All Microsoft Online Locations are hidden

If you set other values, the policy is off (all locations are shown).

If the value is set to **1**, uses can no longer see their personal OneDrive location under **Add a place**.
