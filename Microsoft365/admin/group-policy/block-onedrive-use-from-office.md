# How to block OneDrive use from within Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise and Office 2016 applications

## Summary

When you install Microsoft Office 2016, the OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe) is included in the installation package. This article describes how to use Group Policy settings and registry modification to block access to OneDrive from within the Office applications.

## More Information

To block OneDrive access for Office 2016 users in your organization, follow these steps:

1. Download the [Office 2016 Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49030).

2. Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings under **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous** as follows:
   1. Set the **Show OneDrive Sign In** setting to **Disabled**.
   2. Enable the **Block signing into Office** setting, and set it to **Org ID only**.

To prevent users from adding their personal OneDrive account, use one of the following methods:

### Use a Group Policy object
Use the Office 2016 Administrative Templates to configure Group Policy settings.

Under **User configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous**, configure **Hide file locations when opening or saving files** as **Hide OneDrive Personal**.

> [!NOTE]
> This policy setting only applies to Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.


### Modify the registry

Open registry editor and browse to the following registry key:

```
HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Internet
```

Modify the DWORD value "OnlineStorage".

To filter specific services, add the values for all services to be disabled:
```
    1 - OneDrive Personal
    4 - ThisPC
    8 - SharePoint OnPrem
    16 - Recent Places
    32 - SharePoint
    64 - OneDrive for Business
    128 - Third Party Services
```

Special Values:
```
    0 - (Default) All services enabled.
    2 - (Legacy Value) Disable SharePoint and OneDrive for Business.
	4294967295 - All optional services disabled.
```

For example, OneDrive Personal (1), This PC (4) and Third Party Services (128) can all be disabled with a value of 133.

This value is calculated as follows: 1 + 4 + 128 = 133

Common Setting Values:
```
 1 - Disable OneDrive Personal
 2 - Disable SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business
 3 - Disable SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and OneDrive Personal
```

If you disable or donâ€™t configure this policy setting, users can use any configured Microsoft cloud-based file location to open, save, and share files.
