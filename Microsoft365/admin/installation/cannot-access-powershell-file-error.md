# "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file" error when installing Microsoft 365 apps

## Symptoms

When you install Microsoft 365 apps from [Microsoft 365 portal](https://www.office.com/?auth=2) or by using enterprise-level deployment methods, you receive the following error message about the *PowerShell.exe* file:

> Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item.

This error also occurs in the following scenarios:

- Adding language packs or products such as Microsoft Visio or Microsoft Project to your device if Microsoft 365 apps are already installed
- Making online repairs of Microsoft 365 apps
- Uninstalling Microsoft 365 apps

**Important:** If you set [**Display Level**](/deployoffice/office-deployment-tool-configuration-options#display-element) to **None** (Display Level = "None") when you use the Office Deployment Tool, the installation fails without generating an error message or any progress bars.

## Cause

This error occurs for one or both of the following reasons:

- Permissions for PowerShell.exe are restricted or blocked by a policy.
- PowerShell is blocked by your security software.

## Workaround

**Note:** You must have administrator permissions to take the following actions.

To work around this issue, enable *PowerShell.exe* only during the scenario in which the error occurs. After the error is fixed, block or disable *PowerShell.exe* again on the device.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when it becomes available.
