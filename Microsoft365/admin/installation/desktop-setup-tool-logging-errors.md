# Description of Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool logging errors

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2404500

When you try to install updates to client computers by using the Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool, you may encounter errors. When an error occurs, an error message is recorded in the Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool log file. This article describes the error messages that you might receive and the conditions that trigger these errors.

## More information

The Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool log files can be found in the following locations:

- While the Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool is running, you can press Ctrl+Shift+L to package the log files and save them to a location of your choice.
- On a computer that's running Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista, the log file can be found in one of the following locations:
  - C:\Users\<User_Name>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office365\DesktopSetup
  - %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office365\DesktopSetup

To further troubleshoot issues such as updates that couldn't be installed, view the following log files:

- The Application log
- The log files in the Windows Update log folder

When the installation of a required update isn't successful, the failure is logged in the Application log. Events that are related to the Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool contain the following text:

By default, this information is also logged in the Windows Update log. The location of the Windows Update log file is %windir%\WindowsUpdate.log. The Windows Update log file might contain information about why a specific update wasn't installed.

The Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool may also return MSI-specific errors and error codes as a result of the updates that are applied. These aren't errors that are generated by the Microsoft 365 Desktop Setup Tool. These are errors that are generated by the updates. To view the complete list of errors, see [MsiExec.exe and InstMsi.exe Error Messages](/previous-versions//aa368542(v=vs.85)).
