## Cause

Removing a legacy Office product component failed during the transition from an on-premises product to a subscription product, such as M365 Apps for Enterprise.

> [!note]
> This problem occurs only if a legacy product such as Microsoft Office 2007 was installed on the computer and you transitioned from Office 2007 to M365 Apps for Enterprise. 

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, download and install the latest [Office Deployment Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49117) from the Microsoft Download Center, and then continue installing M365 Apps for Enterprise.

   > [!important]
   > Before you use the Office Deployment Tool to download or install Office, we strongly recommend that you make sure that you have the latest version of the tool.
