# No support for multiple Office versions installed on a machine with Remote Desktop Service (RDS)

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

On a computer with Remote Desktop Service (RDS) enabled, it is possible to install multiple versions of Office. However, this is not a supported Office configuration.

To get the computer into a supported configuration, you can either disable RDS or you can uninstall versions of Office, leaving only one version installed.
