# Office LTSC 2021 and Office 2019 perpetual volume license products available as Click-to-Run

For almost two decades, Microsoft Office has relied on the Windows Installer (MSI) technology for core deployment functionality. To better address the ever-growing requirements of businesses, Office has continually introduced modern deployment features.

In Microsoft Office 2013, we introduced Click-to-Run, a modern deployment technology that is now delivering Office to hundreds of millions of users worldwide. Beginning with Microsoft Office 2019, we expanded the availability of Click-to-Run to all client products. Perpetual volume licensed products are now be able to take advantage of benefits that improve security and ease of use while reducing deployment costs. These benefits include the following:

- Predictable cumulative monthly updates
- Software that is up-to-date immediately upon installation
- Easy upgrade path to Microsoft 365 subscription products

Click-to-Run offers the same enterprise-focused management capabilities as MSI-based products. These include volume activation, Group Policy management, administrative control over updates, and integration with management tools such as Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager. To help you migrate from older MSI-based products, Click-to-Run also supports in-place upgrade when you move to Office 2019, Office LTSC 2021, or Microsoft 365 Apps.

Beginning with Office 2019, Office client applications are no longer be available in MSI format. This change in deployment technology does not affect how products are licensed or supported.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: Can I continue to use my older MSI Office products?**

**A:** All previously released products will continue to be supported according to the applicable software lifecycle policy. There is no change to existing products such as Office 2013 or Office 2016.
