# Click-to-Run Update Support Tool for Office

The Click-to-Run Update Support Tool addresses a problem in Office 365 Home, Office 365 Personal, and Office Home & Student 2016 clients. This problem prevents the client from applying any Office updates.  

## How it works

The Update Support Tool, available through Windows Updates, checks the client computer to identify the versions of the Click-to-Run client against the Client-to-Run service. If the version of the service and client do not match, the tool updates the Click-to-Run client to make sure that the client matches the service. A system restart is required for the tool to complete the update process. After completing this process, the Office client can resume to receive the update.
