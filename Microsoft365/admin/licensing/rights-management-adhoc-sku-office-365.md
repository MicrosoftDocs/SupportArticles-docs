## Problem 

In your Office 365 subscription, you see that 50,000 seats are assigned to the RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC SKU. For example, when you run the Get-MsolAccountSku Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell cmdlet, you receive output that resembles the following:

```asciidoc
Windows PowerShell

PS C:\> Connect-MsolService
PS C:\> Get-MsolAccountSku

YourO365:RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC 50000 0 1
YourO365:ENTERPRISEPACK 25 0 7
------------------------------------------------------------- 
```

## Cause 

The RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC entry represents the "Rights Management for individuals" subscription. This is a free offering that anyone in an organization can use after they sign up.

When a person in your organization signs up for this offering, Microsoft allocates 50,000 seats of RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC to your organization. Licenses will be assigned to users only if they sign up. 

The existence of the RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC SKU in your list of SKUs does not affect Microsoft Azure Rights Management functionality or any other Office 365 functionality. Microsoft does not charge for this SKU.

## Solution 

You can safely ignore the RIGHTSMANAGEMENT_ADHOC SKU entry. 

If Azure Rights Management is disabled in your organization, Azure Rights Management functionality will remain disabled. An update will be available in the future to manage this SKU.
