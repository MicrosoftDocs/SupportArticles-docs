# "Can't Verify Subscription" or "No Subscription Found" error messages

## Symptoms

When you use Microsoft 365 Copilot app for iOS, you receive one of the following error messages:  

> Can't Verify Subscription

> Please sign in to reactivate this app.

> No Subscription Found

> We couldn't find a subscription connected to your account.

## Cause

This issue occurs because a previously activated version exists on the device, possibly from another subscription. Therefore, the new Microsoft 365 license can't be applied.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. [Check which Microsoft 365 business product or license](https://support.microsoft.com/office/what-microsoft-365-business-product-or-license-do-i-have-f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd) you have.

   If you're signed in by using your Work or School account, and you don't have a license assigned, [contact your Microsoft 365 administrator](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-do-i-find-my-microsoft-365-admin-59b8e361-dbb6-407f-8ac3-a30889e7b99b) to get a license assigned.

2. Verify the status of the [service health](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-service-health?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
