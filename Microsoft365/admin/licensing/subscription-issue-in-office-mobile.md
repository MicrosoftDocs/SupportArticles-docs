# "Can't Verify Subscription" or "No Subscription Found" error messages in Office Mobile

## Symptoms

When you use Office Mobile for iPhone, you receive one of the following error messages:  

> Can't Verify Subscription

> Please sign in to reactivate this app.

> No Subscription Found

> We couldn't find a subscription connected to your account.

## Cause

This issue occurs because a previously activated version of Office Mobile exists on the device, possibly from another subscription. Therefore, the new Office Professional Plus license cannot be applied.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that you have a license assigned to youin the Microsoft 365 portal. To do this, follow these steps:

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you cannot sign in or do not see the **Settings** button, then you may not have administrative permissions or may not have a license assigned to you.
   1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions).
   2. In the left pane, select **Subscriptions**.

   3. In the list of subscriptions and licenses, scroll down to the **Office 365 \<edition\>** section, and then look for **The latest desktop version of Office**. If you see this entry in the list, you have an Office subscription that's assigned correctly.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't see a vertical scroll bar, hover the pointer over the list, press and hold the left mouse button, and then scroll.

   4. If an entry for **The latest desktop version of Office** does not appear in the list, contact your administrator or go to the following website:

        - [Assign or remove licenses, or view a list of unlicensed users](/office365/admin/subscriptions-and-billing/assign-licenses-to-users?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide)

2. Verify the status of the service health for the Office Subscription service.
