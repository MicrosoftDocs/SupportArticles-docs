## More Information

### How does this change affect me?

If you're an information worker, this change shouldn't affect you. You'll see this change only in the Backstage build version number. This change won't affect the functionality of any application.

If you're an IT Professional or an ISV, this change shouldn't affect any of your manageability tools if those tools have no hardcoded logic that expects to find four-digit build numbers. This expectation also applies to any line-of-business (LOB) applications that may rely on logic that detects build version numbers.

> [!NOTE]
> The major version number in Office binary files remains **16.0**. Therefore, this change doesn't affect registry hive locations or file folder locations.
