# Support limitations for issues with Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise or Microsoft 365 Apps for business

This article describes support limitations for problems when using Microsoft 365 Apps  (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, OneNote, Publisher, and Visio) and you have requested support through the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Microsoft 365 technical support

Microsoft 365 includes technical support. However, Microsoft 365 subscription support has the following limitations for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise or Microsoft 365 Apps for business when purchased individually or as part of a Microsoft 365 service plan.

Microsoft 365 Subscription support primarily covers break-fix issues, which are technical problems you experience while using Microsoft 365 Apps. "Break-fix" is an industry term, which refers to "work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."

Microsoft 365 Subscription support doesn't cover the following issues:

- Customer proposals for product features
- Onsite support
- Root cause analysis (investigation of the cause of the issue)
- Ensuring third-party products or hardware work correctly with Microsoft 365 Apps
- Data recovery
- Writing, reviewing, debugging customer code and developer support for Office Add-ins, Visual Basic for Applications, Microsoft Access, or Publisher
- Extensive troubleshooting of performance issues
- Extensive troubleshooting when a product stops responding or crashes

Customers who desire this level of support should evaluate [Unified Support](https://www.microsoft.com/unifiedsupport/overview).
