# How to troubleshoot issues when you use Cortana with Microsoft 365

## Introduction

This article contains information to help you troubleshoot issues that you could encounter when you use Cortana.

> [!NOTE]
> This document refers primarily to our consumer experiences, which are currently delivered in Windows 10 (version 1909 and earlier) and the Cortana app on iOS and Android.

## More information

**Issue: "Cortana is disabled by company policy" message when you try to enable Cortana from a device that's joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**

When you try to enable Cortana after you sign in to a device that's joined to Azure AD by using a work or school account, you receive the following error message:

- Cortana is disabled by company policy

To enable Cortana from a device that's joined to Azure AD, the Windows 10 November update must be installed.

**Issue: "Your Microsoft 365 settings prevent you from using Cortana" message**

You receive the following error message:

- Your Microsoft 365 settings prevent you from using Cortana. Contact your support person for more information

This issue occurs if Cortana was disabled for your organization.

To resolve this issue, Microsoft 365 administrators can turn on Cortana in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For information about how to do this, see [Cortana for Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/cortana-for-office-365-7257cb50-0d5c-4f7a-ac2e-9fe5d13bb5cb?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

**Issue: "I wasn't able to contact Microsoft 365, but it might work if you try again later" message**

When you try to use Cortana with Microsoft 365, you receive the following message:

- I wasn't able to contact Microsoft 365, but it might work if you try again later.

This error is most likely caused by a network connection failure or time-out.

Wait 5 to 10 minutes, and then try to sign in again.
