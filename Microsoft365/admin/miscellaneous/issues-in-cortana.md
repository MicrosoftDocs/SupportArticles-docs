# How to troubleshoot issues when you use Cortana with Office 365

## Introduction

This article contains information to help you troubleshoot issues that you may encounter when you use Cortana with Microsoft Office 365.

## More information

**Issue: "Cortana is disabled by company policy" message when you try to enable Cortana from a device that's joined to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**

 When you try to enable Cortana after you sign in to a device that's joined to Azure AD by using a work or school account, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Cortana is disabled by company policy  
```

To enable Cortana from a device that's joined to Azure AD, the Windows 10 November update must be installed.

**Issue: "Your Office 365 settings prevent you from using Cortana" message**

You receive the following error message:

```adoc
Your Office 365 settings prevent you from using Cortana. Contact your support person for more information
```

This issue occurs if Cortana was disabled for your organization.

To resolve this issue, Office 365 administrators can turn on Cortana in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For information about how to do this, see [Cortana for Office 365](https://support.office.com/article/cortana-for-office-365-7257cb50-0d5c-4f7a-ac2e-9fe5d13bb5cb?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

**Issue: "I wasn’t able to contact Office 365, but it might work if you try again later" message**

When you try to use Cortana with Office 365, you receive the following message:

```adoc
I wasn’t able to contact Office 365, but it might work if you try again later
```

This error is most likely caused by a network connection failure or time-out.

Wait 5 to 10 minutes, and then try to sign in again.
