# How to open Support cases for GCC High and DoD

## Summary

Microsoft 365 Support is available only to users with Administrator roles associated with a valid email address.  Therefore, only user accounts marked in the Microsoft 365 admin center as an administrator will be able to contact support and/or create a support incident.  Visit your Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your user accounts and define who has permissions to contact support.

If a user does not need any specialized administrative access you can grant them the role of Service Administrator, which will provide them view-only access and the ability to contact support to create an incident.

To create a new service request, browse to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Portal](https://portal.office365.us/adminportal). After login, navigate to **Show all** > **Support** > **New Service Request**, and use the subject to briefly describe the problem for the new service request.

> [!NOTE]
> Users cannot change their own account permissions and their account needs to be updated by another administrator.

For more details and step-by-step guidance on how to assign administrative roles to users, please see [Assign admin roles](/office365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles).

For more details on administrator roles, please see [About admin roles](/office365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).  

For more information on how to populate a valid email address for a user account, see the "More Information" section below.  A valid email address is necessary for the following situations: 

1. You will be informed of support incident progress and updates through email. 
2. Your identity might be challenged/verified through email or a valid phone number listed in your user's properties.
