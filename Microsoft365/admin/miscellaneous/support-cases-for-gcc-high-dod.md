# How to open Support cases for GCC High and DoD

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

Office 365 Support is available only to users with Administrator roles associated with a valid email address.  Therefore, only user accounts marked in the Office 365 admin center as an administrator will be able to contact support and/or create a support incident.  Visit your Office 365 admin center to manage your user accounts and define who has permissions to contact support.  
If a user does not need any specialized administrative access you can grant them the role of Service Administrator, which will provide them view-only access and the ability to contact support to create an incident.  

**Note** Users cannot change their own account permissions and their account needs to be updated by another administrator.

For more details and step-by-step guidance on how to assign administrative roles to users, please see [https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide.](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide)  

For more details on administrator roles, please see [https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).  

For more information on how to populate a valid email address for a user account, see the "More Information" section below.  A valid email address is necessary for the following situations: 

1. You will be informed of support incident progress and updates through email. 
2. Your identity might be challenged/verified through email or a valid phone number listed in your user's properties.
