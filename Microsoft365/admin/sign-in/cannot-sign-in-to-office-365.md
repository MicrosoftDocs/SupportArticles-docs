# "We don't recognize this user ID or password" error when a user tries to sign in to the Office 365 portal

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem 

When users try to sign in to the Office 365 portal, they receive the following error message:

```adoc
We don't recognize this user ID or password

Make sure you typed the user ID assigned to you by your organization. It usually looks like someone@example.com or someone@example.onmicrosoft.com. And check to make sure you typed the correct password.This issue occurs if the wrong user ID or password is entered.
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods, as appropriate for your situation.

### Scenario: Incorrect user ID or password

1. Make sure that the correct user ID is entered.

   **Note** The user ID resembles jsmith@contoso.com or jsmith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com. If you're not sure what your user ID is, contact your administrator.   
2. Make sure that the correct password is entered. 

   **Note** If you're copying and pasting the password, make sure that you don't include spaces before or after the password characters.   

### Scenario: Forgot user ID or password

Click the following article number to go to the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article: 

[A user or an administrator forgot his or her password in Office 365, Azure, or Intune ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2606983)
 
### Scenario: Your organization is using password synchronization together with the Azure Active Directory Sync tool

Do one of the following:
- Have the user change his or her computer password.    
- Reset the computer password for the user. When you reset the user's password, make sure that the **User must change password at next logon**check box isn't selected.   

After Active Directory synchronization occurs, the user's computer password in the on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) environment is synced to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The user can then log on to the computer, and sign in to Office 365 by using the same password.
