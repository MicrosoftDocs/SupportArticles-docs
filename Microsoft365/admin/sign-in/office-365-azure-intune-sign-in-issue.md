## Problem

When a user tries to sign in to a Microsoft cloud service such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune from a sign-in webpage whose URL starts with "https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf," the user receives a sign-in error message and can't sign in.

The following is an example of an error message that the user may receive:

Please try again in a few minutes. If this doesn't work, you might want to contact your admin and report the following error:
