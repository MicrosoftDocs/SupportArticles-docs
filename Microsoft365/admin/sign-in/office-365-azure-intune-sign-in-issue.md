# "Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in" when a user signs in to Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune

## Problem

When a user tries to sign in to a Microsoft cloud service such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune from a sign-in webpage whose URL starts with "https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf," the user receives a sign-in error message and can't sign in.

The following is an example of an error message that the user may receive:

```output
Sorry, but we're having trouble signing you in.

Please try again in a few minutes. If this doesn't work, you might want to contact your admin and report the following error:
<error code>
```

## Solution

To troubleshoot this issue, identify the error code, and then contact technical support. To identify the error code, follow these steps:

1. View the source code of the "login.microsoftonline.com" webpage that shows the error message. 

   For example, in Internet Explorer, press the ALT key to display the menu bar (if it isn't already displayed), and then click **Source** on the **View** menu.
