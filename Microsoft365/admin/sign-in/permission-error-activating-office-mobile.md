# Errors when trying to activate or sign in to Office Mobile on iPhone or Office Mobile on Android

## PROBLEM

When you try to activate or sign in to Office Mobile on iPhone, or Office Mobile on Android, you receive one of the following error messages:

**You don't have permission to access this content**

**We're having trouble locating your account**

This issue occurs if you're using a federated user account and single sign-on (SSO) isn't working.

## SOLUTION

Verify that SSO isn't working or that some other sign-in issue may be occurring. To do this, try to sign in to the [Microsoft 365 portal](https://portal.office.com).

To troubleshoot SSO issues, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

[How to use Remote Connectivity Analyzer to troubleshoot single sign-on issues for Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2650717)

To troubleshoot other sign-in issues, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

[You can't sign in to Microsoft 365, Azure, or Intune](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2412085)
