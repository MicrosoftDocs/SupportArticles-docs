# Errors when trying to activate or sign in to Office Mobile on iPhone or Office Mobile on Android

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## PROBLEM

When you try to activate or sign in to Office Mobile on iPhone, available in the Apple iTunes Store as "Office Mobile for Office 365 subscribers," or Office Mobile on Android, available in the Google Play store as "Office Mobile for Office 365," you receive one of the following error messages:

**You don't have permission to access this content**

**We're having trouble locating your account**

This issue occurs if you're using a federated user account and single sign-on (SSO) isn't working.

## SOLUTION

Verify that SSO isn't working or that some other sign-in issue may be occurring. To do this, try to sign in to the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com).

To troubleshoot SSO issues, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

[How to use Remote Connectivity Analyzer to troubleshoot single sign-on issues for Office 365, Azure, or Intune](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2650717)

To troubleshoot other sign-in issues, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

[You can't sign in to Office 365, Azure, or Intune](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2412085)
