## Cause

This issue occurs if one of the following conditions is true:

- An issue occurred during the attempt to connect to services that are used by Office Professional Plus.

## Solution

To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant is installed on the computer. To do this, open Control Panel, and then in the **Add or Remove Programs** or **Programs and Features** tool, verify that Office Professional Plus is in the list of installed programs.

    1. Click Start, click Run, type services.msc, and then click OK.

        If the service isn't started, click Start, click Automatic in the **Startup type** box, and then click OK.
