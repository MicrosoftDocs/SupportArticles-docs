# Can't sign in to an Office 2016 for Mac app

## Problem

When you try to sign in to an Office 2016 for Mac app by using your Microsoft 365 user ID and password, you receive the following error message:

> Sorry, another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use the Keychain Access app to delete any password entries that contain "Office." To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the Keychain Access app.
1. In the Search field, type Office.
1. Delete any entries that are found.
   > [!NOTE]
   > You should find between two and six entries.
1. Exit the Keychain Access app, and then try to sign in to Office 2016 for Mac again.

## More information

This behavior is expected. It occurs if you're already signed in to Office 2016 for Mac through a different Microsoft 365 user account in the same organization.
