You can't sign in to Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune. You might be trying to sign in by using a portal such as [https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/). Or, you might be trying to sign in by using a non-browser–based app, such as one of the following: 

- Office apps, such as Outlook, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint    
- Office apps on mobile devices, such as Office Mobile, Teams, and Microsoft OneDrive for Business (formerly Microsoft SkyDrive Pro)
- Azure Active Directory Sync    
- Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell    
- Dynamics CRM    
  
## Cause

The following conditions might cause this issue: 
 
- Your subscription has expired.    
- Your user account is not enabled.    
- You're locked out from your user account.    
- You tried to sign in with the wrong user name and password.    
- The password you tried to sign in with is temporary and expired. (This might happen if your user account is new or your password was recently reset.)    
- Your password has expired.    
- You're blocked from signing in.    
- If you're a federated user, single sign-on is not working.    

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps. 

### Step 1: Sign in to the portal

- If you're using Office 365 or CRM Online, go to [https://portal.office.com](https://portal.office.com/).    
- If you're using Azure, go to [https://manage.windowsazure.com/?whr=azure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com/?whr=azure.com).    
- If you're using Intune, go to [https://manage.microsoft.com](https://manage.microsoft.com).    
 
### Step 2: Use the solution that's appropriate for your sign-in experience
  
#### You can sign in to the portal

If you can sign in to the portal, but you can't sign in to a non-browser–based app, such as an Office app or an app on your mobile device to check email, follow these steps: 
 
1. Work with your admin to make sure that you have the correct licenses applied to your account.    
2. If you're enabled for multi-factor authentication, make sure that you have set up app passwords. For more information about multi-factor authentication, see [Manage your settings for two-step verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-manage-settings).    
3. If you use a mail app such as Outlook, and if you're a federated user, see [Federated users can't connect to an Exchange Online mailbox](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2466333).      
4.
