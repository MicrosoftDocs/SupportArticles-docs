# "Unable to reset this user's password" when an admin resets the password of a domain member user

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Problem

Consider the following scenario: A user can't sign in to a Microsoft cloud service such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune by using a user ID that's a member of a cloud service domain that was formerly set up for single sign-on (SSO). In this scenario, when a cloud service admin tries to reset the user's password by using the cloud service portal or Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell, the administrator receives the following error message:

**Unable to reset this user's password. Try again later.**

## Cause 

This issue occurs if the user is a member of a cloud service domain that was formerly single sign-on (SSO)-enabled and if the user ID wasn't converted to use standard authentication.

For example, this issue can occur if the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet was used:

```powershell
convert-MSOLDomainToStandard –skipuserconversion:$true 
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, convert the user ID to a standard (non-federated) type. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the same Windows PowerShell console that you used to verify the issue, type the following cmdlet, and then press Enter:
   ```powershell
   Convert-MsolFederatedUser -userprincipalname < user ID > 
   ```
   > [!NOTE]
   > In this cmdlet, the placeholder <**user ID**> represents the user ID.
1. Give the user a temporary password. The next time that the user signs in to the cloud service, they have to change their temporary password before they can access cloud service resources.   

## More information

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows PowerShell cmdlets in this article require the Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell.
