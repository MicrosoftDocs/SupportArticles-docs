# You can't activate or sign-in after you update to Office 2016 for Mac version 15.33

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to activate or sign in to any of the Microsoft Office 2016 applications after you install the version 15.33 update, you receive a blank authentication screen.
  
Additionally, you may see any of the following symptoms. 
### Symptom 1

The following issues occur in the Unified Logging Service (ULS) log:  
 
- The server has redirected to a non-https URL.    
- Errors occur in Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) authentication.    
 
To locate the ULS log, open **Finder** and browse to the following path:
 
    ~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.<Application>/Data/Library/Caches/Microsoft/uls/com.microsoft.<Application>/logs 

**Note** \<Application> represents the name of the application that you are troubleshooting. 
### Symptom 2

You notice that in an HTTP trace, the server response includes multiple WWW-Authenticate headers, such as the following:
 
    WWW-Authenticate: Negotiate

    WWW-Authenticate: NTLM 

## Cause

The symptoms occur for the following corresponding reasons:  
#### Cause for symptom 1

Starting from Office 2016 for Mac version 15.33, unsecured endpoint traffic is blocked in authentication flows. 
#### Cause for symptom 2

Starting from Office 2016 for Mac version 15.33, the authentication method no longer selects NTLM authentication when multiple WWW-Authenticate headers are present in the response. The issue occurs when the selected authentication method is unsuccessful.  

## Resolution

### Resolution for symptom 1

Configure all authentication endpoints to use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. 
### Resolution for symptom 2

Install the [September 2017 update for Office 2016 for Mac version 15.38](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=525133). 

## More Information

### More information for symptom 1

The resolution applies when you use Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services or non-Microsoft federation solutions.
