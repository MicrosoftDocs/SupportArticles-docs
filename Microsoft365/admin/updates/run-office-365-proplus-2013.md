[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

> [!NOTE]
> Support for this family of products will end in early 2017. For more information, see [Support for the 2013 version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise ends February 28, 2017](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3199744).  

To prevent Microsoft Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise from being automatically updated to Office 2016 over the Internet, use one of the methods in the "Resolution" section. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Apply one of these methods only on installations of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise that are configured to automatically receive monthly updates over the Internet. If you've configured Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise to receive updates from a location on your internal network, or if you've turned off automatic updates, you don't have to use these methods, because you control when the update to Office 2016 occurs.

We've enhanced the upgrade and installation experience, and for Office 365 subscribers we've made changes to how Office 2016 apps will be updated from this point forward. We're also delivering new tools and resources to help you prepare, deploy, and manage Office.

## Resolution

There are two ways to prevent Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise from updating to Office 2016. Use the method that works best for your organization. 

> [!NOTE]
> - These methods also work for Office 365 Business, which is the version of Office that comes with the Office 365 Business and Office 365 Business Premium plans.
> - Prior to implementing either Method 1 or 2 below, ensure that you have the latest Office 2013 updates installed. 

### Method 1: Use Group Policy templates

Use the Enable Automatic Upgrade Group Policy setting that's included in the Office 2013 Group Policy Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML), which you can download from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=35554). This policy setting is located under Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2013 (Machine)\Updates. Select Disabled.
