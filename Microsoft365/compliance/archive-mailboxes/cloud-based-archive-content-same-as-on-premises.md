# Contents of cloud-based archive are the same as contents of on-premises primary mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2987546

## Problem

Assume that you have a hybrid deployment of on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server and Exchange Online in Microsoft 365. When you view the cloud-based archive mailbox of a user, archived items are not displayed. Instead, the contents of the cloud-based archive mailbox are the same as the contents of the user's on-premises primary mailbox.

## Cause

This issue may occur if the user principal name (UPN) of the user's on-premises Exchange mailbox has a suffix that makes it differ from the UPN of the archive mailbox. For example, this issue may occur if the UPN of the user's on-premises mailbox is *joe@contoso.com* and the UPN of the user's archive mailbox is *joe@contoso1.com*.

This issue may also occur if your on-premises Exchange organization isn't federated with Exchange Online correctly.

## Solution

Make sure that your on-premises Exchange organization is correctly federated with Exchange Online. For more info, see [Configure a federation trust](/exchange/configure-a-federation-trust-exchange-2013-help).
