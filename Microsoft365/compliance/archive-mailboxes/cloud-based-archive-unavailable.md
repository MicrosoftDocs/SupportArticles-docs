# "Your archive appears to be unavailable" error when you try to access a cloud-based archive mailbox in a hybrid deployment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2860302

> [!NOTE]
> The Hybrid Configuration wizard that's included in the Exchange Management Console in Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is no longer supported. Therefore, you should no longer use the old Hybrid Configuration wizard. Instead, use the Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard that's available at [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard](https://aka.ms/hybridwizard). For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Hybrid Configuration wizard for Exchange 2010](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/office-365-hybrid-configuration-wizard-for-exchange-2010/ba-p/604541).

## Problem

A user experiences the following symptoms in a hybrid deployment of on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange Online in Microsoft 365:

- When the user tries to access a cloud-based archive mailbox by using Outlook Web App, the user receives the following error message:

   > Your archive appears to be unavailable. Try to access it again in 10 seconds. If you see this error again, contact your Help Desk.

- When the user tries to access the cloud-based archive mailbox by using Microsoft Outlook, the archive mailbox may be present in the profile. However, the user can't update the archive mailbox.

## Cause

This issue may occur if the root certificates on the Exchange hybrid server are missing or corrupted. These certificates are used to validate your on-premises Exchange environment.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, update the root certificates, and then rerun the Hybrid Configuration Wizard on the hybrid server. To do this, follow these steps.

These steps must be completed by a Microsoft 365 administrator. If you are a user who is experiencing this issue, contact your administrator to resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Update the root certificates

To update the root certificates, run Windows Update on the Exchange hybrid server.

For more information about how to update root certificates for a particular version of Windows or about how to use Group Policy to distribute updates, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

### Step 2: Rerun the Hybrid Configuration Wizard

Rerun the Hybrid Configuration Wizard to update the deployment and resolve the issue. For more information about how to run the Hybrid Configuration Wizard, go to the following Microsoft websites:
