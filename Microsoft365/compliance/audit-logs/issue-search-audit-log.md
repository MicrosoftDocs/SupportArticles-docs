# "Your request couldn't be completed. Please try again" error when you try to search the audit log in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_&nbsp;3193501

## Problem

When a user tries to search the audit log in the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, the user receives the following error message:

> Your request couldn't be completed. Please try again, and if the problem persists, contact your administrator.

## Cause

1. Open the Exchange admin center. For more information, see [Exchange admin center in Exchange Online](/exchange/exchange-admin-center).
2. Select **Permission** > **admin role**, and then select **New** (:::image type="icon" source="media/issue-search-audit-log/add-button.png":::) to create a new role group.
3. On the 'New role group' page:
   1. Specify a name for the role group.
   1. In the **Role** box, select **Add** (:::image type="icon" source="media/issue-search-audit-log/add-button.png":::), add the **View-Only Audit Log** or **Audit Log** role, and then select **OK**.
   1. In the **Member** box, select **Add** (:::image type="icon" source="media/issue-search-audit-log/add-button.png":::), add the user, and then select **Save**.
