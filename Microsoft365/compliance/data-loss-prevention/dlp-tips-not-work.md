## Symptoms

Policy tips for unified data loss prevention (DLP) policies that are created in Office 365 Security and Compliance Center don't work in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Web App (OWA).

- Exchange Online

## Resolution

To view unified DLP policy tips, use one of the following options in Exchange Online:

- Disable all Transport rules that include the **Notify the sender with a Policy Tip** action.
- Remove the action **Notify the sender with a Policy Tip**  from all Transport rules.
