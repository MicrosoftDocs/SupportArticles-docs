# You can't search inactive mailboxes in Exchange Online

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2898413

## Problem

You want to use In-Place eDiscovery to search the contents of inactive mailboxes in your Microsoft Exchange Online organization. However, after you select **Specify mailboxes to search** on the Mailboxes page of the Exchange admin center, no inactive mailboxes are listed.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the Microsoft 365 user account that you're using to search is a member of the Discovery Management role group but is not a member of the Organization Management role group.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, add the View-Only Recipients role to the Discovery Management role group.

## Status

This is a known issue. Microsoft is working to address the issue and will post more information in this article when it becomes available.
