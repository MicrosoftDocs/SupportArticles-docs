# You can't start the eDiscovery PST Export Tool from the Exchange admin center in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

_Original KB number:_&nbsp;2919825

## Problem

Consider the following scenario. In Microsoft Exchange Online, you create an eDiscovery mailbox search in the Exchange admin center. You're then ready to export the search results to a PST file. You click **Export to a PST file**, and then you're prompted to install the eDiscovery PST Export Tool. However, after you install and start the eDiscovery PST Export Tool, you experience one of the following symptoms:

- If you're using Windows Internet Explorer 9.0 or later, the application tries to connect but then crashes without displaying an error message.
- If you're using a third-party browser, you receive the following error message:
  > Cannot Download the application. The application is missing required files. Contact application vendor for assistance.

## Cause

This issue may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:

- You're using Internet Explorer 9.0 or later, and you don't have the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or later installed.
- Local intranet zone settings aren't set up correctly in Internet Explorer.
- You're using a third-party browser, and you don't have the ClickOnce browser extension installed.
- You're using an outgoing proxy server, and the connection times out.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, do one or more of the following, as appropriate for your situation.

### Scenario 1: You're using Internet Explorer 9.0 or later, and you don't have the .NET Framework 4.5 or later installed

[Install the .NET Framework 4.5 or a later version](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

### Scenario 2: Local intranet zone settings aren't set up correctly in Internet Explorer

Make sure that `https://*.outlook.com`Â is added to the Local intranet zone in Internet Explorer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tool** menu.
1. On the **Security** tab, select **Local intranet**.
1. Click **Site**, and then click **Advanced**.
1. Add `https://*.outlook.com` (if it's not already listed).
1. Click **Close**.

Additionally, make sure that the following URLs are not listed as Trusted zone sites:

- `https://*.outlook.com`
- `https://r4.res.outlook.com`
- `https://*.res.outlook.com`

### Scenario 3: You're using a third-party (non-Microsoft) browser, and you don't have the ClickOnce browser extension installed

Install the ClickOnce extension. The extension can be found on the add-on webpage for that browser.

- For Mozilla Firefox: [Firefox browser add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/extensions/?sort=featured)
- For Google Chrome: [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps)

### Scenario 4: You're using an outgoing proxy server, and the connection times out

Use the `netsh` command-line tool to open port 8080 on the proxy server. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt window, and then run the following command:

   ```powershell
   netsh winhttp show proxy
   ```

2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   netsh winhttp set proxy proxyservername:8080
   ```

   For example:

   ```powershell
   netsh winhttp set proxy proxy.contoso.com:8080
   ```
