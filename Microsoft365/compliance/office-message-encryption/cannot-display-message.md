# "We can't display your message right now" error in Outlook Web App when an Exchange Online user views an encrypted message

_Original KB number:_&nbsp;2971787

## Problem

When a Microsoft Exchange Online user tries to read a message that was encrypted by Microsoft Purview Message Encryption in Microsoft Outlook Web App, the user receives the following error message:
We can't display your message right now.
This issue occurs even if the user can send encrypted messages from Outlook Web App.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the MIME types that are associated with the default Outlook Web App policy changed so that the text/html MIME type was removed or changed.

## Solution

To resolve this problem, reset the MIME types that are associated with the default Outlook Web App policy to the default values. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Connect to Exchange Online by using remote PowerShell. For more information about how to do this, see [Connect to Exchange Online Using Remote PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    $owapolicy = Get-OwaMailboxPolicy
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    Set-OwaMailboxPolicy -AllowedMimeTypes @{remove = "text/html"} -BlockedMimeTypes @{remove = "text/html"} -ForceSaveMimeTypes @{add = "text/html"} -Identity $owapolicy.Identity
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > It may take as long as 30 minutes for the changes to take effect.
