# Auto-apply retention label doesn't apply to items in a mailbox

## Symptoms

You configure an [auto-apply retention label](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-retention-labels-automatically) by using a query that contains specific words, phrases, or values of searchable properties. However, the label doesn't automatically apply to the items in a user's mailbox in your organization.

## Cause

This issue occurs for one or both of the following reasons:

- The user applied a personal tag to the items that should be auto-labeled or to folders that contain the items that should be auto-labeled.
- A messaging records management (MRM) policy applied a retention policy tag to folders that contain the items to be auto-labeled.

## Resolution

If the user applied a personal tag to the items or to folders that contain the items, remove the personal tag.

If an MRM policy applied a retention policy tag to folders that contain the items, [remove the retention policy tag](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/add-or-remove-retention-tags) from the MRM retention policy.
