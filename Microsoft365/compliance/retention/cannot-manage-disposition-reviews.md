# "(401) Rbac check failed" error when trying to manage disposition reviews

## Symptoms

When you use the **Disposition** tab in **Microsoft Purview Records Management** in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal to manage [disposition reviews](/microsoft-365/compliance/disposition), you receive the following error message:

> The remote server returned an error: (401) Rbac check failed.

## Cause

This error occurs if you don't have sufficient permission for disposition reviews, and the role-based access control (RBAC) check fails. Permissions in the compliance portal are based on the RBAC permissions model.

## Resolution

Verify that the error is caused by the failure of the RBAC check. To do so, reproduce the issue, and [capture the associated network activity logs](/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/network/#log-network-activity) from Microsoft Edge. Then, check the network logs for the RBAC "401" error message.

If you see the error message, make sure that either you or the group that you belong to is part of the following role groups:

- Content Explorer Content Viewer
- Content Explorer List Viewer
- Microsoft Purview Records Management with the Disposition Management role
