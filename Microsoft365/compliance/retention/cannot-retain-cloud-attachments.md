# Can't retain cloud attachments

Microsoft Purview provides tools that admins can use to retain cloud attachments that users share through Teams and Outlook. If you've configured cloud attachments to be retained, but you can't find them by using eDiscovery, it might be that the items weren't actually cloud attachments but separate copies or shared by using other mechanisms. Use the following table to identify which sharing mechanisms are cloud attachments in Outlook, Teams, and Yammer.

For information about how to retain cloud attachments that are shared in Outlook, Teams, and Yammer and known limitations for this scenario, see the retention label condition for cloud attachments in [Automatically apply a retention label to retain or delete content](/microsoft-365/compliance/apply-retention-labels-automatically).
