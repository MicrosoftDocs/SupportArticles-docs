# Messaging Records Management (MRM) and Retention Policies in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_&nbsp;4032361

## Summary

Microsoft 365 provides a default **retention policy** (also known as **Default MRM Policy**). To check for these policies in your environment, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-RetentionPolicy | fl Name
```  

For example, the output of this cmdlet resembles the following:

```console
Name : Default MRM Policy
Name : Contoso-Default-Retention-Policy
```

To see which policy is set on a mailbox, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-mailbox <SMTP> | fl RetentionPolicy
```

For example, the output of this cmdlet resembles the following:

```console
RetentionPolicy: Contoso-Default-Retention-Policy
```

To change or set a retention policy for a user, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-Mailbox <SMTP> -RetentionPolicy "Contoso-Default-Retention-Policy"
```

To view the **retention policy tags**  that are associated with the plan, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
(Get-RetentionPolicy "Contoso-Default-Retention-Policy").RetentionPolicyTagLinks | Format-Table name
```

The output of this cmdlet resembles the following:

```console
Name
----
1 Month Delete
1 Year Delete
3 Year Delete
6 Month Delete
Never Delete
Voice Mail Deletion
1 Week Archive
1 Month Archive
1 Year Archive
Never Archive
2 Year Archive
3 Month Archive
6 Month Archive
3 Year Archive
```

To view the details for a specific **retention policy tag**, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-RetentionPolicyTag "1 Week Delete" | Format-list Name,Type,AgeLimitForRetention,MessageClass,RetentionAction
```

The output of this cmdlet resembles the following:

```console
Name : 1 Week Delete
Type : Personal
AgeLimitForRetention : 7.00:00:00
MessageClass : *
RetentionAction : DeleteAndAllowRecovery
```

To view the details for all **retention policy tag**, run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-RetentionPolicyTag | Format-Table Name,Type,AgeLimitForRetention,MessageClass,RetentionAction
```

The output of this cmdlet resembles the following:

```console
 Name Type AgeLimitForRetention MessageClass RetentionAction
---- ---- -------------------- ------------ ---------------
1 Week Delete Personal 7.00:00:00 * DeleteAndAllowRecovery
1 Month Delete Personal 30.00:00:00 * DeleteAndAllowRecovery6 Month Delete Personal 180.00:00:00 * DeleteAndAllowRecovery1 Year Delete Personal 365.00:00:00 * DeleteAndAllowRecoveryNever Delete Personal * DeleteAndAllowRecovery ...
```

If a retention policy is not working as expected, review the following articles first to make sure that you understand how the policy processes items in your mailbox.

- Issue: Items are not expiring as expected.

**Retention tags** are used to apply retention settings to messages and folders in user mailboxes. There are three types of retention tags:

- **Default policy tag (DPT)** is a retention tag that applies to all items in a mailbox that doesn't already have a retention tag applied. You can have only one DPT in a retention policy.
- **Retention policy tag (RPT)** is a retention tag that applies to default folders, such as Inbox and Deleted Items.
- **Personal tag** is used to make retention settings to custom folders and individual items, such as email messages. It is available to Outlook Web App, Outlook 2010, and later versions.
