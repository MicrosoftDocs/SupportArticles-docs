For information about how to identify retention policy errors, see [Identify errors in Microsoft 365 retention and retention label policies](identify-errors-in-retention-and-retention-label-policies.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Purview doesn't support policies that contain errors. You must first resolve all policy errors. Otherwise, retention and retention label policies might not function as intended.

## Error: Settings not found

### Symptoms

When you check the details pane for a retention policy in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you see the error message, "Settings not found."

### Cause

Your retention policy has no retention rules.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods.

#### Method 1: Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), search for the policy on the following tabs:

   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Retention policies**
   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Label policies**
   - **Records Management** \> **Label policies**

2. Select the policy, and then select **Edit**.

3. In **Retention settings**, add [rules](/microsoft-365/compliance/retention-settings#settings-for-retaining-and-deleting-content) to your retention policy.

#### Method 2: Use PowerShell

1. [Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

2. Use the applicable cmdlet for your workload to add rules to your retention policy.

   Use the [New-RetentionComplianceRule](/powershell/module/exchange/new-retentioncompliancerule) cmdlet for policies that target:

   - Microsoft Exchange Online email
   - Microsoft SharePoint sites
   - Microsoft OneDrive accounts
   - Microsoft 365 Groups
   - Microsoft Skype for Business conversations
   - Exchange Online public folders
   - Microsoft Teams chat messages
   - Teams channel messages

   For example, to add a rule that specifies an unlimited retention period, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   New-RetentionComplianceRule -Name "<new rule name>" -Policy "<existing policy name>" -RetentionDuration Unlimited
   ```

   Use the [New-AppRetentionComplianceRule](/powershell/module/exchange/new-appretentioncompliancerule) cmdlet for policies that target:

   - Teams private channel messages
   - Microsoft Viva Engage user messages
   - Viva Engage community messages

   For example, to add a rule that specifies an unlimited retention period, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   New-AppRetentionComplianceRule -Name "<new rule name>" -Policy "<existing policy name>" -RetentionDuration Unlimited
   ```

## Error: Something went wrong

### Symptoms

When you check the details pane for a policy in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you see the error message, "Something went wrong."

If you run the following command, you see `PolicyNotifyError` in the value that's returned by the `DistributionResults` property:

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<policy name>" -DistributionDetail | Select -ExpandProperty DistributionResults
```

### Cause

An unspecified error occurred in the notification pipeline of the policy sync and distribution process.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods. If you use method 1, check for additional resolution options in the policy details pane.

#### Method 1: Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), search for the policy on the following tabs:

   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Retention policies**
   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Label policies**
   - **Records Management** \> **Label policies**

2. Select the policy to open the policy details pane. Make sure that you select the policy name and not the corresponding checkbox. Otherwise, the details pane won't open.

3. In the policy details pane, select **Retry**. The policy enters a pending state until policy sync and distribution finishes.

#### Method 2: Use PowerShell

1. [Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

2. Retry policy sync and distribution. Use the [Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy) cmdlet together with the `RetryDistribution` switch to redeploy the policy:

   ```powershell
   Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<policy name>" -RetryDistribution
   ```

## Error: The location is ambiguous

### Symptoms

When you check the details pane for a policy in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, you see the error message, "The location is ambiguous."

If you run the following command, you see `MultipleInactiveRecipientsError` in the value that's returned by the `DistributionResults` property:

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<policy name>" -DistributionDetail | Select -ExpandProperty DistributionResults
```

### Cause

The system returned more than one result for the specified location. For the system to apply a policy, each applicable location must have one match.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods. If you use method 1, check for additional resolution options in the policy details pane that opens when you select the policy name.

#### Method 1: Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

1. In the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/), search for the policy on the following tabs:

   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Retention policies**
   - **Data Lifecycle Management** \> **Microsoft 365** \> **Label policies**
   - **Records Management** \> **Label policies**

2. Select the policy, and then select **Edit**.

3. Remove the duplicate locations from the policy.

#### Method 2: Use PowerShell

1. [Connect to Security & Compliance PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-scc-powershell).

2. Remove the duplicate locations from the policy by using the [Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy) cmdlet. For example, to remove an Exchange location use the `RemoveExchangeLocation` switch.

3. Retry policy sync and distribution. Use the [Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/set-retentioncompliancepolicy) cmdlet together with the `RetryDistribution` switch to redeploy the policy:

   ```powershell
   Set-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<policy name>" -RetryDistribution

```powershell
Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy -Identity "<policy name>" -DistributionDetail | Select -ExpandProperty DistributionResults
```

### Cause

The location doesn't have enough available storage for the system to apply your policy or policy update.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods. If you use method 1, check for additional resolution options in the policy details pane.

#### Method 1: Use the Microsoft Purview compliance portal

1. Increase the storage quota for the specified location. Contact the site administrator or global SharePoint administrator to manage the quota for the location. You can also delete unnecessary items to increase available storage.
