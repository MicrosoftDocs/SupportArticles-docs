# Resolve email archive and deletion issues when using retention policies

This article explores some common issues that prevent messaging records management (MRM) from correctly deleting or archiving email messages in Exchange Online. It also provides steps to identify the root cause and resolve the issues.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - These troubleshooting steps also apply to Exchange hybrid deployments in which the primary mailbox is hosted on-premises and the archive mailbox is in Exchange Online. In such deployments, perform these steps by using the on-premises Exchange Management Shell.
> - In Exchange Online, the Managed Folder Assistant (MFA) is set to process mailboxes at least one time every seven days. Although MFA usually processes mailboxes every day, the process can take up to seven days to finish. Instead of waiting for the process to run, you can force it by running the `Start-ManagedFolderAssistant <mailbox ID>` cmdlet.
> - MRM doesn't process mailboxes that are smaller than 10 MB.
> - If the account is disabled and the mailbox type is regular, then MRM won't process the mailbox. Therefore, any subsequent holds applied won't show up in the Hold Tracking Mailbox Diagnostic logs.

## Common causes

There are several reasons why MRM might not process a mailbox as expected. For example:

- The mailbox is placed on retention hold. That is, the *RetentionHoldEnabled* property of the mailbox is set to **True**. For example, the mailbox is migrated by using the PST Import service.
- The *ElcProcessingDisabled* property of the mailbox is set to **True**. This setting prevents the MFA from processing the mailbox at all.
- The mailbox has a retention tag applied, but the tag is currently disabled. Therefore, messages in the mailbox will never be archived or deleted.
- The mailbox to be processed is large and contains many items. This can cause MFA to archive or delete content at a slower rate.
- The retention policy that's applied to the mailbox includes only personal tags. If the user doesn't manually apply these tags, MRM might not process the mailbox.

## Troubleshooting

### Check the RetentionHoldEnabled property of the mailbox

Use the [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) cmdlet to retrieve the *RetentionHoldEnabled* property of the mailbox. If the property is set to **True**, set it to **False**.

### Check the ElcProcessingDisabled property of the mailbox

Use the [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) cmdlet to retrieve the *ElcProcessingDisabled* property of the mailbox. If the property is set to **True**, set it to **False**. For more information about this property, see [Difference between ElcProcessingDisabled and RetentionHoldEnabled](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/mailbox-retention-hold#difference-between-elcprocessingdisabled-and-retentionholdenabled).

### Review the retention policies and tags that are applied to the mailbox

Use the [Get-RetentionPolicyTag](/powershell/module/exchange/get-retentionpolicytag?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true), [Get-RetentionPolicy](/powershell/module/exchange/get-retentionpolicy?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true) and [Get-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) cmdlets to check retention policies and tags that are assigned to the affected mailbox.

Here are some examples:

- To retrieve all retention policies on your Exchange Online tenant, run the following cmdlet:

  ```powershell
  Get-RetentionPolicy
  ```

- To check which policy tags are added to the MRM policy that's assigned to the mailbox, run the following cmdlet:

  ```powershell
  Get-RetentionPolicy -Identity <Name of the retention policy assigned to the mailbox> | select -ExpandProperty RetentionPolicyTagLinks
  ```

- To retrieve the *RetentionHoldEnabled* property of the mailbox and the assigned retention policy, run the following cmdlet:

  ```powershell
  Get-Mailbox <MailboxID> | fl *Retention*
  ```

- To check which personal retention tags the user has opted into in addition to those that are already included in the assigned retention policy, run the following cmdlet:

  ```powershell
  Get-RetentionPolicyTag -Mailbox <MailboxID> -OptionalInMailbox
  ```

- To review the details of a particular retention policy tag, run the following cmdlet:

  ```powershell
  Get-RetentionPolicyTag <Name of the tag> | fl
  ```

Pay attention to retention tags that are disabled or that have the actions set to *never move to archive* or *never delete*. The duration that's assigned to a tag is a key factor in determining its priority. Therefore, check for tags that have the longest time duration, such as *never move to archive* or *never delete*, because these tags take precedence over other tags that are applied.

> [!NOTE]
> The default archive policy tag that applies to the whole mailbox also applies to Calendar, Tasks, and Notes. You can't apply a personal archive tag that has the *never move to archive* action to these folders. Exception: You can apply tags to Notes by using Outlook on the web. For more information, see [Default folders that support Retention Policy Tags](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/default-folders).

### Check for Default Archive and Default Retention on the mailbox

Check whether a Default Archive or Default Retention policy tag is applied to the mailbox. If it is, make sure that:

- No personal archive or retention tags have been previously applied to folders that have the *never move to archive* or *never delete* action.
- No disabled or default archive or retention tags have been applied to the entire mailbox.
- The Default Archive tag (or any other policy tags that was applied) exists in the list of retention policy tags that are contained in the PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM property. If any tag is missing, delete the IPM.Configuration.MRM message that contains the PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM property, and use the [Start-ManagedFolderAssistant](/powershell/module/exchange/start-managedfolderassistant) cmdlet together with the `-FullCrawl` switch for the affected mailbox. Doing this regenerates the IPM.Configuration.MRM hidden message and updates the PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM to have the new policy tag.

You can use MFCMAPI to check the PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM property by following these steps:

1. Set up the affected mailbox in Outlook.
2. Download [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases). If you use the 64-bit version of Outlook, download the 64-bit build. Otherwise, download the 32-bit build.
3. Open MFCMAPI, select **Tools** > **Options**, and then select **MAPI_NO_CACHE** and **MDB_ONLINE**.
4. Select **Session** > **Logon**, select the profile that contains the affected mailbox, and then select **OK**.
5. Double-click the affected mailbox, expand **Root Container** > **Top of Information Store**.
6. Under **Top of Information Store** (or its equivalent if the user mailbox is set to a language other than English), right-click **Inbox**, and then select **Open associated contents table**.
7. Sort the top pane by the **Message Class** column, and then select **IPM.Configuration.MRM**.
8. In the bottom pane, sort by the **Name** column, and then locate the **PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM** property.
9. Double-click **PR_ROAMING_XMLSTREAM**, copy the XML in the **Text** section, paste it into Notepad, and then save the contents as an .xml file.
10. Open the .xml file in a web browser to see the actual retention policy tags that are applied to the mailbox.

### Check for personal tags applied to folders or individual items

You can also use MFCMAPI to check whether personal archive or retention tags are correctly applied to folders. To do this, use similar steps that are mentioned above, select the affected folder, and check its properties for archive tags or retention tags. You can do this for individual email messages, too.
 
If you're dealing with a Default Archive policy that applies to the entire mailbox, you won't see any archive policy properties, such as:

- PR_ARCHIVE_TAG
- PR_ARCHIVE_PERIOD
- PR_ARCHIVE_DATE
- PR_POLICY_TAG
- PR_RETENTION_DATE

These properties are visible only if a personal archive tag, default folder retention tag, or personal retention tag is applied.

### Collect the primary mailbox and archive mailbox folder statistics

To gather information about the oldest items and policies that are applied, run the following commands:

- For the primary mailbox:

  ```powershell
  Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity <primary mailbox ID> -IncludeOldestAndNewestItems | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation -Path .\primaryfolderstats.csv
  ```

- For the archive mailbox:

  ```powershell
  Get-MailboxFolderStatistics -Identity  <primary mailbox ID> -Archive -IncludeOldestAndNewestItems | Export-CSV -NoTypeInformation -Path .\archivefolderstats.csv
  ```

In the command output, look for the item that has the earliest received date in any given folder. Use the following guidance:

- Check the **OldestItemReceivedDate** of all folders that are located under **Top of Information Store**, including **Inbox**, **Sent Items**, **Junk Email**, and any of their user-created subfolders. Exclude **Deleted Items**, **Contacts**, **Calendar** (recurring meetings only), and **Tasks** (recurring tasks only). Then, compare the **OldestItemReceivedDate** value to the **Retention Age** value that's specified in the non-working policy.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - For more information about deleted items, recurring calendar items, and tasks, see [Determining the age of different types of items](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/retention-age#determining-the-age-of-different-types-of-items).
  > - Contacts aren't processed by retention policies because they don't have a start or expiration date stamp.

- For items that are in the *Recoverable Items* folder, check the **OldestItemLastModifiedDate** instead, and compare it to the **RetainDeletedItemsFor** property that's set on the affected mailbox.

In the output, also check which policies are applied to the folders, and determine whether any disabled personal tags, active personal tags, or even retention compliance policies override the expected policy. Review the following columns:

- **DeletePolicy**
- **ArchivePolicy**
- **CompliancePolicy**
- **RetentionFlags**

These columns indicate whether a default folder retention tag, a personal retention tag, or a personal archive tag is applied to the folders. The **RetentionFlags** column can also show:

- Whether an explicit retention tag or archive tag is applied (explicit tags indicate that the policies are manually applied and not inherited)
- Whether the folder has to be rescanned by the MFA

> [!NOTE]
> Policies that are applied to folders in the archive mailbox are usually inherited from the folders in the primary mailbox. However, users can apply a different personal tag to a folder within the archive mailbox. For more information, see [Apply a retention tag to a folder in the archive](/exchange/security-and-compliance/messaging-records-management/retention-tags-and-policies#applying-a-retention-tag-to-a-folder-in-the-archive).

### Check the MRM diagnostic logs

To collect the MRM diagnostic log, run the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <mailboxID> -ComponentName MRM
```

Review the log to determine whether any errors occurred when the MFA processed the mailbox. Check the date of the last error to determine its relevance to the current issue.

> [!NOTE]
> If the log contains "resource unhealthy" error messages, this means that the mailbox processing is throttled. Because of the size of the mailbox and the number of items that it contains, MRM is processing the mailbox very slowly. Unfortunately, throttling is unavoidable when you work with large mailboxes. 

If you don't see any logs, and you receive an error message that says "no logs were found", this means that MRM processed the mailbox without any errors.

You should also check the following additional properties that can indicate whether MFA processed the contents of the mailbox:

- ElcLastRunUpdatedItemCount: The number of individual items that were tagged or untagged by MFA on its last run
- ElcLastRunTaggedWithArchiveItemCount: The number of items that MFA updated with an archive tag on its last run
- ElcLastRunTaggedWithExpiryItemCount: The number of items that MFA updated with an expiry (delete) tag on its last run
- ElcLastRunDeletedFromRootItemCount: The number of items from the *Deleted Items* folder that expired and were automatically moved to the *Recoverable Items* folder
- ElcLastRunDeletedFromDumpsterItemCount: The number of items that MFA deleted from the *Recoverable Items* folder on its last run
- ElcLastRunArchivedFromRootItemCount: The number of items that were moved from **Inbox** or **Top of Information Store** of the primary mailbox to **Inbox** or **Top of Information Store** of the archive mailbox
- ElcLastRunArchivedFromDumpsterItemCount: The number of items that were moved from the *Recoverable Items* folder of the primary mailbox to the *Recoverable Items* folder of the archive mailbox
- ElcLastSuccessTimestamp: The last time that MFA processed the mailbox without any errors (In the case of MRM throttling, these errors may be temporary. This means that items will continue to be moved or deleted, but at a slower rate than usual.)

To retrieve these properties, run the following PowerShell commands. These commands parse the XML and return the Email Life Cycle-related properties that begin with "Elc".

```powershell
$logProps = Export-MailboxDiagnosticLogs <mailboxID> -ExtendedProperties
$xmlprops = [xml]($logProps.MailboxLog)
$xmlprops.Properties.MailboxTable.Property | ? {$_.Name -like "ELC*"}
```

## Best practices

We recommend that you enable the archive mailbox for an account immediately after it's placed on Litigation Hold. This is especially true if the user has a lot of email traffic. Doing this can help prevent the *Recoverable Items* folder from becoming full and will let users continue to be able to further delete items from their primary mailbox. Additionally, we recommend that you enable [auto-expanding archiving](/microsoft-365/compliance/autoexpanding-archiving?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), depending on the user's [Microsoft 365 license](/office365/servicedescriptions/microsoft-365-service-descriptions/microsoft-365-tenantlevel-services-licensing-guidance/microsoft-365-security-compliance-licensing-guidance#email-archiving).

Notice that the *Recoverable Items* folder of the primary mailbox should not be at the maximum quota because it can also prevent MRM from moving items into the archive. For more information about mailbox folder limits and mailbox storage limits, see [Exchange Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/exchange-online-service-description/exchange-online-limits).
