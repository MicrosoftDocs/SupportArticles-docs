# Scenario: Office Activation

The Office Activation scenario automates checks and recovery activities to reset activation-related settings and successfully activate a subscription version of Office.

In the full version of the Assistant, the equivalent entry point for this scenario is *Office & Office Apps \ I've installed a subscription version of Office, but I can't activate it*.

**Note:** This scenario requires that you use an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Select the following button:

> [Download the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles)

For complete details about how to run the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](sara-command-line-version.md).

## Available switches for the Office Activation scenario

The following switches are available for this scenario. They aren't case-sensitive. Unless noted as optional, the switches are required to run the scenario. You can use more than one optional switch.

|Switch \<parameter\>|Details|Required/Optional|
|---|---|---|
|`-S <scenarioname>`|Specify this switch and `OfficeActivationScenario` as the value for the `scenarioname` parameter to run this scenario.|Required|
|`-AcceptEula`|Specify this switch to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) and run this scenario.|Required|
|`-CloseOffice`|Specify this switch to close all Office apps that are running.|Required|
|`-RemoveSCA`|Specify this switch to remove Shared Computer Activation (SCA) and to configure non-SCA activation for Office.|Optional|

## Sample commands

Here are some sample combinations of switches to run the Office Activation scenario.

- Sample 1

  To make sure that the requirements for Office activation are met, and to prepare for successful activation at the next startup of an Office app, run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window:

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeActivationScenario -AcceptEula -CloseOffice
  ```

- Sample 2

  To do the same steps as in sample 1, and also remove SCA if it's enabled, run the following command in an elevated Command Prompt window:

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeActivationScenario -AcceptEula -CloseOffice -RemoveSCA
  ```

## Detected conditions and results

When you run the Office Activation scenario by using the Enterprise version of the Assistant, you don't receive any prompts. This is a different experience from the full version of the Assistant. The following table describes the actions that the Enterprise version of the Assistant takes for each condition that's encountered in this scenario, and the corresponding output that is displayed.
