# Scenario: Office Shared Computer Activation

The Office Shared Computer Activation scenario automates checks and recovery activities to enable or disable shared computer activation on a device. Shared computer activation for Office is supported for specific subscription plans. For more information, see [Overview of shared computer activation for Microsoft 365 Apps](/deployoffice/overview-shared-computer-activation).

In the full version of the Assistant, the equivalent entry point for this scenario is *Office & Office Apps \ I want to setup Office with shared computer activation on a computer or server in my organization*.

**Note:** This scenario requires that you use an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant
