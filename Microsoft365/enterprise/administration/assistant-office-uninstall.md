# Scenario: Office Uninstall

The Office Uninstall scenario removes any version of Office from a device. This scenario automates all the steps that are described and provided in [Uninstall Office from a PC](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8).

In the full version of the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant, the equivalent entry point for this scenario is *Office & Office Apps \ I have Office installed, but I'm having trouble uninstalling it*.

**Note:** This scenario requires that you use an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Select the following button:

For complete details about how to run the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](sara-command-line-version.md).
