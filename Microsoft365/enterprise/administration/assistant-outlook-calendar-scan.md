# Scenario: Outlook Calendar Scan

The Outlook Calendar Scan scenario scans a Microsoft Outlook calendar to identify and report issues that involve general settings such as permissions, free/busy publishing, delegate configuration, and Direct Booking settings. For more information, see [Scan Outlook calendar by using Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](/outlook/troubleshoot/calendaring/scan-outlook-calendar-using-sara).

In the full version of the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant, the equivalent entry point for this scenario is *Advanced diagnostics \ Outlook \ Create a detailed scan of my Outlook Calendar to identify and resolve issues*.

**Note:** This scenario doesn't require that you use an elevated Command Prompt window.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Select the following button:

For complete details about how to run the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](sara-command-line-version.md).

## Available switches for the Outlook Calendar Scan scenario

The following switches are available for this scenario. They aren't case-sensitive. Unless noted as optional, the switches are required to run the scenario. You can use more than one optional switch.

|Switch \<parameter\>|Details|Required/Optional|

|`-S <scenarioname>`|Specify this switch and `OutlookCalendarCheckTask` as the value for the `scenarioname` parameter to run this scenario.|Required|
|`-AcceptEula`|Specify this switch to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) and to run this scenario.|Required|
|`-P <Profile Name>`|Specify this switch and use the `<Profile Name>` parameter to identify the Outlook profile that the scenario has to scan.|Optional|
|`-LogFolder <Output Path>`|Specify this switch to force *SaraCmd.exe* to output scenario-specific logs to the folder that's specified by the `<Output Path>` parameter.|Optional|
|`-HideProgress`|Specify this switch to hide the progress display for this scenario. By default, the Assistant always displays the progress of tasks in the console.|Optional|

## Sample commands

Here are some sample combinations of switches to run this scenario.

- Sample 1

  To scan a calendar for the active profile in the instance of Outlook that's running, run the following command in a non-elevated Command Prompt window.
  
  **Note:** If Outlook isn't running, the calendar for the default Outlook profile will be scanned.

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OutlookCalendarCheckTask -AcceptEula
  ```

- Sample 2

  To scan a calendar for the profile named *MyProfile* in the instance of Outlook that's running, run the following command in a non-elevated Command Prompt window.

  **Note:**

  - If Outlook is running, and the active profile isn't named *MyProfile*, the scenario will return an error result.
  - If Outlook isn't running, the profile that's named *MyProfile* must exist.

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OutlookCalendarCheckTask -AcceptEula -P MyProfile
  ```

- Sample 3

  To scan a calendar for the active profile in the instance of Outlook that's running, and output log files to the *C:\temp* folder, run the following command in a non-elevated Command Prompt window.

  **Note:** The folder that's specified with the `-LogFolder` switch must exist and be writeable.

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OutlookCalendarCheckTask -AcceptEula -LogFolder C:\temp
  ```

- Sample 4

  To scan a calendar for the profile that's named *MyProfile* in the instance of Outlook that's running, and hide the progress display in the console, run the following command in a non-elevated Command Prompt window:

  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OutlookCalendarCheckTask -AcceptEula -P MyProfile -HideProgress
  ```
