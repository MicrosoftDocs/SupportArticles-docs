# Scenario: Outlook Scan

The Outlook Scan scenario scans your device and creates a detailed report about Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Office, Windows, and mailbox configurations.

In the full version of the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant, the equivalent entry point for the scenario is *Advanced diagnostics \ Outlook \ Create a detailed report of my Outlook, Office, Windows, and mailbox configuration*.

**Note:** This scenario doesn't require that you use an elevated Command Prompt window.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Select the following button:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Download the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles)

For complete details about how to run the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](sara-command-line-version.md).

## Script the Outlook Scan scenario

You can automate some of the tasks to run the scenario. The following sample Windows PowerShell script can help you get started. You can also edit it to better fit your requirements.

**Note**: Detailed instructions for the script are provided in the included comments. 

[Download the Outlook Scan scenario script](https://aka.ms/SaRAEnterpriseOutlookAdvancedDiagnostic)

The script performs the following basic tasks.

1. Copy the files for the Enterprise version of the Assistant to the client from the location specified in the script.

   The default download location that's referenced in the script is [https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles). This is the internet download location for the Assistant. However, you can modify the script to use either a path to the .zip file for the Assistant download or a folder location that contains the files that are extracted from the Assistant download.

2. Start SaraCmd.exe to run the Outlook Scan scenario by using the required switches and parameters.

3. Gather the log files generated when the scenario runs.

   The script collects all the log files that are generated by the Assistant.

4. Create a consolidated .zip file that includes all the logs.

   All the log files that are generated by the Assistant are compressed into a .zip file. The name of this .zip file is customizable.
   
## Available switches for the Outlook Scan scenario

The following switches are available for this scenario. They aren't case-sensitive. Unless noted as optional, the switches are required to run the scenario. You can use more than one optional switch.
