# Scenario: Reset Office Activation

The Reset Office Activation scenario automates all the checks that are described and the scripts that are provided in [Reset activation state for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state).

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario isn't available in the full version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant.

This scenario requires that you use an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

## Download the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Select the following button:

> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> [Download the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles)

For complete details about how to run the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](sara-command-line-version.md).

## Script the Reset Office Activation scenario

You can automate some of the tasks to run the scenario. The following sample Windows PowerShell script can help you get started. You can also edit it to better fit your requirements.

**Note**: 

- The script requires an elevated Windows PowerShell session (use the 'Run as administrator' option).
- Detailed instructions for the script are provided in the included comments.

[Download the Reset Office Activation scenario script](https://aka.ms/SaRAEnterpriseResetOfficeActivation)

The script performs the following basic tasks. 

1. Copy the files for the Enterprise version of the Assistant to the client from the location specified in the script.

   The default download location that's referenced in the script is [https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles). This is the internet download location for the Assistant. However, you can modify the script to use either a path to the .zip file for the Assistant download or a folder location that contains the files that are extracted from the Assistant download.

2. Start SaraCmd.exe to run the Reset Office Activation scenario by using the required switches and parameters.

3. Gather the log files generated when the scenario runs.

   The script collects all the log files that are generated by the Assistant.

4. Create a consolidated .zip file that includes all the logs.

   All the log files that are generated by the Assistant are compressed into a .zip file. The name of this .zip file is customizable.
