> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Exit all Office 2016 applications.

3. Locate and then select the following registry key:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\General

4. Locate the **ShownFirstRunOptin** registry value in the key that is specified in step 3. If you do not find **ShownFirstRunOptin**, go to step 5. If you do find it, go to step 7.
5. If you do not find the **ShownFirstRunOptin** registry value, point to **New** on the **Edit** menu, and then click **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
6. Type ShownFirstRunOptin, and then press ENTER.
7. Right-click **ShownFirstRunOptin**, and then click **Modify**.
