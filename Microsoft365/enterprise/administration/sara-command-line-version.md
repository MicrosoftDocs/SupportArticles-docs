# Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

> [!NOTE]  
> This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators only. For help to diagnose and fix issues that affect Microsoft Office, Microsoft 365, or Microsoft Outlook on your computer, see [About the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_Home).

The Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant is a self-contained, enterprise-ready diagnostic tool that you can use to troubleshoot specific client issues that affect Microsoft 365 apps, such as Microsoft Teams and Outlook. This version of the Assistant runs at a command line or through a script such as PowerShell. Administrators will find this version of the Assistant useful if they have to run it on computers in their organization remotely.

To resolve issues on a single computer, we recommend that you use theâ€¯[full version of the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_Home). If multiple devices are affected, use the Enterprise version of the Assistant.

## Supported scenarios

You can use the Enterprise version of the Assistant to resolve issues for the following scenarios. Select a scenario for details about how to run it.

|Scenario|Description|\<Scenarioname\>|
|---|---|---|
|[Outlook Scan](assistant-outlook-scan.md)|Scans Outlook for known issues and generates a comprehensive configuration report for Outlook, Office, and Windows. A full or offline scan can be run.|`ExpertExperienceAdminTask`|
|[Office Uninstall](assistant-office-uninstall.md)|Scrubs any version of Office from a device. Use when you can't fully remove Office through Control Panel.|`OfficeScrubScenario`|
|[Office Activation](assistant-office-activation.md)|Automated checks and recoveries to reset activation-related settings so you can successfully activate a subscription version of Office.|`OfficeActivationScenario`|
|[Office Shared Computer Activation](assistant-office-shared-computer-activation.md)|Automated checks and recoveries to either enable or disable Office Shared Computer Activation.|`OfficeSharedComputerScenario`|
|[Outlook Calendar Scan](assistant-outlook-calendar-scan.md)|Scans your Outlook calendar by using the Calendar Checking tool (CalCheck) for dozens of known problems.|`OutlookCalendarCheckTask`|
|[Teams Meeting Add-in for Outlook](assistant-teams-meeting-add-in-outlook.md)|Automated checks and recoveries to help you get the Teams Meeting Add-in for Outlook running.|`TeamsAddinScenario`|
|[Reset Office Activation](assistant-reset-office-activation.md)|Clear any previous activations of Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to remove related licenses and cached Office account information. This resets Office applications to a clean state. Then, you can activate the applications by using a different Office account or change to a different license mode.|`ResetOfficeActivation`|

## Download and run the Enterprise version of the Assistant

1. Download the Assistant by selecting the following button.
   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Download the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles)
1. In the downloaded *.zip* file, extract the files to a folder that you can access from the user's computer on which you'll run the Assistant.
1. On the user's computer, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, and then press Enter to open a Command Prompt window.

   **Note:** If the scenario that you want to run requires an elevated Command Prompt window, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

1. At the command prompt, navigate to the folder in which you extracted the files from step 2.
1. Run the Assistant by using the appropriate switches for the scenario.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Updates to the Enterprise version of the Assistant are released on a regular basis. To make sure that you're using the latest version that has the most features and highest stability, each build of the application will stop working 90 days after the **Created** date that's listed for the SaRAcmd.exe file. Use the link that's provided in step 1 to always download the latest available version.

## Script the Enterprise version of the Assistant

Because the Enterprise version of the Assistant is a command-line executable, you can script it to simplify the experience and add functionality. The following sample scripts can help you get started. These scripts provide different capabilities.

**Note**: Detailed instructions for each script are provided in the included comments.

Both sample scripts perform the following basic tasks:

1. Copy Assistant Enterprise files to the client from the location that's specified in the script.

   The default download location that's referenced in the script is [https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles). This is the internet download location for the Assistant. However, you can modify the script to use either a path to the .zip file for the Assistant download or a folder location that contains the files that are extracted from the Assistant download.

2. Gather log files that are generated when a scenario is run.

   The script collects all the log files that are generated by the Assistant.

3. Create a consolidated .zip file that includes all the logs.

   All the log files that are generated by the Assistant are compressed into a .zip file. The name of this .zip file is customizable.

### Sample 1: Script to run a non-interactive session

[Download the script for a non-interactive session ](https://aka.ms/SaRAEnterpriseHelper)

This script provides the following additional capability:

 - Start SaraCmd.exe to run the specified scenario by using the switches and parameters that are provided.
  
   You have to update the script to include the switches and parameters that are required to run the desired scenario. The script contains examples for each scenario.

### Sample 2: Script to run an interactive session

[Download the script for an interactive session](https://aka.ms/SaRAEnterpriseInteractiveHelper)

This script provides the following additional capabilities:

 - Prompt for the scenario to be run by the Assistant.
   
   By default, you don't have to modify the script by using any switches or parameters. When the script is run, you're prompted to enter the name of the scenario that you want the script to run.
 - Start SaraCmd.exe to run the specified scenario by using the specified switches and parameters.
   
   After the scenario name is entered at the prompt, the script runs the scenario by using the minimum required switches and parameters. However, you can modify the script to use optional switches and parameters based on your requirements.
 - Create a draft email message for unsuccessful sessions.
   
   If the Assistant can't successfully complete a scenario, a draft email message is created that includes a .zip file attachment that contains all the session logs.

   **Note**: To use this capability, you have to update the script to include an email address, message subject, and message body.

### Sample 3: Script to run two scenarios back-to-back

[Download the script for back-to-back sessions](https://aka.ms/SaRAEnterpriseMultiScenarioHelper)

This script provides the following additional capabilities:

 - Allow the specification of two scenarios to be run

   **Note**: The script contains the list of supported scenario pairs.

 - Start SaraCmd.exe to run the first scenario.
 - When the first scenario is finished, run a second scenario if the result code from the first scenario indicates a successful completion.
