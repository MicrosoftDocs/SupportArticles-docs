# Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

> [!NOTE]
> This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators only. For help to diagnose and fix issues with Office, Microsoft 365 or Outlook on your computer, see [About the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_Home).

The Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant is a self-contained enterprise-ready diagnostic tool that you can use to troubleshoot specific client issues with Office, Teams, Outlook or through Advanced Diagnostics. This version of the Assistant runs at a command-line or through a script such as PowerShell. It's useful when administrators need to run the Assistant on computers in their organization remotely.

To fix issues on a single computer, we recommend that you use theâ€¯[full version of the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_Home). If multiple devices are impacted by an issue, the Enterprise version of the Assistant is recommended.

## Supported scenarios

You can use the Enterprise version of the Assistant to resolve issues for the following scenarios. The Assistant requires specific switches to run these scenarios. Select a scenario to learn about the switches that are available for it. Then run the Enterprise version of the Assistant by using the appropriate switches for the scenario to resolve your issue.

|Scenario|Description|Command-line scenario name (specified with the `-S` switch)|
|---|---|---|
|[Outlook Scan](assistant-outlook-scan.md)|Scans Outlook for known issues and generates a comprehensive configuration report for Outlook, Office, and Windows. A full or offline scan can be run.|`ExpertExperienceAdminTask`|
|[Office Uninstall](assistant-office-uninstall.md)|Scrubs any version of Office from a device. Use when you can't fully remove Office through Control Panel.|`OfficeScrubScenario`|
|[Office Activation](assistant-office-activation.md)|Automated checks and recoveries to reset activation-related settings so you can successfully activate a subscription version of Office.|`OfficeActivationScenario`|

|[Reset Office Activation](assistant-reset-office-activation.md)|Clear prior activations of Microsoft 365 Apps for Enterprise to remove related licenses and cached Office account information. This resets Office applications to a clean state and you can then activate them with a different Office account or change to a different license mode.|`ResetOfficeActivation`|
