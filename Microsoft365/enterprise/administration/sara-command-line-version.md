# Command-line version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

The command-line version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant is a self-contained enterprise-ready diagnostic tool that you can use to troubleshoot specific client issues with Office, Teams, and Outlook. This verson of the Assistant runs either at a command line or through a script such as PowerShell. It is useful when administrators need to run the Assistant on computers in their organization remotely.

## Download and run the command-line version of the Assistant

1. Download SaRA from [https://aka.ms/SaRA_CommandLineVersionFiles](https://aka.ms/SaRA_CommandLineVersionFiles) .
1. In the downloaded .zip file, extract the files to a folder that you can access from the computer on which you'll run SaRA.
1. On the user's computer, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, and then press Enter to open a Command Prompt window.

    **Note:** See the table in the "[Supported switches](#supported-switches)" section to determine whether an elevated Command Prompt window is required to run SaRA for the user's scenario.

1. In the Command Prompt window, navigate to the folder in which you extracted the files from step 2.
1. Run the command-line version of SaRA by using one or more switches that are discussed in the "[Supported switches](#supported-switches)" section.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Updates to the command-line version of SaRA will be released on a regular basis. To make sure that you're using the latest version that has the most features and highest stability, each build of the application will stop working 90 days after the listed **Created** date for SaRAcmd.exe. Use the link provided in step 1 to download the latest version.

## Supported switches

The following switches are available to control SaRAcmd.exe.

**Note:** The switches aren't case-sensitive.

1. `-S <scenarioname>`

   Use the `-S` switch to specify the scenario that you want to run. The switch can't be run on its own. It must be followed by `-AcceptEula`. For example, to run the scenario that removes the currently installed version of Office, enter `-S OfficeScrubScenario -AcceptEula`, and then press Enter.

   Currently, the following values for `Scenarioname` are supported with the `-S` switch.

   |`Scenarioname` value|Equivalent scenario entry point in the full (UI) version of SaRA (for reference)|Elevated Command Prompt window required|
   |---|---|:-:|
   |`ExpertExperienceAdminTask`|Advanced Diagnostics \ Outlook| No |
   |`OfficeScrubScenario`|Office \ I have Office installed, but I'm having trouble uninstalling it| Yes |
   |`TeamsAddinScenario`|Teams \ The Teams Meeting option isn't shown, or the Teams Meeting add-in doesn't load in Outlook| No |
   |`OfficeActivationScenario`|Office \ I've installed a subscription version of Office, but I can't activate it|      Yes |
   |`OutlookCalendarCheckTask`|Advanced Diagnostics \ Outlook \ Create a detailed scan of my Outlook Calendar to identify and resolve issues| No |
   |`OfficeSharedComputerScenario`|Office \ I want to setup Office with shared computer activation on a computer or server in my organization| Yes |
   |`ResetOfficeActivation`|NA: Command-line only scenario for resetting the Office Activation state.| Yes |
   
   **Note:** To open an elevated Command Prompt window, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the results, and then select **Run as administrator**.

2. `-AcceptEula`

   The End User License Agreement (EULA) must be accepted before any scenario can be run. If you're using `-AcceptEULA`, you must also use `-S <scenarioname>` to specify    the scenario that you want to run. For example, to uninstall Office, run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt window:

   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeScrubScenario -AcceptEula
   ```

   If you want to run the Advanced Diagnostic scenario for Outlook, run the following command:

   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -S ExpertExperienceAdminTask -AcceptEula
   
3. `-DisplayEULA`

   Use the `-DisplayEULA` switch to display the EULA. To save the EULA text to a file, run a command that resembles the following example:

   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -DisplayEULA > c:\temp\SaRAEula.txt
   ```

   **Note**: The above example outputs the EULA as a text file called SaRAEula.txt in the C:\temp folder.
   
4. `-CloseOutlook`

   The `-CloseOutlook` switch is required to run the **TeamsAddinScenario**.
   
   **Note**: If Outlook is running, this switch closes Outlook.
   
   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -S TeamsAddinScenario -AcceptEula -CloseOutlook
   ```

5. `-CloseOffice`

   The `-CloseOffice` switch is required to run the **OfficeActivationScenario**, **OfficeSharedComputerScenario**, and **ResetOfficeActivation** scenarios.
 
   **Note**: The `-CloseOffice` switch closes Office applications.
   
   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeActivationScenario -AcceptEula -CloseOffice
   ```
   
6. `-LogFolder <Output Path>`

   The `-LogFolder` switch is optional for the **ExpertExperienceAdminTask** and **OutlookCalendarCheckTask** scenarios. If the `-LogFolder` switch is used, it forces SaraCmd.exe to output scenario-specific logs to the folder that's specified by `Output Path`.
  
7. `-P <Profile Name>`
  
   The `-P` switch is optional for the **OutlookCalendarCheckTask** scenario. `Profile name` is the Outlook profile that's scanned by the OutlookCalendarCheckTask scenario.
  
8. `-RemoveSCA`
  
   The `-RemoveSCA` switch is optional for **OfficeActivationScenario** and **OfficeSharedComputerScenario**. This switch removes Shared Computer Activation (SCA) and configures non-SCA activation for Office.
  
9. `-HideProgress`
  
   The `-HideProgress` switch is optional and only works with the **ExpertExperienceAdminTask** and **OutlookCalendarCheckTask** scenarios. The default feature is to always show progress. When this switch is used, it hides the progress display for the ExpertExperienceAdminTask and OutlookCalendarCheckTask scenarios.
  
10. `-OfflineScan`
  
    The `-OfflineScan` switch is optional and only works with the **ExpertExperienceAdminTask** scenario. This switch forces the scan of Outlook to be an Offline scan when the Outlook application is running. 
  
11. `-OfficeVersion <version>`
  
    The `-OfficeVersion` switch is optional and works only with the **OfficeScrubScenario** scenario. Using this switch only removes the Office version that's defined in the `<version>` parameter. Allowable values for `<version>` are: All, M365, 2021, 2019, 2016, 2013, 2010, or 2007. For example, to uninstall only Office 2016, run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt window:
   
   ```console
   SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeScrubScenario -AcceptEula -Officeversion 2016
   ```
 To uninstall all Office versions,  run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt window:
 
  ```console
  SaRAcmd.exe -S OfficeScrubScenario -AcceptEula -Officeversion All
  ```
   
12. `-Help`

    The `-Help` switch displays a link to online content for additional information. If you use `-Help` together with other switches, `-Help` will override all the other  switches except the `-?` switch.

13. `-?`

    Use the `-?` switch to display the functions of all the switches that are available for SaRAcmd.exe. If you use `-?` together with other switches, `-?` will override the other switches.

## Conditions addressed by the command-line scenarios
