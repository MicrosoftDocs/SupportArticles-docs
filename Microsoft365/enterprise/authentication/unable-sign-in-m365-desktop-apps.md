# Unable to sign in to Microsoft 365 desktop applications

## Symptoms

You might experience any of the following behaviors with Microsoft 365 desktop applications on your device:

- An open application’s window closes abruptly.
- An application doesn’t open when you launch it. No error message is displayed but entries are logged in the event log.
- Unable to sign in to a desktop application. You see either the **Need Password** prompt or the **There is a problem with your account** message when you try to sign in.
- Unable to connect to the desktop application even after you log in by using a credential prompt, exit and launch the application again, or restart the device.

This issue also affects other Azure AD-integrated applications that get their tokens from WAM.

However, Microsoft 365 applications on the web and their mobile versions aren't affected by this issue.

## Cause

The Microsoft Azure AD WAM plugin is removed as a side effect of a remote scan performed by a vulnerability assessment software provided by Tenable, a third party provider. The plugin facilitates the authentication of desktop applications. For more information, see [this post](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/Plugin-Updates-to-Address-Windows-Scan-Targets-being-left-unable-to-connect-to-Azure-Active-Directory-AAD).

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, use one of the following options.

### Option 1: Fix a single affected device

To fix the issue on a single device, run the following [Add-AppxPackage](/powershell/module/appx/add-appxpackage?view=windowsserver2022-ps&preserve-view=true) cmdlet:

```powershell
Add-AppxPackage -Register "$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown
```

### Option 2: Fix multiple devices simultaneously by using Microsoft Endpoint Manager

You can use either the Configuration Manager or Intune component in Microsoft Endpoint Manager to automate a fix for multiple devices. Use the component that works best for you.

#### Use Configuration Manager

1. In the Configuration Manager console, navigate to the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then select **Configuration Items**.

   ```powershell
   $broker = Get-AppxPackage -Name "Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin"
   if ($broker -match "Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin") { exit 0 } else { exit 1 }
   ```

1. Save the following remediation script as a .ps1 UTF-8 file:

   ```powershell
    Add-AppxPackage -Register "$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown
   ```
