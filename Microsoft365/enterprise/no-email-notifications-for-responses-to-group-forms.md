You may not receive email notifications for responses that you submit to a Group Form, such as a Form that you create in Microsoft Teams. To receive email notifications, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Forms at [https://forms.office.com](https://forms.office.com), and then click **Group forms**.

   ![Selecting Recent group forms field](./media/no-email-notifications-for-responses-to-group-forms/recent-group-forms.png)

1. Select your group. In this example, the test group is selected.

1. On the right side, you see the number of members in the group. Click that number, and then it opens the group email page in Outlook.
