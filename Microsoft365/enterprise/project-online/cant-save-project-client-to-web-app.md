# You can't save a project from a Project client to Project Web App

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to save a project from a Project client to Project Web App (PWA), you receive the following error message:

**The following job failed to complete.**
**Job Type: Save**
**Error ID: 12005(0xEE5)**
**Error: Queue failed to process the message.**

## Cause

This issue occurs because of outdated credentials for the user account that you use to connect to PWA from a Project client.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
1. Open **Control Panel**.
2. Click **User Accounts** -> **Credentials Manager** -> **Windows Credentials** in the **Manage your credentials** window, and then remove any credentials that are stored in the **Credential Manager** window.

3. Open the Project client and then connect to PWA.
4. Save the project again to check the behavior.
