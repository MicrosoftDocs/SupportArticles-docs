[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms 

When you try to use the connect-MSOLService cmdlet in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell to connect to a Microsoft cloud service such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune, your attempt is unsuccessful. Additionally, you may receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
Connect-MsolService : Access Denied. You do not have permissions to call this cmdlet.
```
