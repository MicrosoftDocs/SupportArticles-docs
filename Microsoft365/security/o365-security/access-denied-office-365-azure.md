# "Access Denied" error when you use the connect-MSOLService cmdlet to connect to Microsoft 365

## Symptoms 

When you try to use the connect-MSOLService cmdlet in the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell to connect to a Microsoft cloud service such as Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, or Microsoft Intune, your attempt is unsuccessful. Additionally, you may receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
Connect-MsolService : Access Denied. You do not have permissions to call this cmdlet.
```

## Resolution 

This issue can be resolved by adding the member/user to an administrator role within Azure. For more information, see the article [Add-MsolRoleMember](/powershell/module/msonline/add-msolrolemember?preserve-view=true&view=azureadps-1.0).
