# Error when accessing applications from iOS devices

## Symptoms

When you try to start a web application from an iOS device, you receive the following error message:

> You can't get there from here

## Cause

This error occurs if your organization has configured a Conditional Access policy that prevents access to the application from iOS devices.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, determine which Conditional Access policy causes the error, and then modify the corresponding policy.

**Note:** You must have administrator permissions to modify the Conditional Access policy.

Here's how to identify the problematic Conditional Access policy:

1. In the error message, select **More details** to open the Azure Active Directory **Sign-in logs**.
1. To see the **Request ID** of the failed request, select **User sign-ins (interactive)**.
