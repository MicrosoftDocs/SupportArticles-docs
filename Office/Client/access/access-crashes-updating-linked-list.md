## Symptoms

When you update a linked SharePoint list in Microsoft Access, and then you try to commit the record change, Access crashes.

## Cause

This problem occurs because of an infinite loop condition that occurs when Access tries to validate a lookup column's bound value, and the physical order of the bound value is not also in logical order. This problem occurs if the **Use the cache format that is compatible with Microsoft Access 2010 and later** check box is not selected.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, select theÂ **Use the cache format that is compatible with Microsoft Access 2010 and later** check box. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Access, select **File** > **Options**.
2. Select **Current Database**.
3. Scroll down to the **Caching Web Service** area, and then locate the Microsoft SharePoint tables.
4. Make sure the **Use the cache format that is compatible with Microsoft Access 2010 and later** check box is selected.
