# Memory leak when Access continually connects to database files

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptom

When Microsoft Access (MsAccess.exe) or a custom solution continually connects toÂ Access database files (.mdb or .accdb) through the Access ODBC driver and the OLE DB provider (Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0), the memory usage of the Access database engine keeps increasing until the process is completed.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Access database engine continuously allocates memory to run insert, update, and delete records in the Access database files. The Access database engine isn't intended for use with high-stress, high-concurrency, 24-hour-a-day, or seven-day-a-week server applications.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, regularly restart the applications or the computer.
