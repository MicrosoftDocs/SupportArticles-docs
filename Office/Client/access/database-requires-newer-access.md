# "Database you are trying to open requires a newer version of Microsoft Access" error in Access

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to open a Microsoft Access database, you receive the following error message:

"The database you are trying to open requires a newer version of Microsoft Access" when opening an Access database."

## Cause

This issue occurs if you try to open a database that contains a table that uses the BigInt data type. BigInt support was added to Access 2016. BigInt appears within the table's data type as **Large Number**.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, determine whether the use of BigInt is required. If so, update users to Access 2016 version 16.0.**7xxx.xxxx** or later. Alternatively, change the data type from **Large Number** to just **Number**.

> [!NOTE]
> Create a backup of your database before you change the data type. If there is **Large Number** data in a column when you change the data type to **Number**, you receive a "Microsoft Access encountered errors while converting the data" dialog box. If you click **Yes** to proceed, the records that contain large numbers are deleted.

## More Information

The use of a **Large Number** data type sets the file format to version 16.7. You can determine a database's file format version by pressing Ctrl-G to open the Immediate window. Type ?Application.CurrentDB.Version in the window, and then press Enter.
