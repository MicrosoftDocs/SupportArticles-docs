# ACCESS 2010: Extra report page prints when Group Footer set to After Section

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptom 

When printing a Microsoft Access 2010 report that has a Group Footer, you may see an extra page print at the end of the report. 

## Cause 

The issue occurs when the Force New Page property of a Group Footer on a report is set to "After Section". 

Microsoft is aware of this problem in Microsoft Access 2010. 

## Resolution 

To work around this problem, you can accomplish the same results by forcing a new page before the group header instead of after the group footer.

In the report's Group Header set the Force New Page property to "Before Section"
In the report's Group Footer set the Force New Page property to "None"

To do so:

1. In report Design View, select the horizontal bar for the Group Header   
2. Click the Property Sheet icon in the Ribbon   
3. On the Format tab click in the section to the right of Force New Page, click the dropdown arrow and select "Before Section"   
4. Select the horizontal bar for the Group Footer   
5. On the Property Sheet's Format tab click in the section to the right of Force New Page, click the dropdown arrow and select "None"
