# "File sharing lock count exceededâ€¦" error during large transaction processing

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When one or more users process many transactions in a multi-user environment, the transactions may fail with the following error message:

**File sharing lock count exceeded. Increase MaxLocksPerFile registry entry.**

## Cause

The error occurs if the number of locks required to perform a transaction exceeds the maximum number of locks per file.

## Workaround

Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: 

[322756 ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

To work around this problem, increase the maximum number of locks per file. To do this, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Set the registry key to MaxLocksPerFile to increase the maximum number of locks per file

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.   
2. Type regedit, and then click **OK**.   
3. Use the appropriate method:
   - In Microsoft Access 2000, in Microsoft Access 2002, and in Microsoft Office Access 2003 that are running on a 32-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0\Engines\Jet 4.0**

     In Microsoft Access 2000, in Microsoft Access 2002, and in Microsoft Office Access 2003 that are running on a 64-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Jet\4.0\Engines\Jet 4.0**
   - In Microsoft Office Access 2007 that is running on a 32-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

     In Microsoft Office Access 2007 that is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

   - In Microsoft Access 2010 that is running on a 32-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:

     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

     In Microsoft Office Access 2010 that is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
  
     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

   - In Microsoft Access 2013 that is running on a 32-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
    
     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

     In Microsoft Office Access 2013 that is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
  
     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

   - In Microsoft Access 2016 that is running on a 32-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
    
     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

     In Microsoft Office Access 2016 that is running on a 64-bit Windows operating system, use Registry Editor to locate the following registry key:
  
     **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Access Connectivity Engine\Engines\ACE**

4. In the right pane of Registry Editor, double click **MaxLocksPerFile**.   
5. On the **Edit DWORD Value** dialog box, click **Decimal**.   
6. Modify the value of the **Value data** box as required, and then click **OK**.

**Note** that this method changes the registry setting for all applications that use Microsoft Jet database engine version 4.0.

### Method 2: Use the SetOption method to temporarily change MaxLocksPerFile

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code in this article uses Microsoft Data Access Objects. For this code to run correctly, you must reference the Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library. To do so, click **References** on the **Tools** menu in the Visual Basic Editor, and make sure that the **Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library** check box is selected.

The SetOption method temporarily overrides the default number of locks per file. You set the default number of locks per file when you set the MaxLocksPerFile registry key. You set the new value by using the SetOption method. The new value is valid until you close the DBEngine object. To use Method 2, follow these steps: 

1. Open Microsoft Access.    
2. Open a database, and then press Alt+F11 to launch the Visual Basic editor.  
3. On the **Microsoft Visual Basic -\<Database Name>-[\<Module Name> (Code)]** window, click **Immediate Window** in the **View** menu.    
4. In **Immediate Window**, enter the following code. 

  **DAO.DBEngine.SetOption dbmaxlocksperfile,15000**
5. Press the ENTER key to run the line of code.

   **Note** This temporarily sets the MaxLocksPerFile value to 15,000.   

To process large transactions, set the MaxLocksPerFile value to meet your requirement, and then run the transactions in the session. 

Changes you make to the MaxLocksPerFile setting by using the SetOption method are available only for the current session. 

## More information

The MaxLocksPerFile setting determines the maximum number of locks Microsoft Jet places against a file. The default MaxLocksPerFile value is 9,500. However, do not change this value if you are working on a Novell NetWare server, because the maximum server record locks per connection is 10,000.
