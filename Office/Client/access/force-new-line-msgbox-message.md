# How to force a new line in a MsgBox message in Access

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills. 

This article applies to either a Microsoft Access database (.mdb) file or to a Microsoft Access database (.accdb) file, and to a Microsoft Access project (.adp) file.

## Summary

If you want to force a new line in a message box, you can include one of the following:

- The Visual Basic for Applications constant for a carriage return and line feed, vbCrLf.   
- The character codes for a carriage return and line feed, Chr(13) & Chr(10).  

For example, if you had the following message:

**NOTICE: This is an Important Message!**

and you wanted the message to be displayed as  

```adoc
NOTICE:
 
This is an Important Message!
```
you would enter the message as a string expression as in either of the following examples: 

- Example Using the Visual Basic for Applications Constant: 

    ```vb
    MsgBox "NOTICE:" & vbCrLf & "This is an Important Message!"
    ```
- Example Using the Character Codes: 
    ```vb
    MsgBox "NOTICE:" & Chr(13) & Chr(10) & "This is an Important Message!"
    ```

 You can also use the vbCrLfconstant to create multiple lines in a text box on a form or on a data access page.
