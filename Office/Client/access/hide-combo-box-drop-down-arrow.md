This article demonstrates a method that you can use to hide the drop-down arrow on a combo box until the combo box is selected.

## Steps to hide the drop-down arrow on a combo box

To hide the drop-down arrow on a combo box when the combo box is not selected, follow these steps:

1. Start Access.
2. On the **Help** menu, point to **Sample Databases**, and then click **Northwind Sample Access Database**.
3. Open the Orders form in **Design** view.
4. Add a rectangle control to the form. Size and move the rectangle control so that it completely covers the drop-down arrow on the EmployeeID combo box.
5. Set the `BackColor` property of the rectangle to match the `BackColor` property of the section.
6. Set the `BackStyle` property to **Normal**.
7. Set the `BorderStyle` to **Transparent**.
8. View the form in **Form** view.

Notice that you can see the drop-down arrow on the EmployeeID combo box only when the combo box is selected.
