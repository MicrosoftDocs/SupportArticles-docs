# How to loop through the references to view their properties in Microsoft Access

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 209849

## Summary

When you view the location of references with the References dialog box on the Tools menu, the trailing portion of the path name may be truncated because of the limitations of the dialog box. This article shows you how to use a Visual Basic for Applications procedure to loop through the References collection and retrieve the properties of each reference.

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied.

This article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language that is being demonstrated and with the tools that are used to create and to debug procedures. Microsoft support engineers can help explain the functionality of a particular procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific requirements.

## More information

To loop through the References collection and retrieve the properties of each reference, follow these steps:

1. Create a module and type the following line in the **Declarations** section if it is not already there:

    ```vb
    Option Explicit
    ```

1. Type the following procedure:

    ```vb
    Function ReferenceInfo()

        Dim strMessage  As String
        Dim strTitle    As String
        Dim refItem     As Reference

        On Error Resume Next

        For Each refItem In References
            If refItem.IsBroken Then
                strMessage = "Missing Reference:" & vbCrLf & refItem.FullPath
            Else
                strMessage = "Reference: " & refItem.Name & vbCrLf _
                           & "Location: " & refItem.FullPath & vbCrLf
            End If
            Debug.Print strMessage
        Next refItem

    End Function
    ```

1. To test this function, type the following line in the Immediate window, and then press ENTER:

    ```vb
    ? ReferenceInfo
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Each reference is listed in the Immediate window.
