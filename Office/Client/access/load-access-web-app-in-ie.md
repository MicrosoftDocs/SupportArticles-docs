[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to load a Microsoft Access web app in Internet Explorer, the app may not load completely, and then you receive an "Error has occurred. Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again later" error message.

> [!NOTE]
> The "TECHNICAL DETAILS" section of the error does not show a value for the Correlation ID.

## Cause

Internet Explorer imposes a time-out limit for the server to return data through the ReceiveTimeout registry key. The value that's specified for this time-out may have been changed to a value that's less than what's needed for the server to respond to the Access app request.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the "More Information" section of the following article to increase the time-out setting to 5 minutes or to another value of your choice:
