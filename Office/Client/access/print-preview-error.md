## Symptoms

You receive a "No current record" error message in Microsoft Access when you try to print or preview a report by using the **Print** command or the **Print Preview** command, and then you move between the report pages.

## Cause

This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

- Your report is grouped on multiple fields.
- In the **Group On** group property list, you selected **Each Value**.
- In the **Group Footer** group property list, you selected **Yes**.
- You have calculations in the group footer.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- Change the **Group On** group property to **Interval** for one of the field groups.
- Change the **Group Footer** group property to **No** for one of the field groups.
- Remove the calculations from the group footer.

> [!NOTE]
> To troubleshoot the precise cause of this problem, try each of these methods one at a time until you no longer receive the error message.
