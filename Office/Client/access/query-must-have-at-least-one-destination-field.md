# "Query must have at least one destination field" when you run an Access query

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you run an existing Microsoft Access query, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Query must have at least one destination field.
```

You do not see the expected query in Design View, and you see only "Select;" or "Select*;" in SQL View.

## Cause

This problem occurs when you run the OutputTo method because of an issue that affects reading the structure of queries that have been designed and saved only within SQL View.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- For each database that is affected by this problem, open the database in Access, click **Options** on the **File** menu, select **Current Database**, and then clear the **Track name AutoCorrect info** check box.
- Make sure that each query is opened and saved while in you are in Design View.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.
