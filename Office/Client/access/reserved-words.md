# List of reserved words in Access 2002 and in later versions of Access

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 286335

> [!NOTE]
> Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers. This article applies to a Microsoft Access database (.mdb) and to a Microsoft Access project (.adp).

## Summary

This article lists words and symbols that you should not use in field, object, and variable names in Microsoft Access 2002 and later versions of Access because they are "reserved words." Reserved words have a specific meaning to Access or to the Microsoft Jet database engine. If you use a reserved word or symbol, you may receive an error such as the following:

> The wizard was unable to preview your report, possibly because a table needed by your report is exclusively locked.

If you use a reserved word, such as date, value, name, text, and year, in Access 2007, you may receive the following message:

> The Name you supplied is a reserved word. Reserved words have a specific meaning to Microsoft Office Access or to the Microsoft Office Access database engine.

For existing objects with names that contain reserved words, you can avoid errors by surrounding the object name with brackets ([ ]).

## More Information

Because it is not practical to provide a list of all reserved words, such as built-in function names or Microsoft Access user-defined names, please check your product documentation for additional reserved words. Note that if you set a reference to a type library, an object library, or an ActiveX control, that library's reserved words are also reserved words in your database. For example, if you add an ActiveX control to a form, a reference is set, and the names of the objects, methods, and properties of that control become reserved words in your database.
