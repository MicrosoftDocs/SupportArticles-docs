Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.

The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding the performance or reliability of these products.

## Technical support from Microsoft Support Professionals

Microsoft Support professionals can help you walk through the steps that are included in the referenced articles. Although Support Professionals can help you troubleshoot your database, Microsoft cannot guarantee that an Access database can be recovered or that data can be recovered during this process. Because a Support Professional will be working with your database, support of this nature is considered Advisory Services level support.

## Contacting Advisory Services

Microsoft Advisory Services is an hourly fee-based, consultative support option that provides proactive support beyond your break-fix product maintenance needs. This is a remote, phone-based support option that includes working with the same technician for assistance with issues like product migration, code review, or new program development. This service is typically used for shorter engagements, and is designed for developers and IT professionals who do not require the traditional onsite consulting or sustained account management services that are available from other Microsoft support options.

For information on Microsoft Advisory Services, refer to this Microsoft Web site: [Support for business](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4341255/support-for-business).
