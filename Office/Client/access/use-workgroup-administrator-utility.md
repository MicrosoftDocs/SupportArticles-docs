  2. On the **Create** tab, in the **Other** group, click **Macro**, and then click **Module**.   
  3. Create a subroutine, and then paste the following Visual Basic code example into the subroutine.

      **DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdWorkgroupAdministrator**

  4. Press F5 to run the code.   

### Method 2: Use the RunCommand macro action

2. On the **Create** tab, in the **Other** group, click **Macro**, and then click **Macro**.   
3. On the **Design** tab, click **Show All Actions** in the **Show/Hide** group.   
4. On the **Macro1** tab, click **RunCommand** in the **Action** column, and then click **WorkgroupAdminstrator** in the **Command** list.   
5. Click **Save**.   
6. In the **Tools** group, click **Run**.
