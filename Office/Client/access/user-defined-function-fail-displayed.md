# Expression Builder doesn't display database's user-defined functions in the Functions node

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 981241

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You open a Microsoft Access database in Disabled mode.
- You open the Expression Builder in a context that enables user-defined functions.
- In the Expression Builder's **Expression Elements** tree view, you expand the **Functions** node.

In this scenario, the database's Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) project is not listed under the **Functions** node.

## Cause

This is by design. This issue occurs because, when the database is opened in Disabled mode, VBA cannot enumerate any of the arguments that are defined for user-defined functions. To enumerate these arguments, VBA must be able to compile the type libraries of the modules that contain the user-defined functions. When the database is in Disabled mode, VBA cannot compile these modules. Therefore, the Expression Builder cannot display the user-defined functions for the database.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, you must open the database in Enabled mode by [letting Access to trust the database](https://support.microsoft.com/office/decide-whether-to-trust-a-database-828ce4e9-1f38-4f4b-89c4-81bb0fcda8a4).
