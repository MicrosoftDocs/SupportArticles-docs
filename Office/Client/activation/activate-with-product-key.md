# Activating Microsoft 365 Apps for Business with a product key

You might have a product key for Microsoft 365 Apps for Business. If so, there are two separate actions you might need to do with the product key. 

## Activate your Microsoft 365 Apps for Business subscription

- If you purchased a Microsoft 365 subscription from a retail store, see [Enter your product key for Microsoft 365 Apps for business](/microsoft-365/commerce/enter-your-product-key).  

- If there's an error message when you try to redeem a product key, see [Problems with your Microsoft 365 for business product key?](/microsoft-365/commerce/product-key-errors-and-solutions)

## Activate Microsoft 365 Apps on your device

Use your Microsoft account, not your product key, to install and activate Microsoft 365 and individually purchased Microsoft 365 Apps, such as Project, Visio, Word, Excel, or Outlook.
