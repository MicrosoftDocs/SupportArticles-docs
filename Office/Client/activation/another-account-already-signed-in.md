# Microsoft 365 Apps activation error: “Sorry, another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer”

When trying to activate Microsoft 365 apps, you might encounter the error:

<summary><b>Check BrokerPlugin process</b></summary>

Some antivirus, proxy, or firewall software might block the following plug-in process:

`Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy`

Temporarily disable your antivirus software. Contact your system administrator to find out if you are behind a proxy or firewall that is blocking this process. If so, you will also need to temporarily disable your proxy or firewall connection. If you connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), you might need to temporarily disable your VPN also.

If the process isn’t blocked, but you still can’t activate Microsoft 365, delete your BrokerPlugin data and then reinstall it using the following steps:

1.	Open File Explorer, and put the following location in the address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1.	Press CTRL + A to select all.
1.	Right-click in the selected files and choose **Delete**.
1.	Put the following location in the File Explorer address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1.	Select all files and delete them.
1.	Restart the device.
1.	Download and run [the SaRA package for sign in issues](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeSignInScenario).
