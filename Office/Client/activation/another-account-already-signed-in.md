# Microsoft 365 apps activation error "Another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer"

When you try to activate Microsoft 365 apps, you receive the following error message even though no other account is in use:

> Sorry, another account from your organization is already signed in on this computer

**Note:** This error is expected if you're already signed in by using another Microsoft 365 account from the same tenant.

If this error occurs when only one account is used, follow the steps that are appropriate for your device:

- For Mac devices, follow these steps:

  1. Close all Microsoft 365 apps.
  1. Open Terminal, and then run the following command:
  
     ```bash
     defaults write com.microsoft.Word ResetOneAuthCreds -bool YES
     ```
     
  1. Open the Microsoft Word app and continue with the activation steps.
  1. If the issue persists, try the steps in [Can't sign in to an Office 2016 for Mac app](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/sign-in/sign-in-to-office-2016-for-mac-fail).
- For Windows devices, follow these steps:

  1. Sign out of all Microsoft 365 apps, and then sign in again.
  1. If the issue still occurs, modify the OneAuth account store on the device:

     1. Navigate to the `%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneAuth\accounts` folder. You'll see one \<GUID\> file, or multiple files that have different GUIDs if there are multiple accounts.
     1. Open the files by using Notepad, examine the **account_hints** value, and identify the files that aren't associated with the account that you want to use to sign in.
     1. In each file that's identified in step b, locate the **association_status** entry, change the association status of `com.microsoft.Office` to **disassociated**, and then save the file.  For example, change  
     *"association_status": "{\\"**com.microsoft.Office**\\":\\"**associated**\\",\\"com.microsoft.Outlook\\":\\"associated\\"}"*  
     to  
     *"association_status": "{\\"**com.microsoft.Office**\\":\\"**disassociated**\\",\\"com.microsoft.Outlook\\":\\"associated\\"}"*.
     1. Try to sign in again.
  1. If the issue persists, sign out of all Microsoft 365 apps, remove all folders in the following locations, and then sign in again:

     - `%localappdata%/Microsoft/OneAuth`
     - `%localappdata%/Microsoft/IdentityCache`
  1. If the issue persists, try the [additional troubleshooting methods](#additional-troubleshooting-methods).

<summary><b>Check BrokerPlugin process</b></summary>

Some antivirus, proxy, or firewall software might block the following plug-in process:

`Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy`

Temporarily disable your antivirus software. Contact your system administrator to find out if you are behind a proxy or firewall that is blocking this process. If so, you will also need to temporarily disable your proxy or firewall connection. If you connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), you might need to temporarily disable your VPN also.

If the process isn't blocked, but you still can't activate Microsoft 365, delete your BrokerPlugin data and then reinstall it using the following steps:

1. Open File Explorer, and put the following location in the address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1. Press CTRL + A to select all.
1. Right-click in the selected files and choose **Delete**.
1. Put the following location in the File Explorer address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1. Select all files and delete them.
1. Restart the device.
1. Download and run [the SaRA package for sign in issues](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeSignInScenario).
