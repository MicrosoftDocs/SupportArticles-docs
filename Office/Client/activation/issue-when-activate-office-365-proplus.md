# "We are unable to connect right now" error when users try to activate Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you set up your network to block Internet Explorer 6, users discover that they cannot activate Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise. When users try to activate Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, they receive the following error message:

**We are unable to connect right now. Please check your network and try again later.**

## Cause

This issue occurs because the client computer cannot connect to *.microsoftonline-p.net.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, add an explicit "allow" rule that contains "MSOIDCRL"in your firewall or proxy for agents. 

For example, set up the rules to first allow MSOIDCRL and to then deny Internet Explorer 6.

For more info about how to configure firewall rules, see your firewall documentation.
