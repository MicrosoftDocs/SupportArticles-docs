# "Sorry, we can't connect to your account." error when you activate Office from Microsoft 365

## Summary

This article discusses how to troubleshoot the activation issues in Microsoft 365. Activation fails and you receive one the following error messages:  

**We are unable to connect right now. Please check your network and try again later.**

**Sorry, we can't connect to your account. Please try again later.**

## More information

This issue might be caused by one of several circumstances. Follow these steps to help troubleshoot the issue. After each step, check to see whether the issue is fixed. If not, proceed to the next step.

### Step 1: Run the Microsoft 365 activation troubleshooter in Get Help

The [Microsoft 365 activation troubleshooter](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeActivation-sarahome) helps you to resolve Microsoft 365 subscription activation issues.

> [!NOTE]
> To run the Microsoft 365 activation troubleshooter, make sure that you're using the same Windows device that Microsoft 365 is installed on. Additionally, make sure that your device is running Windows 10 or a later version.

To run the troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Select the following button to start the troubleshooter.

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Microsoft 365 activation troubleshooter](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeActivation-sarahome)

   If you receive a pop-up window that displays "This site is trying to open Get Help.", select **Open**.
1. Follow the instructions in the Get Help app to run the troubleshooter.

After the troubleshooter finishes, it displays the results and provides additional information about how to resolve the issue.

### Step 2: Check whether you're behind a proxy server  

Are you behind a proxy server? If you're not sure, ask your administrator. If so, you (or your administrator) might have to change the proxy settings for Windows HTTP clients. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator. To do so, select **Start**, type `cmd.exe` in the search box, right-click **cmd.exe** in the list, and then select **Run as administrator**.
2. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
    netsh winhttp set proxy < Address of proxy server >
    ```

### Step 3: Check whether you're behind a firewall  

Are you behind a firewall? If you're not sure, ask your administrator. If you're behind a firewall, it might have to be configured to enable access to the following URLs:

- `https://officecdn.microsoft.com`
- `https://ols.officeapps.live.com/olsc`
- `https://activation.sls.microsoft.com`
- `https://odc.officeapps.live.com`
- `https://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureServer.crl`
- `https://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftRootAuthority.crl`
- `https://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureCommunicationsPCA.crl`
- `https://www.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureCommunicationsPCA.crl`
- `go.microsoft.com`
- `office15client.microsoft.com`

Each firewall will have a different method for enable access to these URIs. Check your software's documentation for instructions or ask your administrator to do this for you.

For more information about Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise URLs and IP addresses, see the following Microsoft article: [Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh373144.aspx)

### Step 4: Check whether you have the appropriate license

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 portal.
2. Select **Settings** :::image type="icon" source="./media/issue-when-activate-office-from-office-365/setting-icon.png"::: and then select **Office 365 settings**.
3. Locate the **Assigned licenses** area.
4. If you see **The latest desktop version of Office**, then you have an Office subscription assigned correctly.
5. If you don't see **The latest desktop version of Office**, contact your administrator or see [What Microsoft 365 business product or license do I have?](https://support.office.com/article/What-Office-365-business-product-or-license-do-I-have-f8ab5e25-bf3f-4a47-b264-174b1ee925fd).

### Step 5: If you previously activated an Office 2013 program on the computer, try to remove the existing product key

To manually remove existing product keys for an Office 2013 program, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt window, type one of the following commands, and then press Enter:  
   - If you're running 64-bit Windows with 32-bit Office:

     ```powershell
     cscript.exe "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\Office15\ospp.vbs" /dstatus
     ```

   - If you're running 32-bit Windows, or running 64-bit Office with 64-bit Windows:  

     ```powershell
     cscript.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\Office15\ospp.vbs" /dstatus 
     ```

2. Examine the output. Look for and locate the last five characters of the installed product key.
3. Remove all product keys. To remove a product key, type the following command and then press Enter:

    ```powershell
    cscript ospp.vbs /unpkey: <Last five characters of product key>
    ```

Here's an example of the output of steps 5a through 5c:
