## Cause

The Office application is running in compatibility mode for a different operating system.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, follow these steps to stop running the application in compatibility mode:

1. Exit the Office application that triggers this error.
2. Locate your Office application, depending on your installation type of Outlook and bitness of Windows and Outlook:

    - MSI-Based installation type:

        \<disk drive>\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office**1x**

        \<disk drive>\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\Office**1x**

    - Click-to-Run installation type:

        \<disk drive>\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office**1x**

        \<disk drive>\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office**1x**

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **1x** placeholder represents your version of Office (16 = Office 2016, 15 = Office 2013)

3. Right-click the Office application that triggers the error, and then click **Properties**.
4. If the **Compatibility** tab is available, click it, and then follow these steps. If the **Compatibility** tab does not exist, go to step 5.

   1. On the **Compatibility** tab, clear the **Run this program in compatibility mode for** option.
   2. Click **Change settings for all users**.
   3. On the **Compatibility for all users** tab, clear the **Run this program in compatibility mode for** option.
   4. Click **OK** two times.

5. If the **Compatibility** tab does not exist, click **Cancel** on the application Properties page to close it, and then follow these steps:

   1. Right-click Outlook.exe, and then select **Troubleshoot compatibility**.
   2. Select **Troubleshoot Program**.
   3. Clear all options, and then click **Next**.
