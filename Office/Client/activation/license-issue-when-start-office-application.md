## Cause

The Office application is running in compatibility mode for a different operating system, or the software protection platform registry key was deleted during an update of Windows from version 1909 to any other version.

## Resolution

### Check the software protection platform registry entry

1. Select **Start**, enter *regedit*, and then select **Registry Editor** from the search results.

1. Navigate to the following subkey:

    `HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-20\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion`

1. If there is a **SoftwareProtectionPlatform** value in the **Current Version** folder, go to the <a href="#stop">Stop running the app in compatibility mode</a>. If there is no such value, go to step 4.

1. On a device that has Office installed and working, open Registry Editor, and navigate to the following subkey:

    `HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-20\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform`

1. Right-click **SoftwareProtectionPlatform**, and select **Export**. Save the registry value as a .reg file to storage media or another location that you can access from the original device.

1. Copy the .reg file to the original device. Then, right-click the file, and select **Merge**.

1. In Registry Editor on the original device, navigate to the following subkey:

    `HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-20\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SoftwareProtectionPlatform`

1. Right-click **SoftwareProtectionPlatform**, and select **Permissions**.

1. Under **Group or user names**, look for an entry for **NETWORK SERVICE**. If you find the entry, go to step 10. If you don't find the entry, select **Add**, enter *network service* in the **Enter the object names to select** field, and then select **OK**.

1. Select **NETWORK SERVICE**, make sure that the **Allow** checkbox next to **Full control** is selected, and then select **Apply** > **OK**.

1. Restart the device, and try again to open an Office app.

<h3 id="stop">Stop running the app in compatibility mode</h3>

1. Exit the Office application that triggers this error.
2. Locate the same Office application. By default, it will be in the following folder, depending on your installation type of Outlook and the bit version of Windows and Outlook:

    - MSI-Based installation type:

        \<disk drive>\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office**1x**

        \<disk drive>\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\Office**1x**

    - Click-to-Run installation type:

        \<disk drive>\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office**1x**

        \<disk drive>\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office**1x**

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **1x** placeholder represents your version of Office (16 = Office 2016, 15 = Office 2013).

3. Right-click the Office application that triggers the error, and then select **Properties**.
4. If the **Compatibility** tab is available, select it, and then follow these steps. If the **Compatibility** tab isn't available, go to step 5.

   1. On the **Compatibility** tab, clear the **Run this program in compatibility mode for** option.
   2. Select **Change settings for all users**.
   3. On the **Compatibility for all users** tab, clear the **Run this program in compatibility mode for** option.
   4. Select **OK** two times.

5. If the **Compatibility** tab isn't available, select **Cancel** on the application **Properties** page to close it, and then follow these steps:

   1. Right-click **Outlook.exe**, and then select **Troubleshoot compatibility**.
   2. Select **Troubleshoot Program**.
   3. Clear all options, and then select **Next**.
   4. Select the **No, I am done investigating the problem** option, and then select **Next**.
   5. Select **Close**.
