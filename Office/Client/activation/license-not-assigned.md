# Microsoft 365 Apps activation error: “You currently have not been assigned an office license that includes the Office desktop apps"

When you try to activate Microsoft 365 apps, you encounter the error message:  

> You currently have not been assigned an office license that includes the Office desktop apps.

Try the following troubleshooting methods to solve the problem.

**Note** Some of these troubleshooting methods can only be performed by a Microsoft 365 admin. If you aren’t an admin, see [How do I find my Microsoft 365 admin?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-do-i-find-my-microsoft-365-admin-59b8e361-dbb6-407f-8ac3-a30889e7b99b)
<br/><br/>

<details>
<summary><b>Check your Microsoft 365 license</b></summary>

1.	Go to the Microsoft 365 portal: https://portal.office.com/account/?ref=MeControl#installs
1.	If you see the message "You currently have not been assigned an Office license that includes the Office desktop apps" this means that you are not eligible to install Microsoft 365 Apps.
1.	If you see "Office" listed with an "Install Office" button, you are eligible for Microsoft 365 Apps.

<details>
<summary><b>Make sure you have the correct Office installed</b></summary>

Go to https://portal.office.com/account to check which Office version and edition you have available.
  
If no Office version is shown, you don’t have an Office license assigned to the account you are signed in with. If you are signed in with your Work or School account, and don’t have a license assigned, contact your Microsoft 365 Administrator to get a license assigned. [How do I find my Microsoft 365 admin?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-do-i-find-my-microsoft-365-admin-59b8e361-dbb6-407f-8ac3-a30889e7b99b) 
  
If you have Microsoft 365 for Business Basic, you won’t have any Office applications to install. You can use Office Online apps at https://office.com.
  
Make sure that the version listed (32-bit or 64-bit) matches your version of Windows. To check what version of Windows you have installed, go to **Start** > **Settings** (gear icon) > **System** > **About**, and check the **System type**.
  
If you have a different edition or version installed on your device, run the SaRA package to uninstall Office. Restart the device, and install from https://portal.office.com/account to get the correct version.
