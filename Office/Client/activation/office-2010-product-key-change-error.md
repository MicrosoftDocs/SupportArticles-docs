## Cause

This may be caused when the product keys of Office 2010 programs do not match.

## How to fix

This issue can be resolved by removing the Office 2010 registry values.

:::image type="icon" source="media/office-2010-product-key-change-error/alert-icon.png"::: The following describes how to modify the registry. Incorrect registry modification can cause serious problems, so please proceed with extra caution. For additional protection, you are recommended to back up the registry before modifying it. This allows you to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about backing up the registry, see [Back up the registry](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

1. Click Start :::image type="icon" source="media/office-2010-product-key-change-error/windows-icon.png"::: and enter regedit in the search pane. At the top of the program list, click regedit.

    :::image type="icon" source="media/office-2010-product-key-change-error/alert-icon.png"::: If the user account control message appears, enter the administrator password, or click Yes.

2. In Registry Editor, go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Registration path.

    > [!TIP]
    > If the operating system is Windows 7 64-bit, go to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Registration path.

3. There are several GUID (Globally Unique Identifiers), consisting of a combination of alphanumeric characters, in the Registration subpath. Each GUID specifies the program that is installed on your computer. Click each GUID to view the registry entries in the right pane, and find and select the GUID that contains the relevant Office program version.
