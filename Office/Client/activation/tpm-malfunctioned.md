# Microsoft 365 Apps activation error: “Trusted Platform Module malfunctioned”

When you try to activate Microsoft 365 apps, you encounter the error:

> Trusted Platform Module malfunctioned

Try the following troubleshooting methods to solve the problem.

**Note** Some of these troubleshooting methods can only be performed by a Microsoft 365 admin. If you aren’t an admin, see [How do I find my Microsoft 365 admin?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-do-i-find-my-microsoft-365-admin-59b8e361-dbb6-407f-8ac3-a30889e7b99b)

<br/>
<details>
<summary><b>Reset Microsoft 365 activation state</b></summary>

Run the [Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA) to reset the Microsoft 365 activation state](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeActivation-Reset).

For manual steps or more information, see [Reset Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise activation state](/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state).

<summary><b>Remove Office credentials</b></summary>

1.	From Start, type credential manager, and then select **Credential Manager** from the search results.
1.	Select **Windows credentials**.
1.	If there are any credentials for **MicrosoftOffice16**, select the arrow next to them and then select **Remove**.

<details>
<summary><b>Check BrokerPlugin process</b></summary>

Some antivirus, proxy, or firewall software might block the following plug-in process:

`Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy`

Temporarily disable your antivirus software. Contact your system administrator to find out if you are behind a proxy or firewall that is blocking this process. If so, you will also need to temporarily disable your proxy or firewall connection. If you connect through a Virtual Private Network (VPN), you might need to temporarily disable your VPN also.

If the process isn’t blocked, but you still can’t activate Microsoft 365, delete your BrokerPlugin data and then reinstall it using the following steps:

1.	Open File Explorer, and put the following location in the address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1.	Press CTRL + A to select all.
1.	Right-click in the selected files and choose **Delete**.
1.	Put the following location in the File Explorer address bar:
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.CloudExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\AC\TokenBroker\Accounts`
1.	Select all files and delete them.
1.	Restart the device.
1.	Download and run [the SaRA package for sign in issues](https://aka.ms/SaRA-OfficeSignInScenario).

For manual troubleshooting for step 7, or for more information, see [Fix authentication issues in Office applications when you try to connect to a Microsoft 365 service](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/authentication/automatic-authentication-fails).
