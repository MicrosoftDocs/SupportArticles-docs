# Microsoft 365 Apps activation Unlicensed product error

When you try to activate Microsoft 365 Apps, you might encounter an error that says you have an unlicensed product.

Try the following troubleshooting methods to solve the problem.

**Notes:**
- If your Microsoft 365 license didn't come from your work, school, or other organization, see [Unlicensed Product and activation errors in Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/unlicensed-product-and-activation-errors-in-office-0d23d3c0-c19c-4b2f-9845-5344fedc4380)
- Some of these troubleshooting methods can only be performed by a Microsoft 365 admin. If you aren’t an admin, see [How do I find my Microsoft 365 admin?](https://support.microsoft.com/office/how-do-i-find-my-microsoft-365-admin-59b8e361-dbb6-407f-8ac3-a30889e7b99b)
