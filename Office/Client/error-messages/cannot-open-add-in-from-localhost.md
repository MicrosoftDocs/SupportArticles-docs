# "We can't open this add-in from localhost" when loading an Office Add-in or using Fiddler

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you load an Office Add-in from https://localhost or when you use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler), you receive the following error:     

**We can't open this add-in from localhost.**

## Resolution

One cause of this error is that the Microsoft Edge Web Viewer does not have a loopback exemption. To resolve this issue, use either of these options to add a local loopback exemption to **Desktop App Web Viewer**:

### Option 1: Use command to add a local loopback exemption
 
1. Open a command prompt as administrator.     
2. Run the following command:
    ```powershell
    CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="microsoft.win32webviewhost_cw5n1h2txyewy" 
    ```

### Option 2: Use Fiddler to add a local loopback exemption

1. Select **Tools** > **Win8 Loopback Exemptions**.    
2. Add an exemption to **Desktop App Web Viewer**.
