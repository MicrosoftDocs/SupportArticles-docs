# "Incorrect function" when saving a file from an Office program to a CD-RW or a DVD/CD-RW drive

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to save a file in one of Office programs to a CD-RW or a DVD/CD-RW drive, the file is not saved. Additionally, you receive the following error message:

**Incorrect function.**

When you click **OK** in the error message, you receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
You do not have access to the folder 'drive:\'. See your administrator for access to this folder.
```

## Cause

This behavior occurs because Microsoft Office programs do not use the CD-ROM writing function that is available in some Microsoft Windows operating systems.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, install a third-party CD-ROM recording program. A third-party CD-ROM program lets the CD-ROM writing function that is available in Windows XP work with your Office program.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all third-party CD-ROM recording programs let you save a file from an Office program directly to a CD-RW or a DVD/CD-RW drive. In this case, you must save the file to the hard disk drive, and then use the CD-ROM recording program to burn the file to a CD-RW or a DVD/CD-RW drive.

For more information about how to do this with your third-party CD-ROM recording program, look at the documentation for the program.
