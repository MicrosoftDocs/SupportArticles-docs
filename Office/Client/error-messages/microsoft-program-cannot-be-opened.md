## Resolution

### Step 1: Check the program path

When the error message is displayed, view the comments under "Problem Details and System Configuration.". Note the "Path" that is listed in the error message, and then close the error message box. The path must be as follows:

1. Locate the Office 2008 folder.    
2. Click to select the folder.    
3. On the Finder menu, click **Edit**, and then select **Copy Microsoft Office 2008** or Copy Microsoft Office 2011.

### Step 2: Delete duplicate entries

To delete duplicate entries, follow these steps:

1. On the Finder menu, click **File**, and then click **Find**.    
2. In the search box, type the program name, and then press Enter. For example, type Excel.

    ![enter excel](./media/microsoft-program-cannot-be-opened/excel.jpg)
    
    ![enter outlook](./media/microsoft-program-cannot-be-opened/outlook.jpg)
3. In the results, look for duplicate instances of the Excel icon. If there is only one icon, go to "step 3". If there are several Excel icons, select a duplicate icon. On the Finder menu, click **File**, and then select **Move to Trash**.
