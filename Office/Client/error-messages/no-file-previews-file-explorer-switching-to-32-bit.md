# Office file previews in Windows Explorer may not show after switching from 64-bit Office to 32-bit Office

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

If a 64-bit version of Office 365 is installed, then uninstalled, and then a 32-bit version of Office 365 is subsequently installed, Windows Explorer may not show document previews.  Instead, an error may be shown:

- Word : "Word could not create the work file. Check the temp environment variable."
- PowerPoint : "Access denied. Contact your administrator."
- Excel : "This file cannot be previewed."
