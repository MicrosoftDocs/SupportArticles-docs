# Auto-Complete may not work

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

You type text in a cell in Microsoft Excel. The first few characters of the text that you type match an existing entry in that column. When this occurs, the Auto-Complete feature may not automatically fill in the remaining characters.

## Cause

In Microsoft Excel, the Auto-Complete feature may not fill in the remaining characters if the algorithm that Excel uses detects a header row in the list.

## More Information

### Example

When you use the steps in the following example, the Auto-Complete feature does not appear to function properly.

1. Save and close any open workbooks, and then create a new workbook.
2. In cell A1, type **ABC** in uppercase.
3. In cell A2, type **a** in lowercase and do not press ENTER.

   The Auto-Complete feature automatically inserts **aBC** in cell A2.

4. Continue typing abc in lowercase in cell A2, and then press ENTER.

   This overwrites the text that is suggested by Auto-Complete.

5. In cell B1, type **ABC** in uppercase.
6. In cell B2, type **a** in lowercase and do not press ENTER.

   The Auto-Complete feature does not automatically suggest "aBC" in cell B2 as it does in step 3.

Because the characters in cell A1 are all uppercase, and the characters in cell A2 are all lowercase, Microsoft Excel determines that row 1 is a list header row. The algorithm for the Auto-Complete feature does not generate suggested text if the first row is considered a list header row. This behavior also occurs if characters in cell A2 are uppercase and lowercase.
