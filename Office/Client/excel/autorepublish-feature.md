# How to use the Auto-Republish feature in Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

This step-by-step article explains how to use the Auto-Republish feature in Microsoft Excel. This feature lets you automatically update a Web page as the workbook from which it was created is updated. 

Auto-Republish is an automatic link from a Web page to an Excel workbook. When Auto-Republish is enabled, the Web page is automatically updated every time that the workbook from which it was created is saved.

### How to enable Auto-Republish

To enable the Auto-Republish feature, follow these steps, as appropriate for the version of Excel that you are running.

#### Microsoft Excel 2002 and Microsoft Office Excel 2003


1. Start Excel, and then open or create the workbook that you want to save as a Web page.   
2. Click **Save as Web Page**.   
3. Click Publish.   
4. In the **File name** box, type the path and the file name that you want.   
5. Click to select the **Auto-Republish every time this workbook is saved** check box, and then click Publish.   

#### Microsoft Office Excel 2007

1. Start Excel, and then open or create the workbook that you want to save as a Web page.   
2. Click the ![ Microsoft Office Button  ](./media/autorepublish-feature/office-2007-file-button.jpg), and then click **Save As**.   
3. In **Save as type** list, click **Web Page**.   
4. In the **File name** box, type the path and the file name that you want.   
5. Click **Publish**.   
6. Click to select the **Auto-Republish every time this workbook is saved** check box, and then click **Publish**.   

### Troubleshooting

You know that Auto-Republish is working if you receive a confirmation message that resembles the following message the next time that you save the workbook after publishing:

This workbook contains items that are automatically republished to Web pages each time the workbook is saved.

- Disable the Auto-Republish feature while this workbook is open

- Enable the Auto-Republish feature. You may also receive this confirmation message if the workbook that you are saving contains a chart sheet, Microsoft Excel 4 macro sheets, or Microsoft Excel 5 dialog sheets. 

If you click **Enable the Auto-Republish feature**, a warning message appears in a generic Excel warning message box or error message box. The warning states that the workbook contains a chart sheet, Excel 4 macro sheets, or Excel 5 dialog sheets. For more information about the warning and what, if anything, your options are in this case, click Help on the warning message.
