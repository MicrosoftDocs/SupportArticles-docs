# The "Center Across Columns" button doesn't appear on the toolbar or on the Ribbon in Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Excel 2000, in Microsoft Excel 2002, and in Microsoft Office Excel 2003, the Center Across Columns button does not appear on the Formatting toolbar. In Microsoft Office Excel 2007, a Center Across Columns button does not appear on the **Home** tab.

## Workaround

Although the Center Across Columns toolbar button is no longer available, you can still center text across columns without merging cells. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the range of cells over which you want to center text.
2. Right-click the selected cells, and then click **Format Cells**.
3. Click the Alignment tab.
4. In the Horizontal list, click Center Across Selection.
5. Click OK.

## More Information

The Merge and Center toolbar button in Excel provides a level of functionality that is very similar to the functionality provided by the "Center Across Columns" toolbar button in versions of Microsoft Excel earlier than Excel 97. The button allows you to center information contained in a single cell across a range of cells.
