# COM add-ins are not displayed in the COM Add-Ins dialog box in Excel 2013 and Excel 2016

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

You try to enable one of the following COM add-ins installed with Microsoft Excel 2013 and Microsoft Excel 2016:

- Microsoft Office PowerPivot for Excel 2013 and Excel 2016   
- Power View   

To do this, you click Options, click Add-Ins, select **Com Add-Ins** in the Manage list, and then click **Go**. In this situation, the COM add-ins do not appear in the COM Add-Ins dialog box as expected. 

## Cause

This issue occurs because the registry keys that provide the add-in information to the Add-in Manager are damaged or set to invalid values. See More Information for the Office 2013 and Office 2016 SKUs that contain these add-ins.

## Resolution
