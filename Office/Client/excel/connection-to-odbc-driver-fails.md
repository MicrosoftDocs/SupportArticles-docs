# Connection to ODBC driver fails in PowerPivot for Excel 2010 or PowerPivot for Excel 2013

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Assume that you try to connect to a database by using Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers in the PowerPivot for Microsoft Excel 2010 or PowerPivot for Microsoft Excel 2013 add-in. You create the connection string by using the Table Import Wizard. The connection test is successful. However, when you click **Next**, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Failed to connect to the server. Reason: ERROR [28000] [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Login failed for user ''.
ERROR [01S00] [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Invalid connection string attribute
ERROR [28000] [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Login failed for user ''.
ERROR [01S00] [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Invalid connection string attribute
```

The following is a sample of the connection string that you created:

```adoc
Provider=MSDASQL.1;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Initial Catalog=test;DSN=MSSQL 2012;Password=**********
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Extended Properties information is not contained in the ODBC connection string. The following is a sample of the correct connection string:

```adoc
Provider=MSDASQL;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Extended Properties="DSN=MSSQL 2012;UID=sa;APP=Microsoft Office 2013;WSID=GENLI-T430;DATABASE=test;Pwd=**********";Initial Catalog=test;Password=**********
```

## Resolution

To create a correct connection string, select the **Use connection string** option when you create the connection string:

1. In the **Table Import Wizard**, click **Build**.   
2. In the **Provider** tab, make sure that you select Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers.   
3. In the **Connection** tab, select the **User connection string** option, and then click **Build**.

4. Click the **Machine Data Source** tab, select your database resource, and then click **OK**.   
5. When you receive the Database logon prompt, type the logon ID and password, and then click **OK**.    
6. In the **Enter information to log on to the server** box, type in the logon ID and password again, and then select the **Allow saving password** option.   
7. Click **OK**. A correct connection string is generated.
