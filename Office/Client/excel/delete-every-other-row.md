2. In a new worksheet, in the range A1:A9, type the numbers 1 to 5, skipping rows, as in the following example: 

    ```excel
    A1: 1
    A2:
    A3: 2
    A4:
    A5: 3
    A6:
    A7: 4
    A8:
    A9: 5
    ```

4. On the Insert menu, click Module.    
5. In the new module, type the following macro: 

```vb
Sub Delete_Every_Other_Row()

' Dimension variables.
   Y = False              ' Change this to True if you want to
                          ' delete rows 1, 3, 5, and so on.
   I = 1
   Set xRng = Selection

' Loop once for every row in the selection.
   For xCounter = 1 To xRng.Rows.Count

' If Y is True, then...
       If Y = True Then

' ...delete an entire row of cells.
           xRng.Cells(I).EntireRow.Delete

' Otherwise...
       Else

' ...increment I by one so we can cycle through range.
           I = I + 1

End If

' If Y is True, make it False; if Y is False, make it True.
       Y = Not Y

Next xCounter

End Sub
```

6. Switch to the worksheet that contains the data, and then select the range A1:A9.
