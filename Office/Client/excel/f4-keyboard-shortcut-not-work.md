## Symptoms

The F4 keyboard shortcut does not work as expected in Microsoft Excel 2013, Excel 2010, or Excel 2007. 

For example, when you sort a row (row A), and then you press F4 to repeat the action on another row (row B), row B is not sorted. Or, when you copy and paste a cell, and then you press F4, the cell is pasted. However, when you press F4 again, the cell is not pasted.

## Workaround

If you cannot use the F4 keyboard shortcut to repeat a command or action, manually perform the command or action that you want to repeat.
