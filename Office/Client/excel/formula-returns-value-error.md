# SUMIF, COUNTIF, and COUNTBLANK functions return "#VALUE!" Error

## Symptoms

A formula that contains the **SUMIF**, **SUMIFS**, **COUNTIF**, **COUNTIFS**, or **COUNTBLANK** functions may return the "#VALUE!" error in Microsoft Excel.

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior also applies to the Dfunctions, such as **DAVERAGE**, **DCOUNT**, **DCOUNTA**, **DGET**, **DMAX**, **DMIN**, **DPRODUCT**, **DSTDEV**, **DSTDEVP**, **DSUM**, **DVAR**, and **DVARP**. **OFFSET** and **INDIRECT** functions also have this behavior.

## Cause

This behavior occurs when the formula that contains the function refers to cells in a closed workbook and the cells are calculated.

> [!NOTE]
> If you open the referenced workbook, the formula works correctly.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, use a combination of the SUM and IF functions together in an array formula.

### Examples

> [!NOTE]
> You must enter each formula as an array formula. To enter an array formula in Microsoft Excel for Windows, press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER.

#### SUMIF

Instead of using a formula that is similar to the following:

> =SUMIF([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8,"a",[Source]Sheet1!$B$1:$B$8)

Use the following formula:

> =SUM(IF([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8="a",[Source]Sheet1!$B$1:$B$8,0))

#### COUNTIF

Instead of using a formula that is similar to the following:

> =COUNTIF([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8,"a")

use the following formula:

> =SUM(IF([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8="a",1,0))

#### COUNTBLANK

Instead of using a formula that is similar to the following:

> =COUNTBLANK([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8)

use the following formula:

> =SUM(IF([Source]Sheet1!$A$1:$A$8="",1,0))

When to use a **SUM(IF())** array formula, use a logical **AND** or **OR** to replace the SUMIFS or COUNTIFS function.

## Status

This behavior is by design.

## More information

The SUMIF function uses the following syntax:

> =SUMIF(range, criteria, sum_range).
