# Sample user-defined function to hide formula errors in Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

Some formulas in Microsoft Excel return error values under certain conditions. For example, when you use a division formula that multiplies a number by zero, you receive the following error value:

**#DIV/0!**

Using the sample formula "=100/0", you can work around this behavior by hiding the error value. To do this, modify the formula as follows:

```excel
=IF(ISERROR(100/0),"",100/0)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The preceding formula works, but with longer formulas it can become cumbersome.

With the user-defined function that is provided in this article, the workaround formula is as follows:

```excel
=IFERROR(100/0,"")
```

### How to create the sample function

1. In Excel, open the Microsoft Visual Basic Editor.

    To do this in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and in earlier versions of Excel, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click Visual Basic Editor. Alternatively, press ALT+F11.

    To do this in Microsoft Office Excel 2007, click the **Developer** tab, and then click
    **Visual Basic** in the **Code** group. Alternatively, press ALT + F11. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > To show the **Developer** tab in the Ribbon, click the
    **Microsoft Office Button**, click **Excel Options**, click the **Popular** category, click to select the **Show Developer tab in the Ribbon** check box, and then click **OK**.  
2. Click Module on the Insert menu, and then type the following macro.

    ```vb
    Function IfError(formula As Variant, show As String)
    
         On Error GoTo ErrorHandler
    
         If IsError(formula) Then
            IfError = show
        Else
            IfError = formula
        End If
    
        Exit Function
    
    ErrorHandler:
        Resume Next
    
    End Function
    ```

3. On the File menu, click **Close and Return to Microsoft Excel**.
4. To use the function, click Insert Function on the Insert menu. In the Insert Function dialog box, click User Defined under Categories, and then click IfError under Select a function. Click OK.
5. Next to Formula, type the formula for which you want to hide the error value. Do not include the equal sign (=).    
6. Next to Show, type what you want to show in place of the error value. If you want to hide the error value, type double quotes ("").
7. Click OK.
