##  Symptoms

Consider this scenario:

You are using an Office application (Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint) and you insert a hyperlink to a MHT file on a file share. When you click the link to follow it, Internet Explorer starts, but the MHT file is not loaded. Instead you see an error:

The address is not valid.

Most likely causes:

##  Cause

There are spaces in the path or file name in the URL.

##  More Information

Web files (.HTM, .HTML, .ASP, .MHT, .MHTML, etc.) are most frequently stored on web servers, which are designed to use URL encoding to deal with spaces. If you access your .MHT files from a web server, they will load properly with or without spaces in the path.
