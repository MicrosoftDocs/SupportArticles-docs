# Hyperlinks stop working after you save as a PDF in Office 2011

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you save one of the following Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 file types as a PDF, hyperlinks no longer work in the converted file:

- Excel 2016 for Mac or Excel for Mac 2011 workbook   
- PowerPoint 2016 for Mac or PowerPoint for Mac 2011 presentation   
- Word 2016 for Mac or Word for Mac 2011 document   

## Cause

This issue occurs because metadata is not maintained during the conversion to the PDF format.

## Status

Microsoft is aware of this issue and may produce a solution in an upcoming product release or service pack.
