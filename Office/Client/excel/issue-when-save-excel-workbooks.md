# Troubleshoot why Excel doesn't save changes

As you work in a workbook, Microsoft Excel saves the file automatically. It gives the file a temporary file name, and puts the file into the same folder as the original version. When you manually save the workbook, the original file is deleted, and the temporary file is assigned the original file name.

If this process is interrupted, the workbook might not save correctly. You might also find one or more temporary files in the folder where you tried to save your file. Additionally, you may receive one of several alerts or error messages.

The following information can help you identify possible causes of this problem, and proposes solutions to help you solve the problem.

## Possible reasons why documents don't save

Select the tab that applies to you, or go to the "[Quick resolution](#quick-resolution)" section.

## [3rd-party add-ins](#tab/third-party)

If you cannot save a workbook when you run Microsoft Excel in Windows Safe mode, the problem may be caused by a third-party add-in or by a file from one of the Excel startup locations. By default, startup files are loaded when you start Excel.

Some add-ins from third-party software vendors work together with existing Excel features by design, and some are intended to enable a seamless transition when you use a third-party product. Typically, these third-party add-ins do not interfere with Excel functionality. However, some functions, such as saving a file can be affected.

To test for and eliminate the possibility that a third-party Excel add-in or file is causing a "save" problem in Excel, try to save the file in Safe mode. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Exit Excel.
2. Select **Start**, and point to **Programs**.
3. As Excel starts, press and hold **Ctrl** until you receive a message that resembles the following:

    **Excel has detected that you are holding down the Ctrl key. Do you want to start Excel in safe mode?**
4. Select **Yes**.
5. Open a new Excel workbook, and try to save it. If that works, try again to save the problem file.

If the file now saves correctly, a custom add-in or a file that is located in an Excel startup location is most likely the cause. You must locate and remove the add-in or the file to eliminate the problem. After you determine which add-in or file caused the problem, contact the vendor for additional information or an update that resolves the problem.

For more information about Microsoft Excel safe mode, press **F1** in Excel to open the Help menu, type **safe mode** in the **Search** box, and then select **Search** to view the topic.

For more information about how to determine the folders that Excel uses during startup, and additional options to disable this functionality, see the following articles:

- [Use startup folders in Excel](use-startup-folders.md)
- [How to prevent files from opening automatically in Excel](files-open-automatically.md)

## [Permissions](#tab/restricted)

When you save an Excel file, you must have the following permissions to the folder in which you are saving the file:

- Read permission
- Write permission
- Modify permission
- Delete permission

**Cannot access read-only document \<file name>**

This error message is displayed if you try to make changes to a file to which you have only read permissions. This is because the administrator or the owner of the file has not granted you permission to edit the file. If the file does not have the ”read-only” tag but this error message continues to appear while you try to save the file, either of the following reasons might be the cause:

- You open an existing file, and then try to save it.
- You save the file to an external or network drive, and the connection fails.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have the listed permissions, the Excel "save" process can't be completed.

## [Document not saved](#tab/notsaved)

You see one of the following error messages:

- Document not saved
- Document not completely saved
- Document not saved. Any previously saved copy has been deleted.
- The document is not saved.

**“Document not saved” or “Document not completely saved”**

The process was interrupted while it tried to create a temporary file, possibly because of one of the following reasons:

- The ESC key was pressed
- Hardware failure
- Software failure
- A problem with media

The original file is still intact. Unless your computer or workstation failed, the version of the file that contains your current changes is still open in memory.

Try saving the file to an alternative drive.

> [!note]
> Any changes made in the last revision will be lost.

**“Document not saved. Any previously saved copy has been deleted” or “The document is not saved”**

The process was interrupted while it was deleting the original file or renaming the temporary file. This problem occurs for the same reasons that are described in the "'Document not saved’ or ‘Document not completely saved'" section.

In this case, your original file is deleted (although the temporary file may be readable). If your computer or workstation failed, use the temporary file. If the interruption was caused by something else, the version of the file that contains your current changes is still open in memory. Save the file to an alternative drive.

## [Disk space](#tab/ins-disk-space)

When you save to any medium, such as a hard disk, an external storage drive, or a network drive, you must make sure that the disk has sufficient free space to enable the file to save. If the destination does not have sufficient space, Excel cannot complete the "save" operation, and you receive the following error message:

> **Disk is Full.**

For more information about this error message, see the following articles:

- [You receive the "Disk is Full" error message when you save a workbook in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/help/214245/you-receive-the-disk-is-full-error-message-when-you-save-a-workbook-in)
  
## [Antivirus software](#tab/antivirus)

When antivirus software is installed or is running, you may receive an error message when you try to save an existing workbook, but not when you try to save a new file. You may receive the error message because some antivirus programs quickly scan any new files that appear on a computer. This scan can sometimes interrupt the Excel "save" process and may stop Excel from saving the file correctly.

To check whether your antivirus software conflicts with Excel, temporarily deactivate the antivirus software, and then try to save the Excel file.

## [File sharing](#tab/file-share-conflict)

If you and a second user work concurrently on a shared workbook, you may receive an error message if you and the second user try to save the file at the same time. You receive an error message because Excel cannot save the file if another instance of Excel is saving the same file.

For more information about this error message, see [Unlock a file that has been locked for editing](https://support.microsoft.com/office/unlock-a-file-that-has-been-locked-for-editing-bdda0d41-1b8e-44ed-a6ae-6d095d37c22d?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us).

## [File naming](#tab/file-name-length)

If you try to save or open an Excel file, and the path of that file (including the file name) is more than 218 characters, you may receive the following error message:

**Filename is not valid.**

For more information, see [Error message when you open or save a file in Microsoft Excel: "Filename is not valid"](https://support.microsoft.com/help/213983).

### Process to save a file

Excel follows these steps when it saves a file:

1. Excel creates a randomly named temporary file (for example, Cedd4100 without a file name extension) in the destination folder that you specified in the **Save As** dialog box. The whole workbook is written to the temporary file.
2. If changes are being saved to an existing file, Excel deletes the original file.
3. Excel renames the temporary file. Excel gives the temporary file the file name that you specified (such as Book1.xls) in the **Save As** dialog box.

For more information, see [Description of the way that Excel saves files](https://support.microsoft.com/help/814068).

> [!NOTE]
> Other processes that occur on your computer can disrupt the Excel “save” process. These problems might occur if the Excel temporary file is accessed before the Excel “save” process is completed. For example, the local antivirus software locks the temporary file for scanning before the file can be renamed. Therefore, you should track all new software installations and updates. Information about such processes that were run before you experienced this problem can be helpful if this article does not fix your problem and you have to contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com).

### Workarounds to save Excel workbooks

To work around this problem and try to save your work before you troubleshoot, use the following methods. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may be unable to recover the current file as-is. However, the following methods are typically successful. These methods are listed in order of format retention when you are trying to keep the original file formatting.

> [!NOTE]
> The following methods may not save all the latest changes, formatting, and feature sets of the workbook that are specific to the version of Excel that you are using. The following methods are intended to let you obtain a usable, saved version of the file. These methods require you to save the file to your local hard disk by using a unique file name.  

<a id="option1">

## Option 1: Save the workbook by using a new file name

</a>

1. On the **File** menu, select **Save As**.
2. Save the Excel workbook by using a unique file name.

## Option 2: Move the original worksheets to a new workbook

</a>

1. Add a filler worksheet to your workbook. To do this, press Shift+F11.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This sheet is required because there must be at least one remaining sheet in a workbook after you move all relevant data sheets.
2. Group all the worksheets (except the filler). To do this, select the first data sheet, hold the **Shift** key, and then select the last data sheet.
3. Right-select the grouped sheets, and then select **Move or copy**.
4. In the **To Book** list, select **(New Book)**.
5. Select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > These steps should move the active (grouped) worksheets to a new workbook.

If your workbook contains VBA macros, copy the modules from the old workbook to the new workbook.

<a id="option3">

## Option 3: Save the file as a different Excel file type

</a>

1. On the **File** menu, select **Save As**.
2. In the **Save as Type** list, select a file format other than the current file format. If you are using Microsoft Excel 2007 or a later version, save the file as .xlsx or .xlsm instead of as .xls.

<a id="option4">

## Option 4: Try to save the workbook to another location

</a>

Try to save the workbook to another location, such as a local hard disk, a network drive, or a removable drive. If you are successful, the following are possible causes of the problem:

- Antivirus software conflict
- Restricted permissions
- File name length
- File sharing conflict

<a id="option5">

## Option 5: Try to save a new workbook to the original location

</a>

To save a new Excel file to the original location, follow these steps:

1. Create an Excel workbook.
2. On the **File** menu, select **Save As**.
3. In the **Save As** dialog box, follow these steps:

   1. In the **Save in** box, select the location in which the original workbook is saved.

   3. Select **Save**.

 If you can save a new workbook to the original location, the following are possible causes of the problem:

- File name length
- File sharing conflict

If you can't save a new workbook to the original location, the following is a possible cause of the problem:

- Insufficient drive space

If you have sufficient drive space, try Option 3.

<a id="option6">

## Option 6: Try to save the workbook in safe mode

</a>

Restart Windows in safe mode, and then try to save the workbook to your local hard disk.

**Notes**

- If you use a network location to save your workbook, try to restart Windows in safe mode with network support, and then try to save.
- Windows safe mode cannot be used to troubleshoot problems in Microsoft Excel 2010 or later versions.

For more information about how to start Windows in safe mode, see [Advanced startup options (including safe mode)](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7).

If the workbook saves after you restart Windows in safe mode, try again to save the file. To do this, select **Save** on the **File** menu.

If the workbook doesn't save after you restart Windows in safe mode, the following are possible causes:

- Third-party add-ins
- Antivirus software conflict
- Restricted permissions
- File name length
