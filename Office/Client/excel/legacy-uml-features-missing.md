# Legacy UML features are missing when you edit a UML or database diagram in Visio 2013

## Introduction 

Assume that you try to edit a UML or database diagram that was created in Visio 2010 or in an earlier version of Visio by using Microsoft Visio 2013. However, the legacy UML features are missing. Additionally, you receive the following message in the message bar and in the information pane: 

```adoc
This UML Model Diagram was created with a feature that is not supported in this version of Visio. Editing of the diagram is limited and may result in the diagram not working in earlier versions of Visio.
```

## More Information

This issue occurs because Visio 2013 uses new UML and database modeling templates that are not used by Visio 2010 or by earlier versions of Visio. Therefore, you can edit a UML or database diagram that is created in Visio 2010 or in an earlier version of Visio by using Visio 2013. However, the diagram does not work correctly when you open it in Visio 2010 or in an earlier version of Visio. Additionally, the diagram cannot be automatically upgraded to a new format in Visio 2013.
