# Excel macros that protect and unprotect worksheets may run slowly

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

Macros in Microsoft Excel 2013 run slower than in earlier versions of Excel. For example, you may notice that .xlsm files open very slowly or that it takes a long time to move to the next cell when you enter data in cells.

##  Cause

Because of a new, stronger hashing algorithm (SHA-512) for encryption in Microsoft Office 2013, macros that protect worksheets and unprotect worksheets run slower if they protect or unprotect several worksheets sequentially.

##  Resolution

This behavior is by design. It's not noticeable when you're manually protecting a worksheet. However, if you have code that protects or unprotects work sheets repeatedly, this behavior can cause a performance issue.

##  More Information

The delay is caused by a stronger hashing algorithm (SHA-512) than is present in earlier versions. (The default hashing algorithm to protect files by requiring a password in Office 2010 is SHA1.) This change can cause a performance issue for some Office developers.
