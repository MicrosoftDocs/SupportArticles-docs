## Summary

After you perform a copy-and-paste operation in Microsoft Excel, the Paste Options button is displayed near the paste destination. This step-by-step article explains how to make the Paste Options button disappear and how to prevent options from appearing.

### How to make the Paste Options button disappear

The Paste Options button is displayed until one of the following actions occurs:

- You perform an action that can be undone. This action differs from those that are listed in the Paste Options list.
