# How to manage multiple windows in Excel

## Summary

In Microsoft Excel, you can open multiple windows into a workbook (document). By doing so, you can gain access to different areas of your workbook simultaneously. 

## More information

Opening multiple windows into a workbook provides an easy way to view or work with different areas of your workbook simultaneously. Any changes made in any of the windows are made to the workbook. 

You can save multiple windows into a workbook by saving it while multiple windows are open. To remove windows that have been saved with your workbook, close all multiple windows, and then save your document. 

To open multiple windows into a workbook, follow these steps: 


1. Start Microsoft Excel and open any workbook.   
2. In Microsoft Office Excel 2007, click the **View** tab, and then click **New Window** in the **Window** group. 

    In Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and in earlier versions of Excel, click New Window on the Window menu.  

Notice that a new window displays the active workbook. You can browse to different areas of the workbook in the separate windows, and changes made in one window are evident in the others.

> [!NOTE]
> The name on the title bar of each window changes to indicate that these are multiple windows of the same workbook (for example, Book1:1 and Book1:2). 

To close multiple windows, click the Close button in the upper-right corner of the window or press CTRL+F4.

> [!NOTE]
> When you have closed all multiple windows, the workbook name no longer displays a window number.

Excel also allows you to create custom views; a custom view gives you a great deal of flexibility in viewing and editing your workbooks.
