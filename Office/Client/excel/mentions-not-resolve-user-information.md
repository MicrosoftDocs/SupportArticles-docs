# User information in @mentions doesn't resolve

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, if you mention a user by using the @ sign followed by the user's name or email alias, the user doesn't resolve.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the user is hidden from the global address list (GAL) in Microsoft Exchange Server or Exchange Online.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use one of the methods, as appropriate for your situation.

**Note:** The following steps must be done by an administrator.

### Method 1: Mailboxes are in Exchange Online in a non-hybrid configuration

1. [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell).
2. Check the `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled` property by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    $User = Get-Mailbox -Identity john@contoso.com
    $User.HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled
    ```

3. Set the property value to **False** by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-Mailbox -Identity john@contoso.com -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $false
    ```

### Method 2: Mailboxes are in Exchange Online in a hybrid configuration

1. [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).
2. Check the `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled` property by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    $User = Get-RemoteMailbox -Identity john@contoso.com
    $User.HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled
    ```

3. Set the property value to **False** by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-RemoteMailbox -Identity john@contoso.com -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $false
    ```

### Method 3: Mailboxes are in Exchange Server in a hybrid configuration

1. [Open the Exchange Management Shell](/powershell/exchange/open-the-exchange-management-shell).
2. Check the `HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled` property by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    $User = Get-Mailbox -Identity john@contoso.com
    $User.HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled
    ```

3. Set the property value to **False** by running the following cmdlet:

    ```powershell
    Set-Mailbox -Identity john@contoso.com -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $false
    ```
