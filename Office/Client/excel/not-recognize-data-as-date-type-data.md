# Excel 2013 does not recognize data as Date type data after you import the data from a SQL Server data source to an Excel workbook

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You use the Microsoft SQL OLE DB Provider to import data from a SQL Server data source to a Microsoft Excel 2013 workbook.   
- The SQL Server data source contains a Date type column.   
- You use the data to create a PivotTable in Excel 2013.   
- You try to insert a timeline into the PivotTable.   

In this scenario, you cannot select the cell range that contains the data in the Insert Timeline dialog box.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the SQL OLE DB Provider returns the String data type if the data source contains a Date, Time, or DateTime2 type column. In this situation, Excel 2013 cannot recognize the data as the Date type. 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods: 

- Change the column type to DateTime in the SQL Server data source.   
- Use an Open Database ConnectivityÂ (ODBC) driver to import the data.
