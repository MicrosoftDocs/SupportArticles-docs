# Paste Special option is missing or not working in Microsoft Office

The **Paste Special** option can make the task of pasting text go more smoothly by letting you choose which formatting you want to keep (source or destination) or by stripping all the formatting and just pasting the text. If you are having issues with the **Paste Special** option, continue on to the resolutions below.

## Resolution

To see if the **Paste Special** option is enabled: 
 
1. Go to **File** > **Options** > **Advanced**.    
2. Under **Cut, copy and paste**, ensure the **Show Paste Options button when content is pasted** option is checked. 

> [!NOTE]
> Using the `Worksheet_SelectionChange` event will clear the clipboard, which disables the **Paste Special** option. To enable the option, you need to set the value of the `Application.EnableEvents` property to `False`.

Ensure that all instances of the web browsers that you use are closed and try to use the **Paste Special** option again. Paste special will not function if your web browser is causing the conflict. Windows Internet Explorer (8-9) do not conflict with the **Paste Special** option in Excel 2010. Third party Add-ins can cause a variety of issues, one of then being, conflicting with the **Paste Special** option. To determine if an add-in is causing the issue:

1. Find the Microsoft Excel icon.   
2. Press and hold the CTRL key and double-click the application shortcut.
3. Click **Yes** when a window appears asking if you want to [start the application in Safe Mode](https://support.microsoft.com/office/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have an icon on your desktop, hold the CTRL key and click on the icon. This works with any Microsoft Office product.
 
4. If the **Paste Special** option works in the Safe Mode as follows, enable your Add-ins one by one until you hit that one that is causing the conflict. Leave that one disabled or uninstall it.

   > [!NOTE]
