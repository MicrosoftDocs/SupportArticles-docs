# An active Excel process continues to run after using a VBA macro to programmatically quit Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you run a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro to programmatically exit Microsoft Excel, Excel appears to close as expected. However, an active Excel process continues to run.

This behavior may occur even when your VBA macro performs the following functions:

- Closes all open workbooks
- Calls the Quit method to exit Excel
- Sets the Excel object to "nothing"

## Cause

This behavior may occur if the following conditions are true:

- A COM add-in is installed in Excel.
- The COM add-in assigns an Excel or an Excel member reference to a global object.

For example, this behavior is known to occur when the Google Desktop search tool is installed in Excel. For more information about the Google Desktop search tool, visit the following Google Web site:
