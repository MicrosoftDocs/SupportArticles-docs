# Run-time error-2147467259 (80004005) when you set a property of a chart

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a macro that sets a property of a chart in Microsoft Excel. For example, the macro sets the MaximumScale, MinimumScale, Title, Axis, or Legendproperty of a chart.
- You protect the worksheet. When you do this, you click to select the **Edit objects** check box in the **Protect Sheet** dialog box.
- You run the macro.

In this scenario, you receive an error message that resembles one of the following.

Error message 1

```adoc
Run-time error '-2147467259 (80004005)':

Method 'MaximumScale' of object 'Axis' failed
```

Error message 2

```adoc
Run-time error '-2147467259 (80004005)':

Automation error

Unspecified error
```

## Cause

This problem occurs because the Excel object model for the chart is disabled on a protected worksheet.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, unprotect the worksheet to enable the macro to run. You can manually unprotect the worksheet or by using the **Unprotect** method in the macro.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.
