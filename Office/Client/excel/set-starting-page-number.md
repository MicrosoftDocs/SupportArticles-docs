[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

The starting page number for a Microsoft Excel document can be changed by clicking the Page Setup command. Using the following commands in the header or footer prints a starting page number other than 1.

|Command|Description|
|----------|----------|
|&P+##|Substitute a number for the number signs (#) to increment the page numbers by that amount.|
|&P-##|Substitute a number for the number signs (#) to decrement the page numbers by that amount.|

For example, to start page numbering at page 3, type the following in the header or footer section of the Page Setup dialog box:

"&P+2" (without the quotation marks)

> [!NOTE]
> You must type a space after the 2 in this example.
