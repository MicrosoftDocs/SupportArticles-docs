# Excel/Outlook for Mac: Border missing when pasting table in email

## Symptoms

When you create a table in Microsoft Excel for Mac and copy it into a new email message in Microsoft Outlook for Mac, the table is pasted into the email without any borders.

## Cause

This is a known issue in Office 2011 for Mac and Office 2016 for Mac.

## Resolution

Microsoft is currently investigating this issue.

To work around this problem follow these steps:

1. In Excel, select your table.
2. Click the button to **Apply borders to the selection**.
3. Select the **Thick Box Border** option.
4. Copy and paste the table into your email message.

You can also select the **Thick Box Border** option before you create your table.

The table borders will be displayed as regular borders in the email when you copy it.
