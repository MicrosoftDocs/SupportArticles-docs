## Action

Using Team Explorer 2008 you try to open a work item or collection of work items in Microsoft Excel via the menu item "Open Selection in Microsoft Excel" or "Open in Microsoft Excel".

## Result

You receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
Unable to cast COM object of type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.ApplicationClass' to interface type 'Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel._Application'. This operation failed because the QueryInterface call on the COM component for the interface with IID '{000208D5-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}' failed due to the following error: The interface is unknown. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706B5).
```

1. Open a command prompt and CD to %programfiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 9\Common7\IDE\
(path assumes you have Visual Studio 2008 installed in the default location; adjust accordingly).
