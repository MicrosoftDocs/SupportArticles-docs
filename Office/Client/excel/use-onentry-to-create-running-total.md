# Use the OnEntry macro to create a running total in a cell comment in Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

In Microsoft Excel you can avoid circular references when you create a running total by storing the result in a non-calculating part of a worksheet. This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications procedure that does this by storing a running total in a cell comment.

### To Create a Running Total in a Cell

1. Open a new workbook in Microsoft Excel.   
2. Start the Visual Basic Editor (press ALT+F11).   
3. On the **Insert** menu, click **Module**.   
4. Type the following macros into this module:

    ```vb
       ' The Auto_Open name forces this macro to run every time
       ' the workbook containing this macro is opened.
   
    Sub Auto_Open()
       '  Every time a cell's value is changed,
       '  the RunningTotal macro runs.
          Application.OnEntry = "RunningTotal"
       End Sub
     
       '----------------------------------------------------------
       ' This macro runs each time the value of a cell changes.
       ' It adds the current value of the cell to the value of the
       ' cell comment. Then it stores the new total in the cell comment.
       Sub RunningTotal()
    
    On Error GoTo errorhandler      ' Skip cells that have no comment.
    
    With Application.Caller
    
       '     Checks to see if the cell is a running total by
       '     checking to see if the first 4 characters of the cell
       '     comment are "RT= ". NOTE: there is a space after the equal
       '     sign.
             If Left(.Comment.Text, 4) = "RT= " Then
    
       '        Change the cell's value to the new value in the cell
       '        plus the old total stored in the cell comment.
                RT = .Value + Right(.Comment.Text, Len(.Comment.Text) - 4)
                .Value = RT
    
       '        Store the new total in the cell note.
                .Comment.Text Text:="RT= " & RT
            End If
          End With
    
    Exit Sub      ' Skip over the errorhandler routine.
    
    errorhandler: ' End the procedure if no comment in the cell.
          Exit Sub
    
    End Sub
    
       '--------------------------------------------------------------
       ' This macro sets up a cell to be a running total cell.
       Sub SetComment()
          With ActiveCell
       '     Set comment to indicate that a running total is present.
       '     If the ActiveCell is empty, multiplying by 1 will
       '     return a 0.
             .AddComment
             .Comment.Text Text:="RT= " & (ActiveCell * 1)
          End With
       End Sub
    ```

5. After typing the macros, click **Close and Return to Microsoft Excel** on the **File** menu.   
6. Save and close your the workbook, and then re-open it.

    The Auto_Open macro that you typed is run when you open the workbook.    
7. Select cell C3.

    This is the cell that will contain a comment with the running total.           
8. Follow these steps to run the SetComment macro: 

    1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.   
    2. In the Macro dialog box, click SetComment, and then click Run.   

### An Example of Using the Running Total

To use the running total, follow these steps: 

1. Type the number 10 in cell C3.   
2. Select cell C3 and notice the comment displays "RT= 10" (without the quotation marks).   
3. Type the number 7 in cell C3.   
4. Select cell C3 and notice the comment displays "RT= 17" (without the quotation marks).   

### To Remove the Running Total

To remove the running total, follow these steps: 

1. Select the cell that contains the running total that you want removed.   
2. Right-click the cell and click Delete Comment on the shortcut menu.
