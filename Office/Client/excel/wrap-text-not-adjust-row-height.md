# Wrap text does not adjust row height in Excel

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Excel, if you manually modify the height of a row and then format a cell in that row to wrap text, Excel does not change the height of the row to fit all the text in the cell. 

## Cause

This behavior occurs if you have manually modified the height of the row. 

## Workaround

To adjust the height of the row to fit all the text in a cell, follow these steps: 

1. Select the row you want to adjust the height.    
2. In Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and in earlier versions of Excel, point to **Row** on the **Format** menu, and then click **AutoFit**.

    In Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and later versions, click the **Home** tab, click **Format**in the **Cells** group, and then click **AutoFit Row Height**.   

If your Excel sheet contains merged cells, visit the following Microsoft website:

[You cannot use the AutoFit feature for rows or columns that contain merged cells in Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/help/212010) 

## Status

This behavior is by design.
