# Resolve file upload errors in Microsoft Forms

Files that are uploaded through Microsoft Forms are stored in Microsoft SharePoint or in OneDrive for work or school, as follows:

- Files that are uploaded to group forms are stored in the document library on the Microsoft 365 group's SharePoint site.
- Files that are uploaded to individual forms are stored in the form author's personal OneDrive folder.

When you use the file upload functionality in Forms, you might receive an error message in the following scenarios:

- You [try to add a file upload question](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-questions-that-allow-for-file-uploads-6a75a658-c02b-450e-b119-d068f3cba4cf) to a form.
- You try to upload a file in response to a question.

These errors might occur if file uploads to SharePoint or OneDrive are blocked. This article lists some common error messages and the methods to fix the errors.

## Error: We weren't able to create an upload file folder in OneDrive for Business

This error can occur for the following reasons:

- The **Limited-access user permission lockdown mode** site collection feature is enabled. This feature restricts sharing and access to files and folders.
- The [*People in your organization* sharing links](/microsoft-365/solutions/microsoft-365-limit-sharing?view=o365-worldwide#people-in-your-organization-sharing-links&preserve-view=true) are disabled.
- Sharing files and folders is limited to site owners.

### Resolution

To fix this error for an individual form that you create, sign in to your personal OneDrive for work or school website, and then follow these steps:

1. Disable the **Limited-access user permission lockdown mode** site collection feature if it's enabled.

    1. Select the **Settings** icon in the upper-right corner of the screen.
    1. Select **OneDrive settings** > **More Settings**.
    1. Under **Features and storage**, select **Site collection features**.
    1. Locate **Limited-access user permission lockdown mode**. If its **Status** value is **Active**, select **Deactivate**, and then select **Deactivate this feature** on the confirmation page.
1. Enable the *People in your organization* sharing links if they're disabled.

    **Note**: You must be a SharePoint Online administrator and a site collection administrator to run the following PowerShell commands in [SharePoint Online Management Shell](/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/connect-sharepoint-online).

    To check whether link sharing is disabled in your OneDrive site, run the following PowerShell command:

    ```powershell
    (Get-SPOSite <your OneDrive site URL>).DisableCompanyWideSharingLinks
    ```

    If link sharing is disabled, run the following PowerShell command to enable company-wide link sharing for your OneDrive site:

    ```powershell
    Set-SPOSite -Identity <your OneDrive site URL> -DisableCompanyWideSharingLinks NotDisabled
    ```
