# Generated .PDB file name does not match InfoPath form name

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms
When a form is created in InfoPath Designer 2013 and then saved as an .XSN file, which contains non-ASCII characters in the file name, the generated ".PDB" file does not match the .XSN file name. If you then attempt to debug the form with Visual Studio, Visual Studio is not able to find symbol definitions for the form. One symptom of this problem is that breakpoints set in Visual Studio are not triggered.

## Cause
InfoPath uses URLs to access files, but non-ASCII characters are not directly supported in URL strings. Non-ASCII characters must be encoded or replaced with ASCII characters to convert the .XSN filename to a .PDB filename, and this step causes the ".PDB" file name to differ from the form name as stored in the ".XSN" filename. Consequently, Visual Studio fails to load the ".PDB" file because it expects to find that information in a file with the same name as the ".XSN" file.

## Resolution
We recommend that you avoid using non-ASCII characters in InfoPath form names.
