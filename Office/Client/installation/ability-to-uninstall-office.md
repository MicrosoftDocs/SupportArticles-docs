## More Information

### The requirements to remove Office updates by using the Add or Remove Programs tool

The computer that is running Microsoft Office must meet the following prerequisites to use the Add or Remove Programs tool to remove Office updates: 

- Microsoft Windows Installer version 3.0 or version 3.1 must be installed before you install the removable Office update. 

  **Notes**

  - Microsoft Windows Installer version 3.1 is preferred.

    For more information about how to obtain Windows Installer 3.1 (v2), see [Windows Installer 3.1 v2 (3.1.4000.2435) is available](https://support.microsoft.com/help/893803). 

  - Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2) already includes Microsoft Windows Installer 3.0.3790.2180. Additionally, the 2007 Microsoft Office suites require Windows XP SP2.   
  - Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) already includes Microsoft Windows Installer 3.1.4000.1830.   
  - Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 already includes Microsoft Windows Installer 4.00.6001.0   
   
- The computer must be running Windows Vista, Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 SP1. 

    **Note** When you install either of these service packs, the Add or Remove Programs tool is updated to display Windows Installer updates under the product name.   
- Removing an Office XP update requires the original installation source to be available. Removing an Office 2003 update requires the original installation source to be available if the Local Installation Source feature in Office 2003 Setup is not used.

### How to determine whether an Office update can be removed by using the Add or Remove Programs tool

**Windows XP and Windows Server 2003**

To determine whether an Office update can be removed by using the Add or Remove Programs tool, follow these steps: 

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type appwiz.cpl in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.   
2. In the left column, click **Change or Remove Programs**.   
3. Click to select the **Show Updates** check box.   
4. In the **Currently installed programs and updates** list, click the update that you want to remove.

If the **Remove** button is available, you can remove the Office update.   

**Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008**

To determine whether you can use the Add or Remove Programs tool to remove an Office update, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, type
appwiz.cpl in the **Start Search** box, and then press ENTER.    
2. Under **Tasks**, click **View installed updates**.    
3. Locate and select the update in the list.    
4. If the update can be removed, the
**Uninstall** option will be available in the toolbar.    

### Known issue that may occur when you try to remove Office updates

#### The computer meets the prerequisites, but you cannot remove an update.

This issue may occur if the computer did not meet the prerequisites at the time that the update was installed. The computer must be running Windows Installer version 3.0 or version 3.1 before you install the removable update.

### How to remove an update by using a Windows Installer 

There are some cases in which you do not have the option to remove an update when you use the Add or Remove Programs tool.
 
If this issue occurs, you can remove the update by using Windows Installer 3.1. The Windows Installer 3.1 redistributable system component will install on the following operating systems: 

- Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 (SP3) and Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 (SP4)    
- Windows XP original release version, Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1), and Windows XP SP2   
- Windows Server 2003 original release version

  **Note** Windows Server 2003 SP1 already includes Windows Installer 3.1.   

For more information about how to obtain Windows Installer 3.1 (v2), see[Windows Installer 3.1 v2 (3.1.4000.2435) is available](https://support.microsoft.com/help/893803). 

#### Command syntax

With Windows Installer 3.1, you can remove an update by typing a command in the **Run** dialog box. For example, to remove an update, click **Start**, click **Run**, type the following command in the **Open** box, and then click
 **OK**:
 
msiexec /package {**product_code**} /uninstall "**full_path_to_.msp_file**" /qb

**Notes**

- When you try to remove an Office update, you may be prompted for your Office source CD-ROM.   
- The following explains the placeholders for this command: 

   - The **product_code** placeholder represents the product code GUID that is associated with the Office product that you installed an update for.
   - The **full_path_to_.msp_file** placeholder represents the full path of the update package (.msp file).   
   
- The following explains the parameters for this command:

   The /qb switch. If you use the /qb switch, you are prompted if an update is not removable. If you use the /passive switch, you are not prompted if an update is not removable. If you use the /qb switch and if an update is not removable, you receive the following message:Uninstallation of the patch package is not supported.   

For example, to remove an update where the product code is "{0C9840E7-7F0B-C648-10F0-4641926FE463}", and the path of the .msp file is "C:\Update\file name.msp", you would type the following in the **Run** dialog box:

msiexec /package {0C9840E7-7F0B-C648-10F0-4641926FE463} /uninstall "c:\update\file name.msp" /qb

To obtain the full path of the .msp file, follow these steps: 
1. Locate the .exe file that you used to install the Office update. If you do not have the file saved to the hard disk drive, download and then save the Office update to a folder on the computer.   
2.  Use a file extraction utility, such as WinZip, to extract the files from the .exe update file. 

    One of the files that is extracted should be a .msp file. This is the file that you must point to when you run the command to remove the Office update.   

**Note** Instead of the full path of the .msp file, you can also specify the patch GUID. For example, to remove an update where the product code is "{0C9840E7-7F0B-C648-10F0-4641926FE463}", and the patch GUID is "{EB8C947C-78B2-85A0-644D-86CEEF8E07C0}", you would type the following in the
 **Run** dialog box:
 
msiexec /package {0C9840E7-7F0B-C648-10F0-4641926FE463} /uninstall {EB8C947C-78B2-85A0-644D-86CEEF8E07C0} /qb
