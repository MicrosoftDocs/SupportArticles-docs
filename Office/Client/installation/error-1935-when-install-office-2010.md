# Error 1935 when you try to install Microsoft Office

If you see "Error 1935. An error occurred during the installation of assembly component" when you install Office 2010 or 2007 or one of the Office stand-alone products like Excel, restart the computer and try to run setup again as a quick first step.

If the error still appears after restarting the computer, try these other methods to fix the problem.

## Delete the APPMODEL registry subkey

Deleting the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\APPMODEL` subkey should allow you to install Office.

> [!WARNING]
> Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. These problems could cause you to have to reinstall the operating system or even prevent your computer from starting. Microsoft can't guarantee that these problems can be solved. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows-855140ad-e318-2a13-2829-d428a2ab0692) in case problems occur. Modify the registry at your own risk.

1. Select Start, type *`regedit`* and press Enter, then select Registry Editor from the search results.
1. Navigate to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\APPMODEL` subkey.
1. Right-click the subkey, and then select **Delete**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm the deletion.

Restart the device and then try installing Office again. If you still get the error, try the next method.

## Run the System Update Readiness tool

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The System Update Readiness tool can only be used on Windows 7 or Windows Vista operating systems. If you're using a different version of Windows, try one of the other methods in this article.

Select and download the System Update Readiness tool for your version of Windows:

## More Information

If error 1935 happens when you install Office 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1), follow the steps in [Description of Office 2010 update: September 13, 2011](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2553092).

You may experience error 1935 when you install Office 2010 Service Pack 2 (SP2). As Office 2010 includes .NET Programmability Support, this issue may be caused by the interference between Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) and Windows Search (SearchIndexer.exe) or another module in the assembly file copy process. This issue may also occur when you apply other updates, for example, a hotfix for Microsoft .NET Framework components. To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Method 1: Retry installation of Office 2010 SP2
- Method 2: Stop Windows Search Service, and apply Office 2010 SP2

  To stop Windows Search Service, follow these steps:

     1. Click **Start**, type `services.msc` in the Search programs and files text box, and then click services.msc in the search results.

     1. In the list of services, right-click **Windows Search**, and then click **Stop**.

- Method 3: Perform a clean startup, and apply Office 2010 SP2
- Method 4: Install all available updates by using Microsoft Update and apply Office 2010 SP2
