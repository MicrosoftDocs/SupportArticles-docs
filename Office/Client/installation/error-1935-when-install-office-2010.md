- Method 2: Stop Windows Search Service, and apply Office 2010 SP2

  To stop Windows Search Service, follow these steps:

     1. Click Start, type services.msc in the Search programs and filestext box, and then click services.msc in the search results.

     1. In the list of services, right-click Windows Search, and then click Stop.   
   
- Method 3: Perform a clean startup, and apply Office 2010 SP2   
- Method 4: Install all available updates by using Microsoft Update and apply Office 2010 SP2
