# Error code 30010-45 or 30088-26 when installing Microsoft 365 Apps

## Symptoms

If you try to install Microsoft 365 Apps while you're using FSLogix to manage profiles, you receive one of the following error messages:

> Something went wrong<br>
> Sorry, we ran into a problem.<br>
> Error Code: 30010-45

> Something went wrong<br>
> We're sorry, we ran into a problem while updating Office. Please try again after restarting your computer. If you continue to experience problems, repair Office from 'Programs and Features' in the Control Panel.<br>
> Error Code: 30088-26

When you select **Close** in the "30010-45" error message window, you also receive the following error message:

> Couldn't install<br>
> We're sorry, we had a problem installing your Office program(s).<br>
> Is your internet connection working? Do you have enough free space on your main hard drive?<br>
> Please try installing again after you've checked the above.<br>
> Error Code: 0-2031 (17004)

## Cause

FSLogix is set to hide Officeclicktorun.exe or another Office executable.

## Resolution

1. Select **Start**, and then enter *cmd*. Right-click **Command Prompt** in the search results, and then select **Run as administrator**. 

1. At the command prompt, enter `â€œC:\Program Files\FSLogix\Apps\frx.exe" list-rules`, and then press **Enter**:

1. In the list, check for rules that hide Office executables. For example:

    ```powershell
    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneNote.lnk -> [Hide]
    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\PowerPoint.lnk -> [Hide]
    C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Outlook.lnk -> [Hide]
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\ONENOTE.EXE -> [Hide]
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\POWERPNT.EXE -> [Hide]
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE -> [Hide]
    ```

1. Remove any rules that hide Office executables. For more instructions, see [How to manage Rule Sets and Rules in Application Masking](/fslogix/application-masking-rules-ht).

1. [Uninstall Office automatically](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/uninstall-office-automatically-9ad57b43-fa12-859a-9cf0-b694637b3b05).

1. Restart the device, and then try again to install Microsoft 365 Apps.
