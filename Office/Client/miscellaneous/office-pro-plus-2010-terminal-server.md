# How to enable Office Professional Plus 2010 to run on a terminal server

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

This article describes how Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) and Microsoft TechNet subscription customers can enable Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 to run on a server on which Office 2010 was installed and activated and on which the Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services) server role was later added.

## Introduction 

Consider the following scenario:

- You install Office Professional Plus 2010 by using an MSDN or TechNet subscription.   
- You successfully activate Office Professional Plus 2010.   
- You want to use Windows Server 2008 Terminal Services to let users use Office Professional Plus 2010 applications from their workstations.   

In this scenario, you must install an additional product key for Office Professional Plus 2010. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the Terminal Services (Remote Desktop Services) role is already enabled on the server, OEM keys are not valid, and you must use the special Terminal Services product key to install Office 2010 on the server as retail.
