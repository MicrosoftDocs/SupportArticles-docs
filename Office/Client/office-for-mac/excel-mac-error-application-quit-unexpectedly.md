## Symptoms

When you start Microsoft Excel for Mac or try to open a new Excel workbook, you experience one of the following issues:

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods, depending on your version of Office for Mac.

### Excel 2016 for Mac

#### Step 1: Quit all programs and close all windows

1. On the **Apple** menu, select **Force Quit**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You cannot quit **Finder**.

4. Repeat steps A through C for all the applications that are causing issues until you exit all active applications.

#### Step 2: Remove Excel preferences and Office settings

1. Make sure that all Microsoft Office for Mac programs are closed.
2. On the **Go** menu, open the root/hidden *Library* folder.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The *Library* folder is hidden in Mac OSX Yosemite. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you select the **Go** menu.
3. Open the *Group Containers* folder.
4. Look for a folder whose name ends ".Office", and open it.
5. In this folder, look for the *Com.microsoft.officeprefs.plist* file.
6. Delete this file by dragging it to the trash. This will delete the Office preferences that you set during the initial start of the application.
7. Restart the application, and check whether the issue is resolved. If the issue is not resolved, delete the whole folder that you found in step D. This will delete all previous settings and preferences that were set across all applications.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This will reset Office back to the first-run phase of initial set up. It will also re-create a folder in the *~/Library/Group Containers* location.

#### Step 3: Perform a clean restart
