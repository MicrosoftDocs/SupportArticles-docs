# "Office 365 Enterprise E3 setup is incomplete" error in Microsoft 365 for Mac

## Symptoms

If Microsoft Office for Mac is installed by some method other than directly from the Microsoft 365 portal, you receive the following error message even though Office is installed successfully: 

"Office 365 Enterprise E3 setup is incomplete."

## Cause

This behavior is by design. The message can be safely ignored.

## Resolution

To prevent this message from appearing, remove Office, and then reinstall it from the Microsoft 365 portal.
