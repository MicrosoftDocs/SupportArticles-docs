# "wkresources" files in Trash after using or starting Office for Mac applications

## Summary

The file "wkresources" gets created and moved to Trash-Recovered Files every time you open Office for Mac 2011 document or application.

## More Information

Click Help then type *recovered files* to review the information why recovered files are created. From macOS Help Topic:

If the Trash contains folders of recovered files

*One or more Recovered files folders may appear in Trash after restarting your computer.*

*The recovered files are temporary files used by macOS X applications. Temporary files are deleted by an application when it no longer needs them. If an application quits unexpectedly, the temporary files may not be deleted by the application. When you restart your computer, macOS X moves these temporary files to the Trash.*

*You can retrieve usefully files by dragging them out of the Trash. In most cases, however, the temporary files are not important and it is safe to empty your Trash.*
