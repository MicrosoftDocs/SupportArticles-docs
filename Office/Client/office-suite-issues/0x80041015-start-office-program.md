## Symptoms

When you try to start a Microsoft Office 2013 or Microsoft Office 365 program, you receive the following error message:

- An Office product was activated before the May Public Update was installed.   
- There was an attempt to add another Office product (such as Microsoft Visio, OneDrive for Business, or Office 365) or to reinstall an Office product on the same computer after the May Public Update was installed.
