# You receive a "0x80041015" error message when you try to start an Office program

## Symptoms

When you try to start a Microsoft 365 program, you receive the following error message:

```output
Sorry, we ran into a problem While trying to install the product key.

If this keeps happening, you should try repairing your office product.

System error: 0x80041015
```

## Cause

This problem can occur when all the following conditions are true:

- An Office product was activated before the May Public Update was installed.
- There was an attempt to add another Office product (such as Microsoft Visio, OneDrive for Business, or Microsoft 365) or to reinstall an Office product on the same computer after the May Public Update was installed.

## Resolution

### Click-to-Run information

An updated Office 2013 Click-to-Run image has been published that also resolves this problem. To obtain the image and for more information, see the following Microsoft Office Sustained Engineering Team blog article:
