# Support Engineers can't guarantee complete repair of all corrupted Office files

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2620482

## Summary

In certain situations, you may need a Microsoft Support Engineer's assistance to repair or recover a corrupted Microsoft Office file. However, not all corrupted Office files can be completely recovered/repaired.

When you repair a corrupted Office file, whether it be an Access database, Excel workbook, PowerPoint slide deck, Word document, Outlook personal (.PST) file or any other file that's created using Microsoft Office, Microsoft Support Engineers will assist you with troubleshooting and recovering the file. However, Microsoft can't guarantee that any corrupted Office file can be recovered or that any data contained within the file can be recovered during this process.

## More information

Because a Support Engineer will be working with your Office file to attempt recovery of the document, support of this nature is considered to be at an Advisory Services level.
