# Error message when selecting hyperlink in Office: "Cannot locate the Internet server or proxy server"

## Symptoms

When you create a hyperlink in an Office document and then select the link, you may receive one of these error messages:

**Unable to open \<URL>. Cannot locate the Internet server or proxy server.** 

**Unable to open \<URL>. Cannot open the specified file.**

**\<URL> = the hyperlink you inserted.**

> [!NOTE]
> The hyperlink does work if you type it directly in the browser, or in the Open box of the Run dialog box (select **Start**, and then select **Run**).

## Cause

This problem occurs when the following conditions are true:

- You are using Microsoft Internet Explorer:

  - As a proxy server -or-
  - With a firewall that doesn't allow HTTP requests to be placed on your local network

- Internet Explorer isn't your default browser.

- The **ForceShellExecute** registry key isn't present in the following location, or isn't set to **1**:

    - For 32-bit versions of office installed on 64-bit operating systems:
    
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet`
    
    - For 32-bit versions of Office installed on 32-bit operating systems, or 64-bit versions of Office installed on 64-bit operating systems:
    
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet` 
      
    > [!NOTE]
    > The registry path doesn't depend on your Office version.
         
## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, select the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[322756](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

### Add the Internet Subkey to the registry and set the Value data

To work around this issue, either add the ForceShellExecute subkey, if it is not present, and set the Value data, or if it is present, set the Value data of the ForceShellExecute subkey.

1. Quit any programs that are running.   
2. Select **Start**, and then select **Run**. Type **regedit** in the **Open** box, and then select **OK**.   
3. In Registry Editor, browse to one of the following subkeys (create the keys if they do not exist):

    - For a 32-bit version of Office on a 64-bit version of Windows:
    
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet`
    
    - For a 32-bit version of Office on a 32-bit version of Windows:
    
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet`
    
    - For a 64-bit version of Office on a 64-bit version of Windows:
    
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\Internet`      
    
4. Make sure the Internet subkey is selected. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **DWORD** Value. Add the following registry value:

    **Value Name: ForceShellExecute**

5. Double-click **ForceShellExecute**, and then set the Value data to **1**. Select **OK**.   
6. On the Registry menu, select Exit.

## More Information

A hyperlink may not go to a Microsoft Word document or a Microsoft Excel worksheet after you use this workaround. 

Office uses the Urlmon.dll file to handle all Internet transitions.

In this case, the Urlmon.dll file sends a request to get a file via `http://` through the proxy server. The proxy server sees that the request came from Internet Explorer, based upon the HTTP User Agent field of the `http://request`. It then gives an error 403, basically saying "Access Denied." 

The Urlmon.dll file gets this and simply returns the error message mentioned earlier. The error means that the request failed, but it never states why it failed.

The workaround is to use a ShellExecute() on the URL. This allows the operating system to start the URL on the default browser. If the default browser isn't restricted by the proxy server, the proper page is displayed.
