## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

To work around this issue, you must change the registry to indicate the number of places to list in Recent Places.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Exit all Office programs.   
2. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit, and then click **OK**.   
3. Locate and then click to select one of the following registry subkeys:     

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Place MRU**

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Excel\Place MRU**

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Place MRU**

4. After you select the subkey that is specified in step 3, right-click **Max Display**, and then click **Modify**.   
5. Click **Decimal**, and in the **Value data** box, type a number to represent the number of places that you want to list in Recent Places, and then click **OK**.

    Note By default, **Max Display** is set to 25.
