# Errors when Office add-ins start

## Symptoms
When Microsoft Office tries to start an Office add-in that uses a task pane, an error occurs, and the add-in doesn't start. In this situation, Office displays an error message in an information bar at the top of the task pane, as shown in the following screenshot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This kind of error is generated by Office, not by the add-in. Unless the error message explicitly states otherwise, users should *not* contact the add-in provider. They should contact their Microsoft 365 administrator, instead.

The following table lists the most common error messages that cause users to mistakenly contact the add-in provider.

| Error text  |  Explanation |
|---|---|
|This Add-in uses features not supported by its add-in catalog.|For more information about this error, see [Deploy and publish Office Add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/publish/publish#additional-publication-methods-for-the-add-in-only-manifest).|
