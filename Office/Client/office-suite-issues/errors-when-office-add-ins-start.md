# Errors when Office add-ins start

## Summary

This article provides information about errors that you might see when an Office add-in starts.

## Errors generated by Office

When Microsoft Office tries to start an Office add-in that uses a task pane, an error occurs, and the add-in doesn't start. In this situation, Office displays an error message in an information bar at the top of the task pane, as shown in the following screenshot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This kind of error is generated by Office, not by the add-in. Unless the error message explicitly states otherwise, you shouldn't contact the add-in provider. Contact your Microsoft 365 administrator instead.

The following table lists the most common error messages that cause users to mistakenly contact the add-in provider.
