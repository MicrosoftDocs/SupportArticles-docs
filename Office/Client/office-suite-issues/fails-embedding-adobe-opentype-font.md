# You cannot embed an Adobe OpenType font in a document in an Office program

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to embed fonts in a Microsoft Office document, Adobe OpenType fonts that have the ".otf" extension are not embedded.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the programs that are listed in the "Applies to" section do not embed fonts that have the ".otf" extension. The programs that are listed in the "Applies to" section only embed fonts that have the ".ttf" extension.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use only fonts that have the ".ttf" extension in documents in which you intend to embed the fonts.

## More Information

The Adobe OpenType format is an extension of the TrueType SFNT format that supports Adobe PostScript font data and new typographic features. Adobe OpenType fonts that contain PostScript data have an ".otf" extension. However, TrueType-based OpenType fonts have a ".ttf" extension.
