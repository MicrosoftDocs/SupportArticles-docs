## Symptoms

You use the Office Customization Tool to customize an installation of the 2007 Microsoft Office system. You try to open the Office Customization Tool by typing the following command at a command prompt:

When you do this, you may receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
Files necessary to run the Office Customization Tool were not found. Run Setup from the installation point of a qualifying product.
```

## Cause

This issue may occur if you do not have a volume-license version of the 2007 Office system. The Office Customization Tool is available only with volume-license versions of the 2007 Office system. This tool requires an Admin folder in the 2007 Office system source image. If the Admin folder does not exist, you will receive this error message.
