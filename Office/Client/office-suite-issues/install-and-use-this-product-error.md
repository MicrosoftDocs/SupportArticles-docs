When you try to install Microsoft Office 2010, the installation does not finish, and you receive the following error message:

    To install and use this product, you must be running one of the following operating systems:

##  Cause

This issue occurs when one of the following conditions is true:

- The operating system on which you are trying to install Office 2010 does not meet the system requirements for the product. For example, you are trying to install Office 2010 on a Windows XP-based computer that does not have Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed.   
- The Office 2010 Setup program (Setup.exe) is configured to run in compatibility mode. That is, the Setup program is set to run under a particular operating system, such as Microsoft Windows 95.   


##  Resolution

Follow the two methods provided to resolve your problem:

|Windows Server 2008|Windows Server 2008|32-bit or 64-bit |
