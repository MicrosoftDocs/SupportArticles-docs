# "Could not create the work file” error in Office

## Symptoms

When you try to preview or save a document, Word returns the following error message:

> Word could not create the work file. Check the temp environment variable.

## Resolution

### Scan for malware and disk errors

1. Run an antivirus scan. If your antivirus program doesn’t detect any malware, check for corrupted files or disk errors.

1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, select **Start**, enter *cmd*, and then press Enter.

1. In the search results, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then select **Run as administrator**.

1. Enter *sfc.exe /scannow*, and press Enter.

1. After the check is done and any errors are repaired, enter *chkdsk /r /f*, and then press Enter.

1. Restart your device, and try the action in Word again. If the error still occurs, try the next method.

### Add an Environment Variable

1. Select **Start** > **Settings** > **System** > **About**.

1. Scroll down to **Related settings**, and then select **Advanced system settings**.

1. Select **Environment Variables**.

1. Under **User variables for \<username>** (where **\<username>** is your user name), select the **New** button.

1. In the **Variable name** field, enter **%userprofile%**.
 
1. In the **Variable value** field, enter **C:\Users\\<username\>** (where **\<username\>** is the same value as **\<username>** in step 4).

1. Select **OK**, and then select **OK** on any confirmation window that opens.

1. Restart your device, and try the action in Word again. If the error still occurs, try the next method.

### Create a Temporary Internet Files folder

1. Start Windows Explorer.

1. Navigate to the following folder:

   C:\Users\\<username\>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache

   Note: In this path, **\<username>** represents your user profile name.

1. Create a folder, and name it *Content.Word*.

   Note: It might be necessary to turn on **Hidden Items** on the View ribbon of Windows Explorer.
