# Office applications crash when you open an IRM document if HTTPS proxy is enabled

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

You do one of the following: 
 
- Start an Office 2016 or Office 2013 application    
- Open an information rights management (IRM)–protected document or email message    
- Try to protect a document or email message by using IRM    
- Sign in to an Office 2016 or Office 2013 application    
 
In this situation, the relevant Office application crashes. 

## Cause

Windows verifies that the data sent by the Azure RMS service is valid and is coming from RMS. If Windows is configured to use a proxy server for HTTPS connections, this validation process may fail and cause Office applications to crash. 

## Resolution

This issue is fixed in the following updates: 
 
- Office 2013 MSI: [April 4, 2017, update for Office 2013 (KB 3172523)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3172523)    
- Office 2016 MSI: [April 4, 2017, update for Office 2016 (KB 3178666)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3178666)    
- Office 2013 Click-to-Run: Build 15.0. 4919.1002 or a later build    
- Office 2016 Click-to-Run: Build 16.0.8067.2115 or a later build

 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, temporarily disable Azure RMS server certification validation by configuring a registry key as follows.

**Important** Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.   

Notes   

- Setting this registry key disables the additional security validation that makes sure that the Azure RMS server's certificate is chained to the [Microsoft Trusted Root Certificate](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc751157.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396).    
- Setting this registry key does not affect the primary security validation (whether the Azure RMS server's certificate is valid, expired, and chained to a trusted root).    
     

 
1. Exit all Office applications.    
2. Start Registry Editor:

   - In Windows 10, go to **Start**, enter **regedit **in the **Search **box, and then select **regedit.exe** in the search results.    
   - In Windows 7, click **Start**, enter **regedit** in the **Search programs and files** box, and then click **regedit.exe** in the search results.    
   - In Windows 8 or Windows 8.1, move the mouse pointer to the upper-right corner, select **Search**, type **regedit **in the search box, and then select **regedit.exe** in the search results.    
     
3. Locate and then select one of the following subkeys, depending on your version of Office and Windows:
   - 32-bit Office
     - 32-bit Windows
       
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIPC\RMSOServerVerification    
     - 64-bit Windows
       
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\MSIPC\RMSOServerVerification 
        
   - 64-bit Office

     - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIPC\RMSOServerVerification          
4. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **DWORD Value**.    
5. Enter **NoValidation**, and then press Enter.    
6. In the **Details** pane, press and hold (or right-click) **NoValidation**, and then select **Modify**.    
7. In the **Value data** box, enter **1**, and then select **OK**.    
8. Exit Registry Editor.
