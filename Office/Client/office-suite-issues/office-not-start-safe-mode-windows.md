# Office applications don't start when Windows is running in safe mode

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3140179

## Symptoms

When you try to open an Office 2016 or Office 2013 application, such as Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or Access, one of the following errors may be displayed, depending on the installation type of Office.

- Click-to-Run installation type:

    > Something went wrong
    > We couldn't start your program. Please try starting it again.
    > If it won't start, try repairing Office from 'Programs and Features' in the Control Panel.

- MSI-based installation type:

  > Microsoft Office can't find your license for this application. A repair attempt was unsuccessful or was cancelled. Microsoft Office will now exit.

## Cause

This issue occurs when you try to start an Office 2016 or Office 2013 application while Microsoft Windows is running in safe mode.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, start Windows by using the **Selective Startup** option in **System Configuration** instead of safe mode. The steps to configure **Selective Startup** vary, depending on your Office installation type.

- Click-to-Run installation type:

    1. Open **System Configuration**. To do this, press the Windows Key + R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type *msconfig*, and then click **OK**.
    2. Select **Selective startup**, and then clear the **Load system services** and **Load startup items** check boxes.

    3. Click the **Services** tab.
    4. Select the **Microsoft Office ClickToRun Service** check box.

    5. Click **OK**.
    6. If you're prompted, click **Restart**.

- MSI-based installation type:

    1. Open **System Configuration**. To do this, press the Windows Key + R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type *msconfig*, and then click **OK**.
    2. Select **Selective startup**, and then clear the **Load system services** and **Load startup items** check boxes.

    3. Click **OK**.
    4. If you're prompted, click **Restart**.

When you have finished troubleshooting and no longer need to run in **Selective startup**, return to **Normal startup** by following these steps:

1. Open **System Configuration**. To do this, press the Windows Key + R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type *msconfig*, and then click **OK**.
2. Select **Normal startup**.
3. Click **OK**.
4. If you're prompted, click **Restart**.

## More information

To determine whether your Office installation is Click-to-Run or MSI-based, follow these steps:

1. Start an Office application, such as Outlook or Word.
2. On the **File** menu, select **Account** or **Office Account**.
3. For Office Click-to-Run installations, an **Update Options** item is displayed. For MSI-based installations, the **Update Options** item isn't displayed.
