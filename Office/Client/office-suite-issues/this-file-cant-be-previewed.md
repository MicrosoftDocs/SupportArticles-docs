# "This file can't be previewed" error in Word, Excel, or PowerPoint

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to preview a document in the Preview pane, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

"This file can't be previewed because of an error in Microsoft **Word** previewer."

To work around this issue, preview the document in Windows Explorer or in a different Microsoft Office program. For example, preview a Microsoft Word document in Microsoft Excel or Microsoft PowerPoint. 

For more information about this issue, consider the following scenario: 

- You start one of the programs that are listed in the "Applies To Products" section.    
- You click the **Microsoft Office Button** or the File tab, and then you then click Open.    
- In the Open dialog box, you click Show the preview pane.    
- You select a document to preview.    

In this scenario, a preview of the document is not displayed. Additionally, you receive an error message in the **Preview** pane that resembles the following:

"This file can't be previewed because of an error in the Microsoft **Word** previewer."

This issue occurs because you must open another instance of the program to preview the document.
