# Office 2010 Help Files: Win32API_PtrSafe with 64-bit Support

## Summary

The file Win32_PtrSafe.txt contains Windows API Declarations and Constants for Visual Basic (Updated for the 64-bit version of Microsoft Office 2010) provides declarations for Microsoft Visual Basic programmers who want to call Windows API routines. This file updates and replaces Win32API.txt to include calls to the 64-bit version of Microsoft Office 2010.

## More Information

Versions of Microsoft&reg; Office and Microsoft Visual Basic&reg; for Applications (VBA) prior to Microsoft Office 2010 and Visual Basic for Applications 7.0 (VBA 7) included the file, Win32API.txt, which facilitated making calls to the Microsoft Windows API. With the addition of 64-bit support in Microsoft Office 2010, an update to this file is needed to support 64-bit API calls. Win32API_PtrSafe.txt is a new version of Win32API.txt that supports API calls on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.

Win32API_PtrSafe.txt contains the following: 

·         32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) compatible Declare statements for the Windows API functions that were included in the original Win32API.txt file. 

·         Global constant declarations for the constants that the provided Declare statements use. 

·         Type declarations for the user-defined types (structures) that the provided Declare statements use.
