# "No default mail client" error when sending files from Office programs

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you attempt to send a file from Microsoft Excel, Microsoft  Word, or Microsoft PowerPoint using email, you receive the following error:

```adoc
Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default  mail client. 
```

## Cause

This problem occurs when the following registry data is present on your computer:

- 32-bit versions of Microsoft Office on 32-bit versions of Windows, or 64-bit versions of Microsoft Office on 64-bit versions of Windows

    Key: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\MSMapiApps**
    
    REG_SZ: **Version**
    
    Data value: <no data>

- 32-bit versions of Microsoft Office on 64-bit versions of Windows

    Key: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\MSMapiApps**
    
    REG_SZ: **Version**
    
    Data value: <no data>   

**NOTE**: If you do not find the **Version** value with no data associated with it, or the **Version** value does not exist at all under this registry path, then there is a different cause of the error. Please search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for additional causes of this error.
