# How to locate your OneNote notebooks

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

After you start OneNote, you do not see the notebooks that you expect to see. 

##  Cause

This issue occurs if you are not logged in with the correct Microsoft account or work or school account. 

##  Resolution

### Step 1: Locate your notebooks by using OneNote Online

1. Go to [https://www.onenote.com](https://www.onenote.com/).   
2. Click the Sign In button at the top-right corner of the screen. If you don't see the Sign In button, click the Sign out link, and you will be directed to Sign In.

3. Click Sign In, and then select an account type.

   ![account type](./media/locate-onenote-notebooks/account-type.jpg)

4. A work or school account takes you to your company or school Office 365 sign-in page. A Microsoft account takes you to an MSA sign-in page.

    ![sign in page](./media/locate-onenote-notebooks/sign-in-page.jpg)

You should now see your notebooks on OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, depending on which account you signed in with. Note which account you used to access your notebooks so that you can make sure you're signed in with the correct account in OneNote on your other devices.

   I can't get signed into my Microsoft account – what next?

   Try signing in to your Microsoft account directly by going to [https://account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) and then selecting Sign in. If you cannot sign in, this means you're using the incorrect email or password for your Microsoft account, or that you don't have a Microsoft account.   

### Step 2: Connect OneNote to the correct account

Now that you know which account contains your notebooks, sign out of the accounts in OneNote, and sign back in with the correct account.

#### Win32 OneNote:

1. Start OneNote 2016 for Windows. If you haven't signed into a Microsoft account or to a work or school account, you will be prompted to sign in when you start OneNote. Use the account that you used in step 1 at the top of the "Resolution" section.

   If you do not see your notebooks, go on to step 2.

2. On the File menu in OneNote, click Account, and then click Remove next to any Connected Services.
