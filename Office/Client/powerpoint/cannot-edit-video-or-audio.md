# You cannot edit video or audio in PowerPoint if Desktop Experience is not installed

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When PowerPoint is installed on a Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2008 machine, certain media editing options may be unavailable. For example, the Insert Video and Insert Audio options are greyed out.

## Cause

The necessary Windows components to enable these features are not installed by default in a server operating system.

## Resolution

To enable these features, you must install the Desktop Experience feature for the server. To install Desktop Experience, follow these steps: 

1. Start Server Manager.   
2. In the details pane, locate the Features Summary area, and then click Add Features.    
3. In the Add Features Wizard, click to select the Desktop Experience check box, and then click Next.    
4. Click Install.   
5. After the Desktop Experience feature is installed, click Close to exit the Add Features Wizard, and then click Yes to restart the computer.
