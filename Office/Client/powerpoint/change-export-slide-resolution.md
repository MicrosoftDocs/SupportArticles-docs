# How to change the export resolution of a PowerPoint slide

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

You can change the export resolution in Microsoft PowerPoint by saving a slide in a picture format. There are two steps to this process: using the system registry to change the default resolution setting for exported slides, and then actually saving the slide as a picture at the new resolution.

## Step 1: Change the export resolution setting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

By default, the export resolution of a PowerPoint slide that you want to save as a picture is 96 dots per inch (dpi). To change the export resolution, follow these steps:

1. Exit all Windows-based programs.   
2. Right-click the **Start** button and then **Run**. (In Windows 7, select **Start**, and then **Run**.)  
3. In the **Open** box, type regedit, and then select **OK**.   
4. Locate one of the following registry subkeys, depending on the version of PowerPoint that you're using:

    PowerPoint 2016

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2013

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2010

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2007

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2003

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Options**


5. Click the **Options** subkey, point to **New** on the **Edit** menu, and then click **DWORD Value**.   
6. Type ExportBitmapResolution, and then press Enter.
7. Make sure that **ExportBitmapResolution** is selected, and then click **Modify** on the **Edit** menu.   
8. In the Edit DWORD Value dialog box, select **Decimal**.   
9. In the **Value data** box, type the value of the resolution that you want such as 300. Or, use the parameters in the following table.

    |Decimal value|Full-screen pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Widescreen pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Dots per inch (horizontal and vertical)|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |50|500 × 375|667 × 375|50 dpi|
    |96 (default)|960 × 720|1280 × 720|96 dpi|
    |100|1000 × 750|1333 × 750|100 dpi|
    |150|1500 × 1125|2000 × 1125|150 dpi|
    |200|2000 × 1500|2667 × 1500|200 dpi|
    |250|2500 × 1875|3333 × 1875|250 dpi|
    |300|3000 × 2250|4000 × 2250|300 dpi|

    > [!NOTE]
    > See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for more information when you set this value.

10. Select **OK**.   
11. On the **File** menu, select **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.   

## Step 2: Export the slide as a picture

1. In PowerPoint, open your slide presentation, and then open the slide that you want to export.   
2. On the **File** menu, select **Save As**.   
3. In the **Save as type** box, select one of the following picture formats:

   - GIF Graphics Interchange Format (.gif)   
   - JPEG File Interchange Format (*.jpg)   
   - PNG Portable Network Graphics Format (*.png)   
   - TIFF Tag Image File Format (*.tif)   
   - Device Independent Bitmap (*.bmp)   
   - Windows Metafile (*.wmf)   
   - Enhanced Windows Metafile (*.emf)   

> [!NOTE]
> You may want to change the picture's save location in the **Save in** box. You may also want to change the name of the picture in the **File name** box.   

4. Select **Save**. You will be prompted with the following dialog box:

    ![Select Current Slide Only.](https://support.microsoft.com/Library/Images/2881255.jpg)


    Select **Current Slide Only**. The slide is saved in the new format and resolution, in the location that you specified in the **Save in** box.   
5. To verify that the slide is saved in the resolution that you specified, right-click the picture, and then select **Properties**.   

## Limitations

When you set the ExportBitmapResolution registry value in PowerPoint, there's a maximum DPI limitation to consider for some versions of PowerPoint.

Maximum DPI is dependent upon the slide size. The formula is:
maxdpi = (sqrt(100,000,000 / (slide with * slide height)), where slide width/height are in inches.

For example, for a standard 13.3" x 7.5" slide, the equation would be:
sqrt(100,000,000 / (13.333 * 7.5) ) = 1000.

**PowerPoint 2019, 2016, 2013, and 365**

There is no fixed DPI limit. Slide export is only limited by how big the resulting bitmap gets. PowerPoint can support creating bitmaps up to ~100,000,000 pixels (width x height). For standard widescreen slides (13.3" x 7.5") this means a maximum DPI of 1000. For the old style 10" x 7.5" slides this means a maximum of 1155 DPI, but depending on slide size, this can be more or less.

**PowerPoint 2010 and older**

The maximum resolution that PowerPoint can export is 3072 pixels, based on the longest edge of the slide. For example, the standard 10" × 7.5" slide has a maximum effective DPI value of 307. The 3070-pixel result (10 × 307 = 3070) falls within the 3072 limit. However, any DPI setting that's greater than 307 for a standard slide reverts to the limit of 3072.

|Decimal value|Pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Dots per inch (horizontal and vertical)|
|---|---|---|
|307|3072 × 2304|307 dpi|

The 3072-pixel limit also applies to saving the slide programmatically.

For example, the following code programmatically saves a picture with dimensions of 3072 × 2304 pixels:

```powershell
ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1).export
"c:\<filename>.jpg","JPG",4000,3000
```
