# How to export high-resolution (high-dpi) slides from PowerPoint

You can change the export resolution in Microsoft PowerPoint by saving a slide in a picture format. There are two steps to this process: Use the system registry to change the default resolution setting for exported slides, and then save the slide as a picture at the new resolution.

## Step 1: Change the export resolution setting

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

By default, the export resolution of a PowerPoint slide that you want to save as a picture is 96 dots per inch (dpi). To change the export resolution, follow these steps:

1. Exit all Windows-based programs.
2. Right-click **Start**, and then select **Run**. (In Windows 7, select **Start**, and then select **Run**.)
3. In the **Open** box, type **regedit**, and then select **OK**.
4. Locate one of the following registry subkeys, depending on the version of PowerPoint that you're using:

   PowerPoint 2016, 2019, PowerPoint for Microsoft 365

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2013

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2010

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2007

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\PowerPoint\Options**

   PowerPoint 2003

   **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Options**

5. Select the **Options** subkey, point to **New** on the **Edit** menu, and then select **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
6. Enter **ExportBitmapResolution**, and then press Enter.
7. Make sure that **ExportBitmapResolution** is selected, and then select **Modify** on the **Edit** menu.
8. In the **Edit DWORD Value** dialog box, select **Decimal**.
9. In the **Value data** box, specify a resolution of **300**. Or, use the parameters from the following table.

    |Decimal value|Full-screen pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Widescreen pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Dots per inch (horizontal and vertical)|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |50|500 × 375|667 × 375|50 dpi|
    |96 (default)|960 × 720|1280 × 720|96 dpi|
    |100|1000 × 750|1333 × 750|100 dpi|
    |150|1500 × 1125|2000 × 1125|150 dpi|
    |200|2000 × 1500|2667 × 1500|200 dpi|
    |250|2500 × 1875|3333 × 1875|250 dpi|
    |300|3000 × 2250|4000 × 2250|300 dpi|

    > [!NOTE]
    > See the [Limitations](#limitations) section for more information when you set this value.

10. Select **OK**.
11. On the **File** menu, select **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.

## Step 2: Export the slide as a picture

1. In PowerPoint, open your slide presentation, and then open the slide that you want to export.
2. On the **File** menu, select **Save As**.
3. In the **Save as type** box, select one of the following picture formats:

   - GIF Graphics Interchange Format (.gif)
   - JPEG File Interchange Format (*.jpg)
   - PNG Portable Network Graphics Format (*.png)
   - TIFF Tag Image File Format (*.tif)
   - Device Independent Bitmap (*.bmp)
   - Windows Metafile (*.wmf)
   - Enhanced Windows Metafile (*.emf)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may want to change the picture's save location in the **Save in** box. You may also want to change the name of the picture in the **File name** box.

4. Select **Save**. You will be prompted by the following dialog box:

   :::image type="content" source="media/change-export-slide-resolution/current-slide.png" alt-text="Screenshot of every slide option in PowerPoint dialog box.":::

    Select **Current Slide Only**. The slide is saved in the new format and resolution in the location that you specified in the **Save in** box.
5. To verify that the slide is saved in the resolution that you specified, right-click the picture, and then select **Properties**.

## Limitations

When you set the **ExportBitmapResolution** registry value in PowerPoint, there's a maximum DPI limitation to consider for some versions of PowerPoint.

Maximum DPI is dependent upon the slide size. The formula is as follows:
maxdpi = (sqrt(100,000,000 / (slide with * slide height)), where slide width and height are in inches.

For example, for a standard 13.3" x 7.5" slide, the equation would be:
sqrt(100,000,000 / (13.333 * 7.5) ) = 1000.

### PowerPoint 2019, 2016, 2013, and 365

There is no fixed DPI limit. Slide export is limited only by how large the resulting bitmap gets. PowerPoint can support bitmaps up to 100,000,000 pixels (width x height). For standard widescreen slides (13.3" x 7.5"), this means a maximum DPI of 1,000. For the older style 10" x 7.5" slides, this typically means a maximum DPI of 1,155.

### PowerPoint 2010 and older

The maximum resolution that PowerPoint can export is 3,072 pixels, based on the longest edge of the slide. For example, the standard 10" × 7.5" slide has a maximum effective DPI value of 307. The 3,070-pixel result (10 × 307 = 3070) falls within the 3,072-pixel limit. However, any DPI setting that's greater than 307 for a standard slide reverts to the limit of 3,072.

|Decimal value|Pixels (horizontal × vertical)|Dots per inch (horizontal and vertical)|
|---|---|---|
|307|3072 × 2304|307 dpi|

The 3,072-pixel limit also applies to saving the slide programmatically.

For example, the following code programmatically saves a picture that has the dimensions of 3072 × 2304 pixels:

```powershell
ActiveWindow.Selection.SlideRange(1).export
"c:\<filename>.jpg","JPG",4000,3000
```
