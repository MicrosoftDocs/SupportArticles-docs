### How to create custom timing values

For example, to create custom timing values for an animated rectangle, follow these steps, as appropriate for the version of PowerPoint that you are running.

#### Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 or Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003

1. Start PowerPoint.
2. Create a blank slide.
3. On the Drawing toolbar, click the Rectangle button, and then create a rectangle on the slide.
4. On the Slide Show menu, click Custom Animation.
5. In the Custom Animation task pane, click Add Effect, point to Entrance, and then click Blinds.
6. Click the arrow next to the entrance effect that you added. This is Rectangle 1. Then, click Effect Options.
7. Click the Timing tab, click the Speed box, and then type the number 5.

    This procedure sets the animation speed to five seconds. The Speed box accepts numeric entries up to a maximum value of 863990 seconds. The **Speed** box also accepts time entries in the "hh:mm:ss" time format up to a maximum value of "59:59:59".
8. Click the Repeat box, and then type the number 7.

    This procedure causes the animation to repeat seven times. The Repeat box accepts numeric values between 1 and 9999.
9. Click OK.
