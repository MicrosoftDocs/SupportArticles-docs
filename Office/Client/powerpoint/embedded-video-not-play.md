# Embedded videos don't play when you export a presentation as a video 

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You create a presentation in Microsoft Office PowerPoint.   
- On a slide, you insert a video.   
- On the **Animations** tab, you click **Add Animation**.   
- In the **Media** area, you click **Pause**.   
- In the **Timing** group, in the **Start** drop-down list, you click **With Previous**.   
- In the **Delay** field, you set a delay time for playing the video.   
- On the **File** tab, you click **Save & Send**, and then you click **Create a Video**.   
- You do not change the default settings, you click **Create Video**, and then you save the movie file.   

In this scenario, when you play the exported video file, the movie starts playing. However, the slide transitions before the video finishes playing.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the **Pause** animation effect starts the video and then pauses the video for the **Delay** time. This does not affect the duration of the slide when you export the presentation as a video. The default setting for slide duration when you export a video is 5 seconds. The slide transitions before the video finishes playing. 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

### Change the Animation settings

1. Select the video that you want to play after a short delay.   
2. On the **Animations** tab, in the **Animation** group, click **Play**.   
3. In the **Timing** group, in the **Start** drop-down list, click **With Previous**.   
4. Set the **Delay** to the time that you want.   
5. Export the presentation as a video.   

### Set the slide duration

1. On the **Transitions** tab, in the **Timing** group, under **Advance Slide**, click to select the **After** check box.   
2. Set the slide duration so that it is longer than the length of both videos combined. This allows for any delay in the playing of the videos.   

When you export the presentation as a video, make sure that you select **Use Recorded Times and Narrations** before you click **Create Video**.
