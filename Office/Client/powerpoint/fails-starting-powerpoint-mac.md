> [!WARNING]

### Step 2: Remove PowerPoint Preferences

1. On the **Go** menu, click **Home**.
1. Open Library.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The Library folder is hidden in MAC OS X Lion. To display this folder, hold down the OPTION key while you click the Go menu.

1. Open the Preferences folder.
1. Look for a file that is named com.microsoft.powerpoint.plist. If you locate the file, move it to the desktop. Start PowerPoint, and check whether the problem still occurs. If you cannot locate the file, the application is using the default preferences.
1. If the problem still occurs, quit PowerPoint, and restore the file to its original location. Then, go to the next step. If the problem seems to be resolved, you can move the com.microsoft.powerpoint.plist file to the trash.

### Step 3: Perform a clean startup

For information how to "clean start" your computer, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[2398596](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2398596) How to use a "clean startup" to determine whether background programs are interfering with Office for Mac

If the problem continues to occur, go to the next step.

### Step 4: Create a new user account

Sometimes, a specific user's information may become corrupted, and this may prevent installation, startup, or use of some applications. To determine whether this is the case, you can log on to the computer by using a different or new user account, and then test the application.

If the problem no longer occurs, the cause exists within the user's home folder. If you think that the user account was responsible, you can continue to troubleshoot by using the new user account.

> [!NOTE]
> For help moving your user files to the new account, contact Apple.

If the problem continues to occur, go to the next step.

### Step 5: Use the "Repair Disk Permissions" option

You can use the Repair Disk Permissions option to troubleshoot permissions problems in Mac OS X 10.2 and later versions. If the permissions for your Microsoft software are incorrect, Office for Mac applications may start slowly or perform slowly. To use the Repair Disk Permissions option, follow these steps:

1. On the Go menu, click Utilities.
2. Start the Disk Utility program.
3. Click the primary hard disk drive for your computer.
4. Click the First Aid tab.
5. Click Repair Disk Permissions.

> [!NOTE]
> The Disk Utility program only repairs software that is installed by Apple. This utility also repairs folders, such as the Applications folder. However, this utility does not repair software that is in your home folder.

### Step 6: Remove and then reinstall Office
