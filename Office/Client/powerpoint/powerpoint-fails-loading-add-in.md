# PowerPoint cannot load an add-in when you lower the macro security level

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you lower the level of macro security in Microsoft PowerPoint, and then open a PowerPoint add-in file (*.ppa), the new level of macro security may not be applied, and the add-in file may not run as expected. The add-in is listed as an available add-in in the Add-Ins dialog box, but the check box is not selected, and you receive an error message similar to the following when you attempt to select the check box:

**PowerPoint couldn't load the add-in *file name***.

## Cause

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

1. You attempt to open a PowerPoint add-in file by using the Open command on the File menu while the macro security level is set to High.
2. You lower the macro security-level setting.
3. You open the same PowerPoint add-in file by using the Open command on the File menu.

When you attempt to open an add-in file, and the add-in is not loaded because of macro security, PowerPoint temporarily stores (caches) the failure-to-load information about this add-in. PowerPoint cannot load the add-in after you lower the macro security level until it clears the cached information.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, clear the cached information, and then load the add-in by following either of the following methods after you change the macro security-level setting.

### Method 1: Quit and Restart PowerPoint

1. Quit PowerPoint.
2. Restart PowerPoint.
3. Open the add-in file.
4. Click "I AGREE" to load the add-in.

### Method 2: Remove and Add the Add-in

To remove and add the add-in in PowerPoint 2002, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Add-Ins.
2. In the Available Add-Ins list, click the add-in, and then click Remove.
3. Click Add New, select the add-in, click OK, click "I AGREE" to load the add-in, and then click Close.

To remove the add-in in PowerPoint 2007, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Microsoft Office Button**, click **PowerPoint Options**, and then click **Add-Ins**.
2. In the **Manage** list, select **PowerPoint Add-ins**, and then click **Go**.
3. In the **Available Add-Ins** list, select the add-in that you want to remove, click **Remove**, and then click **Close**.

To add the add-in in PowerPoint 2007, follow these steps:

1. Click the **Microsoft Office Button**, click **PowerPoint Options**, and then click **Add-Ins**.
2. In the **Manage** list, click **PowerPoint Add-ins**, and then click **Go**.
3. In the **Add-Ins** dialog box, click **Add New**.
4. In the **Add New PowerPoint Add-In** dialog box, browse for the add-in that you want to add, and then click **OK**.
5. A security notice appears. If you are sure that the add-in comes from a trusted source, click **Enable Macros**, and then click **Close**.

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.
