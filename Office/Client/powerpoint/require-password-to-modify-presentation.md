# Password to modify a presentation is required when you open the presentation in PowerPoint

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

If you save a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that requires a password to modify the presentation, but not a password to open the presentation, you are still required to type a password the next time that you open the presentation.

When you attempt to open the presentation, you receive the following message regardless of whether you intend to modify or just open the presentation: 

```asciidoc
Password 'Filename.ppt' is reserved by 'username'.

Enter password to modify, or open read only.

You can either type the password, click Cancel to stop the file-open process, or open the file in a read-only format.
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because PowerPoint prompts you for any password applied to a presentation as soon as you open the presentation file, regardless of whether the password is used to modify or just open the file.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, click Read Only when you are first prompted for a password when you open the file. If you want to modify the presentation, type the password at this time.

### Methods to protect a presentation from unauthorized users

#### Require a password to modify the document

To allow all users to open the document but allow only authorized users to make changes to it, you can assign a password, which the user is required to type before modifying the document. If a user modifies the document without using the password, that user can save the document only by giving it a different file name.

If you type a password in the **Password to modify** box, users are prompted for a password when they open the presentation. The presentation is opened when the user types the correct password. Or, the user can open the presentation as read-only.

#### Require a password to open the document

To prevent unauthorized users from opening a document at all, you can assign a password to your presentation.

If you type a password in the **Password to open** box, the presentation is opened when the user types the correct password. If the user forgets or loses the password, he or she cannot open the presentation.
