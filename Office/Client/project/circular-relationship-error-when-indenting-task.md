# Circular Relationship error When indenting task

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

In Microsoft Project, if two tasks are linked in a predecessor/successor relationship and you indent the successor to make it a subtask and the predecessor of a summary task, you may receive the following error message:

    This outline change would create a circular relationship.

    Indenting these tasks would create an illogical relationship with other tasks.

    Check the task dependencies for the tasks from which you are indenting, and then try again.

##  Cause

This problem occurs when the predecessor task has a cross-project link as a predecessor and the task you are trying to subordinate is its successor. For example, let's say you have two tasks (A and B). They are linked by a Finish to Start relationship and Task A has a cross-project link to a task in another project. If you indent task B under Task A, you will receive this error message.

##  Workaround

To work around this problem, remove the predecessor and successor link between the tasks and then indent the task.
