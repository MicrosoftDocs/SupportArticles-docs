# How to create a report template in Project 2013

## Introduction 

This article describes how to create a report template in Microsoft Project 2013.

**Note** When you click Copy Reporton the DESIGNtab of the REPORT TOOLScontextual tab for a project plan in Microsoft Project 2013, a report template is not created. Instead, the report is copied to the clipboard so that you can paste it into other applications. This behavior is by design.

To create a new report template to use with other project plans, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1

1. Select a report from an open project plan, and then change the report.   
2. Click **FILE**, and then click **Organizer**. Select the Reports tab in the Organizer dialog box, and then rename the report.   
3. On the **Reports** tab of the **Organizer** dialog box, copy the report to the Global.mpt file so that the report can be used in other project plans.   

### Method 2

1. Click **New Report** on the REPORT tab in Project 2013, select a kind of report, and then name the report.    
2. Customize the report, and then save the report to the Global.mpt file.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The Global.mpt file is installed in the following location:
>
>    \<system device\>:\Users\\\<your login name\>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\MS Project\15\1033
> - You can share the Global.mpt file with other users so that they can access the new report also.
