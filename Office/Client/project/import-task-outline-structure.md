# Importing a Task Outline Structure into Project

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Summary

When you import files from a different application to Microsoft Project, you can include information that will allow Microsoft Project to generate a project outline structure for the imported file.

##  More Information

You cannot directly import the Outline Number field from a file saved in a format other than the standard Microsoft Project format. However, it is possible to import a different field that will correctly generate the same outline structure.

Microsoft Project uses a task field called "Outline Level", in conjunction with the order tasks are imported, to determine where tasks fall in a project outline structure. Tasks with Outline Level=1 are at the highest level in the project outline. Tasks with Outline Level=2 are subordinate to level 1 tasks, level 3 tasks are subordinate to level 2 tasks, and so on, for example:

A comma-separated values (CSV) file contains the following text:

 1, Summary Task 1

 2, Task A

 2, Task B

 2, Summary Task 2

 3, Task C

 3, Task D

 1, Summary Task 3

 2, Task E

 2, Task F

 If this file is imported into Microsoft Project using a task table with Outline Level and Name as its first two fields, the tasks will be imported with the following outline structure:

|Outline Level|Name|
|--|--|
|1| 1 Summary Task 1|
 |2 |1.1 Task A|
 |2 |1.2 Task B|
 |2| 1.3 Summary Task 2|
 |3| 1.3.1 Task C|
 |3| 1.3.2 Task D|
 |1| 2 Summary Task 3|
 |2| 2.1 Task E|
 |2| 2.2 Task F|
 **NOTE** The Outline Number and name indentation are shown to clearly illustrate the structure.
