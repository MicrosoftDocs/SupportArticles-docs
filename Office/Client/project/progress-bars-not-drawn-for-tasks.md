# Progress bars not drawn for tasks that are in progress in Project

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

In Microsoft Project, in a Gantt Chart view, task progress bars may not be displayed when there is progress on a task.

##  Cause

This behavior may be caused by either of the following two conditions.

### Condition 1: Resource Calendar Is 24 Hours

The resource calendar for the resource assigned to the task is based on the 24 Hours base calendar, or the resource calendar's working time is 24 hours.

**NOTE** Condition 1 only occurs in Project 2003 and earlier versions.

### Condition 2: Progress Bar Style Deleted

You deleted the progress bar style from the Bar Styles dialog box in a Gantt Chart view.

**NOTE** For condition 2, the behavior occurs on all tasks in the view.

To verify if the progress bar style exists or has been deleted, follow these steps:


1. On the men ribbon's Format tab, click the arrown in the right corner of the Chart Style section to view Bar Styles. In Project 2010, choose the Format tab, click Format, and then click Bar Styles. NOTE: In Project 2007 and earlier versons, click BarStyleson the Formatmenu.   
2. By default, a progress bar style is listed in the Name column with Progress as the name. You can also identify a progress bar in the Bar Styles dialog box, where Actual Start is in the From column and Complete Through is in the To column.   


##  Workaround

### Condition 1: Resource Calendar Is 24 Hours

To work around condition 1, change the definition for the Progress bar style. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click the Gantt Chart that you want to edit.   
2. On the Format menu, click Bar Styles.   
3. In the Progress bar definition, change Complete Through to Stop in the To column.   
4. Click OK.
