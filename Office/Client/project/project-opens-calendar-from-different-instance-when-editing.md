# Microsoft Project opens a calendar from a different instance when editing

## Symptoms

When you open a calendar created from a Project Work App (PWA) instance in a Microsoft Project client, a calendar from a different PWA instance opens instead.

## Cause

Project client uses a site ID when opening a calendar. If both instances of the PWA are created from the same site collection, then the site ID will be same for both instances of the PWA.

> [!Note]
> This can happen when the production content database uses the same database to provision PWA in a test or QA environment.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, designate one account in the Project client as the default account by using the following steps:
1. Select **Info**, select **Manage Accounts**, then select **Configure Accounts**.

2. Select an account and click **Set as Default**.
3. Select **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To edit the calendar of a production environment PWA, select the Production account and then select **OK**.

4. Close the Project client and open the calendar again.

## How to check the Site ID

To check the Site ID, access the following registry location in the local machine (the profile name will be the name of the profile created to connect to the PWA instance):

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\MS Project\Profiles\<Profile Name>`
