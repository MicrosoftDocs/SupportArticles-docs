# Incompatibilities between Office programs and Adobe Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin

## Resolution

If you have the AdobeAcrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin add-in installed on your computer and your Office programs are crashing or unresponsive, this could mean that the current version that's installed on your computer is incompatible with your version of Office.

To check whether the add-in is installed on your computer and you're running Office 2010, open any Office application, and then click **File** > **Add-Ins**.

For Office 2013 and later versions, click File > Options > Add-Ins. You should see something that resembles the following:
