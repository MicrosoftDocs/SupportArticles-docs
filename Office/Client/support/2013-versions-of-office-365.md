## Ending support for the 2013 versions of Office 365 client applications

This article explains that support for the 2013 versions of Office 365 client applications ended on February 28, 2017.
> [!NOTE]

To learn about the support dates for the Office 2013 Professional Plus, Professional, and Standard editions, see [Microsoft support lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/?p1=16674).

Users who are running the 2013 versions of Office 365 client applications after February 28, 2017, must upgrade to the latest version of Office 365 client applications to continue to receive support from Microsoft. The following is a list of products for which support will end:

- Office 365 Personal (2013)
- Project Pro for Office 365 (2013)

After February 28, 2017:
- All 2013 versions of Office 365 client applications (32-bit and 64-bit) and all 2013 language packs are no longer available for installation from the Office 365 admin center.
- Microsoft is not releasing any feature updates for these versions of the products.
- Microsoft is not providing support for these versions of the products through either Customer Service and Support (CSS) or Microsoft Premier Support.
- Microsoft will continue to release critical and important security updates for these versions of the products until April 10, 2023. For more information, see [Security Bulletin Severity Rating System](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/gg309177.aspx).
- Microsoft will not provide any notification before implementing potentially disruptive changes that may result in a service interruption for users of the 2013 versions of Office 365 client applications.

## Moving to the latest version of Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise

1. Contact the [FastTrack Center](https://aka.ms/requestonboarding) to get help for your Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise deployment or review the [Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise deployment content](https://docs.microsoft.com/deployoffice/).

2. Learn about the Office update channel model.

   Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise ships in update channels. These different update channels let you control how often your organization gets new features. For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252f9ccf0f13-28ff-4975-9bd2-7e4ea2fefef4).

3. Create a group of users for validation and testing.

   This group could include the IT team or early adopters, and it will give them an opportunity to become comfortable with the new capabilities and test any LOB integrations that are critical to your business. For more information, see [Overview of update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/DeployOffice/overview-of-update-channels-for-office-365-proplus?redirectSourcePath=%252fen-us%252farticle%252f9ccf0f13-28ff-4975-9bd2-7e4ea2fefef4).

4. Determine which Exchange Server configuration is needed for your organization.

   **Option 1: Move to Exchange Online in Office 365**

   Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise is built to support Exchange Online and the other Office 365 workloads. Customers deployed on Office 365 will always be up to date without a worry of end of support deadlines. The Microsoft FastTrack Center is ready to help and will provide on-boarding guidance and data migration services to all eligible Office 365 customers.  

   **Option 2: Upgrade to the latest version of Exchange Server**

   You can upgrade to a on-premises version of Exchange Server that supports Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, such as Exchange Server 2019. For more information, see [System requirements for Office](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements) and [Exchange Server supportability matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/plan-and-deploy/supportability-matrix#clients).
   
   If you plan to upgrade Exchange Server, verify that the Exchange Server Autodiscover service is functional, as Outlook for Office 365 no longer supports the option to manually set an Exchange account.
   
   For more information, see [Autodiscover service](https://docs.microsoft.com/Exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover).
