# Incompatibilities between Office programs and Adobe Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Add-in

## Summary

If you have the Adobe Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM add-in installed on your computer and your Office programs are crashing or not responding, this might mean that the version of PDFMaker you have installed is incompatible with your version of Office.

## More information

To verify that the PDFMaker add-in is installed on your computer, do the following:

- Office 2010: Open any Office application, and then select **File** > **Add-Ins**.
- Office 2013 and later versions, select **File** > **Options** > **Add-Ins**. Next to **Manage COM Add-ins** select **Go**. You will see a dialog box that resembles the following screenshot:

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Upgrade your Adobe product

> [!NOTE]
> Fees may apply when you upgrade your Adobe product.

See [Compatible web browsers and PDFMaker applications](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/compatible-web-browsers-pdfmaker-applications.html) to determine which version of the Adobe Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM add-in is compatible with your Office version. If your version isn't compatible, try to upgrade your Adobe product to a later version that's compatible with your Office version.

If you're an advanced user and want to check the PDFMOfficeAddin.dll version compatibility, see the following table.

|Office version|Supported PDFMaker add-in versions (check PDFMOfficeAddin.dll version)|
|--|--|
|2010 (32-bit)|10.x and later|
|2010 (64-bit)|10.1 and later|
|2013 (32-bit)|11.0.1 and later|
|2013 (64-bit)|11.0.1 and later|
|2016 (32-bit)|11.0.16 and later|
|2016 (64-bit)|11.0.16 and later|

### Method 2: Manually disable Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Add-in

If you have administrative permissions, you can also disable the add-in by following these steps in each Office program:

1. Open the Office program, and then select**File** > **Options** > **Add-ins**.
2. In the Manage drop-down list, select **COM Add-Ins**, and then select **Go**.
3. Clear the **Acrobat PDFMaker Office COM Addin** check box, as follows (Office 2010 screen shot), and then select **OK**.
