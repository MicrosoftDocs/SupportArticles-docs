# You cannot change the text or shape fill color in Visio when using a High Contrast Windows theme

## Symptoms 

When changing the text color or shape fill color within a Visio 2013 or Visio 2010 drawing, the changes are not displayed on screen. However, the changes are reflected on a physical printout.

## Cause 

This issue can occur if a Windows High Contrast theme is applied to the machine.

## Resolution 

To remove the High Contrast theme, right click the desktop background and go to Personalize. Select a theme that does not contain "High Contrast" in the title.
