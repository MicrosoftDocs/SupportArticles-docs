# You can't open Visio files in Visio Web Access even if Visio Viewer is installed

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You are running Internet Explorer.   
- You have Visio Viewer installed on the computer.   
- You try to open Microsoft Office Visio files in Visio Web Access.   
In this scenario, when you click Open in Visio, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
To open this document, your computer must be running a supported version of Microsoft Visio and a browser that supports opening files directly from Visio Web Access
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because Visio Web Access invokes the client application by using the **ms-visio:ofv|u|documenturl** protocol, but Visio Viewer doesn't support or process this protocol.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, install [Microsoft Office Visio](https://products.office.com/en-US/Visio). 

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed in the "Applies to" section.
