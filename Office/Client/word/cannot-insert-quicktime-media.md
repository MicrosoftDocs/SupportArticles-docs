# "PowerPoint cannot insert a video from the selected file" when you insert an MPEG-4 or QuickTime Movie file into a presentation

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

On a slide in the 64-bit version of Microsoft PowerPoint 2013 or 2010, you try to insert a movie that uses one of following Apple QuickTime video and audio formats: 

- MPEG-4 video (*.mp4)

- MPEG-4 audio (*.m4a)

- QuickTime Movie (*.mov)

When you try to insert one of these formats, you receive the following error message: 

"PowerPoint cannot insert a video from the selected file. Verify that the necessary 64-bit codec for this media format is installed, and then try again."

## Cause

This issue occurs because currently the Windows operating system does not have a 64-bit video or audio codec for the three QuickTime media formats. 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, you can convert these video or audio files to the Windows Media Video file format (*.wmv) by using a third-party video or audio file converter.
