# Changes to Settings are not updated in the Preview window when you print in Microsoft Word

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You create or you open a document in Microsoft Word 2010 or later. 
- You click the **File** tab, and then click **Print**.   
- Under **Settings**, you change how the document prints. For example, you change the **Pages Per Sheet** setting.   

In this scenario, the Preview window does not update the changes that you make dealing with how the document prints.

## Resolution

There is no resolution or workaround for this issue. This issue only affects the Preview window. 

> [!NOTE]
> When you click **Print**, Word sends the document to the printer by using the settings that you specified. 

For example, you change the **Pages Per Sheet** setting to **2 Pages Per Sheet**. The Preview window does not update this change. However when you click **Print**, Word sends the document to the printer to print 2 pages on 1 printed sheet.

## More Information

You may experience these symptoms when you change the following settings:

- Page orientation   
- Page ranges   
- Duplex printing   
- Black & white printing for black-and-white printers
