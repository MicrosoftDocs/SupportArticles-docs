# How to configure the default search engine in Word 2013

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Introduction

Microsoft Word 2013 includes a feature that lets you use a search engine to search for a word in a Word document. By default, the search is performed by Bing. However, you can configure the feature to use a different search engine.

## More Information

To change the search engine that used to perform the search, create registry entries named SearchProviderName and SearchProviderURI, and then change these registry entries. For example, to configure Office.com as the default search engine, follow the steps that are described in the "Registry key information" section.

**Note** If the SearchProviderName and SearchProviderURI registry entries already exist, change these registry entries to specify the search engine that you want to use as the default search engine.

### Registry key information

Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
