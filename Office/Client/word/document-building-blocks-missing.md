# Document building blocks may be missing in a template that is part of a workgroup template in Word 2010

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Office Word 2010, document building blocks may be missing in a template that is part of a workgroup template.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains information about how to modify the registry. Make sure to back up the registry before you modify it. Make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up, restore, and modify the registry, see [Windows registry information for advanced users](/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users).

## Cause

This issue occurs because the workgroup path for building block templates differs from the path for regular templates.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

### Method 1

> [!WARNING]
> Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

Use Registry Editor to set the **SharedDocumentParts** key in the following registry subkey to the path of the shared template:

- Office 2010: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common`

To do so, follow these steps:

1. select **Start**, select **Run**, type *regedit*, and then select **OK**.
2. Locate and then select the following key in the registry:

   - Office 2010:`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0`

3. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Key**.
4. Type *Common*, and then select **ENTER**.
5. Locate and then select the following key in the registry:

   - Office 2010: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0`

6. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Key**.
7. Type General, and then select **ENTER**.
8. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then select **String Value**.
9. On the **Edit** menu, select **Modify**.

10. Type *SharedDocumentParts*, and then select **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Set the key string value to `\\server\share`.

### Method 2

Turn on the Group Policy to set the shared location for templates. To do this, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in Method 2 result in the same registry setting as in Method 1.

1. Download and then install the Administrative Templates from the 2010 Office Resource Kit.

2. Copy the *office14.adm* file to the folder: *c:\windows\inf*.

3. Select **Start**, select **Run**, type *gpedit.msc*, and then select **OK**.

4. In the Group Policy Object Editor, right-click **Administrative Templates** under **User Configuration**, and then select **Add/Remove Templates**.

5. In the **Add/Remove Templates** dialog box, select **Add**, for Office 2010 type *c:\windows\inf\office14.adm* in the **File name** box, and then select **Open**.

6. Select **Close** to close the **Add/Remove Templates** dialog box.

7. In the Group Policy Object Editor, expand **Administrative Templates** under **User Configuration**, expand **Microsoft Office 2010 system**, and then select **Shared paths**.

8. In the **Shared Paths** pane, double-click **Workgroup build blocks path**.

9. In the **Workgroup build blocks path** dialog box, on the **Setting** tab, select **Enable** radio-button, and then type location of the building blocks in this format `\\server\share`.
