# "end tag" error occurs when you open a DOCX file in Word 2013, 2010, or 2007

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

When you try to open a Microsoft Word 2007, 2010 or 2013 document, you may receive this error message:

**In Word 2007 and Word 2010:**

    The file <document filename> cannot be opened because there are problems with the contents.
 
Clicking the **Details** button provides this additional information:

    The name in the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag. 
 ![The name in the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag](./media/end-tag-error-when-open-docx/the-name-in-the-end-tag-of-the-element-must-match.jpg)

**In Word 2013:**

    We're sorry. We can't open <document filename.docx> because we found a problem with its contents. 
 Clicking the **Details** button provides this additional information:
 
    The name in the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag.

![The name in the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag](./media/end-tag-error-when-open-docx/the-name-in-the-end-tag-of-the-element-must-match.png) 

##  Cause

This issue is related strictly to oMath tags and occurs when a graphical object or text box is anchored to the same paragraph that contains the equation. The document will display the equation and object on the same line as demonstrated in this image:

![The document will display the equation and object on the same line as demonstrated in this image](./media/end-tag-error-when-open-docx/the-document-will-display-the-equation-and-object.jpg)

The error may not occur until the document is saved, re-edited and saved again.

##  Resolution

Office 2013 and Office 2010 Service Pack 1 resolves this issue for new files. It will also prevent the problem from recurring with any files that were recovered with the Fix it solution in this article.

If you currently have Office 2010 installed on your computer, we recommend that you follow these steps:

**Step 1**

**Step 2**

If you are familiar with editing XML, you can try to fix the problem yourself by correcting the mismatched oMath tags in the document. See the following example:

```xml
Incorrect tags:

<mc:AlternateContent>

<mc:Choice Requires="wps">

<m:oMath>

…

</mc:AlternateContent>

</m:oMath>

Correct tags:

<m:oMath>

<mc:AlternateContent>

<mc:Choice Requires="wps">

…

</mc:AlternateContent>

</m:oMath>
```

**Note** You will have to use an application such as Notepad to edit the XML.
