# The "Embed Linguistic Data" setting in the "Word Options" dialog box isn't saved in Word

## Symptoms

You click to clear the **Embed Linguistic Data** check box for all documents in the **Preserve fidelity when sharing this document** section of the **Advanced** tab in the **Word Options** dialog box. However, when you then restart Microsoft Office Word, the **Embed Linguistic Data** check box is selected.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Embed Linguistic Data** check box remains cleared as long as Word is running.

## More information

The Embed Linguistic Data feature determines whether handwriting recognition correction information is stored in the Word document when you save the document in a Word 97 - 2003 format. Word doesn't support the embedding of handwriting recognition correction information when you save the document in the Word (*.docx) format.
