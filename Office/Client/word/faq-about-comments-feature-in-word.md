# Frequently asked questions about the Comments feature in Word

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

A comment is a note or annotation that an author or reviewer can add to a document. Microsoft Word displays the comment in the Reviewing pane or in a balloon in the margin of the document.

This article answers some frequently asked questions about the Comment feature in Word. 

## More Information

### What is a balloon?

A balloon shows markup elements (for example, comments) in the margins of your document so that it doesn't cover text or affect the layout of the document. You can use balloons in Print Layout view or in Web Layout view to easily see and respond to reviewers' changes and comments. 

### How do I view the comments in a Word document?

To view the comments in a document, follow these steps:

**Word 2010 and Word 2007** 
 
- On the **Review** tab, click **Show Markup** in the **Tracking** group, and then select the **Comments** check box. If you do not see the comment balloon, click Print Layout or Web Layout on the View tab.    
 
**Word 2003 and Word 2002** 
 
- On the View menu, click Markup. Word displays balloons in your document for each comment. If you do not see the comment balloon, click Print Layout or Web Layout on the View menu.    
 
### How do I hide the comments in my Word document?

To hide the comments, follow these steps:

**Word 2010 and Word 2007**

- On the **Review** tab, click **Show Markup** in the **Tracking** group, and then clear the **Comments** check box.

- On the **View** menu, click Markup. 

### How do I insert a comment?

To insert a comment, follow these steps:

**Word 2010 and Word 2007** 
 
1. On the **Review** tab, in the **Comments** group, click **New Comment**.     
2. Type your comment in the comment balloon that appears when you are in Print Layout view or Web Layout view, or in the Reviewing pane when you are in Normal view or Outline view.    
 
**Word 2003 and Word 2002** 
 
1. Select the text or item that you want to comment about, or click the place where you want to insert your comment.    
2. On the Insert menu, click Comment.

To change an existing comment, do one of the following:
