# Graphics and images don't display correctly in 32-bit version of Word

## Symptoms

You find that after upgrading to Windows 10, graphics or images do not display correctly in the 32-bit version of Microsoft Word.

## Cause

An older version of the file "d2d1.dll.mui" exists in the folder \windows\syswow64\en-us.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, delete the following file:

```
\windows\syswow64\en-us\d2d1.dll.mui
```

Restart Word. Word will then use the correct version of the file.
