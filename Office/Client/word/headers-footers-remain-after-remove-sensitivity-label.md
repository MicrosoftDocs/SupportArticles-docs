# Headers and footers remain after removing sensitivity label in Word for Microsoft 365

## Symptoms

After removing a sensitivity label from a Word for Microsoft 365 document,  the **Sensitivity** dropdown displays the correct sensitivity level, but the headers, footers, and other artifacts of the previous level remain. 

## Resolution

Microsoft has released an update for Word to correct this issue. Any documents created after August 12, 2020, will not be affected. Any documents created between May 21, 2020, and August 12, 2020, may still be affected by this issue. 

To resolve this issue on any affected document, perform the following steps: 

1.	Open the impacted document.
2.	Select the **Sensitivity** drop-down to apply a non-protected label.
3.	Wait five seconds.
4.	Use the **Sensitivity** drop-down to deselect the previously applied label.
5.	Close the document.
