# How to merge Word documents

If you have to combine separate Microsoft Word documents, you can copy and paste them together if they're short, or merge them if they're long.

> [!NOTE]
> The format might not stay the same when you merge documents.

1. Select the **Insert** tab.

3. Select the files to be merged into the current document. Press and hold **Ctrl** to select more than one document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Documents will be merged in the order in which they appear in the file list. To use a different order, select and insert each file individually in the desired order.
