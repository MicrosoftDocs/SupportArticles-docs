# How to merge Word documents

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

If you need to combine separate Word documents, you can copy and paste them together if they're short. For longer documents, you can merge them.

> [!NOTE]
> The following method applies both to Word 2010 and Word 2007. The format might not stay the same when you merge documents.

1. Select the **Insert** tab.

3. After that, you can select files to be merged into the current document. Press and hold **Ctrl** to select more than one document.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Documents will be merged in the order they appear in the file list. If you need to merge them in a different order, select each individually and insert in the order you want.
