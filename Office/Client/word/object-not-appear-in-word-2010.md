# A picture or an object may not appear in a Word 2010 or Word 2007 document

## Symptoms

When you open a Microsoft Office Word 2010 or Word 2007 document that contains a picture or an object, the picture or the object may not appear. This issue may occur in a document that contains a picture, a graphic image, an AutoShape object, or another object.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue may also occur in later versions of Word.

## Cause

This issue occurs if you are using a Wrapping style option other than the **In line with text** option with the picture or with the object. And, one of the following conditions is true:

- You are viewing the Word document in Draft view or in Outline view.   
- The **Show drawings and text boxes on screen** option is turned off.   
- The **Print drawings created in Word** option turned off.   
- The **Use draft quality** option is turned on.
- The **Show field codes instead of their values** option is turned on.

If you are using the **In line with text** option with the picture or with the object, this issue may occur if the **Picture Placeholders** option is turned on.

This issue may also occur if you are experiencing an issue with the video driver.

## Workaround

### You are using a Wrapping style option other than the "In line with text" option

If you are using a Wrapping style option other than the **In line with text** option, use one of the following workarounds.

#### Use the "In line with text" Wrapping style option

To change the Wrapping style option for a picture or for an object to **In line with text**, follow these steps, as appropriate for your version of Word.

##### Word 2007

1. Click the picture or the object.   
2. On the **Format** tab, click **Text Wrapping** in the **Arrange** group.   
3. Click **In line with text**.   

##### Word 2010

1. Click the picture or the object.   
2. On the **Format** tab, click **Text Wrapping** in the **Arrange** group.   
3. Click **In line with text**.   
When you use the **In line with text** option, the picture or the object will be displayed in any view. 

If you want to use a Wrapping style option other than the **In line with text** option, use one of the following workarounds.

#### Change the view

This issue may occur if you are viewing the document in Draft view or in Outline view. To work around this issue, view the document in one of the following views:

- Print Layout   
- Full Screen Reading   
- Web Layout   
- Print Preview for Word 2007. For 

Word 2010: Click **File**, and then click **Print**.   
Word 2010 and Word 2007 documents consist of separate text and drawing layers. When you use a Wrapping style option other than the **In line with text** option with a picture or with an object, the picture or the object is inserted into the drawing layer. Word 2010 and Word 2007 do not display the drawing layer when you view the document in Draft view or in Outline view. The drawing layer is displayed in a Word 2010 and in a Word 2007 document when you use any one of the views that are mentioned in this workaround.

#### Turn on the "Show drawings and text boxes on screen" option

When you turn on the **Show drawings and text boxes on screen** option, you can view the picture or the object in Print Layout view or in Web Layout view. To turn on the **Show drawings and text boxes on screen** option, follow these steps, as appropriate for your version of Word.
