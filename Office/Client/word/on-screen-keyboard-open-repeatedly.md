# On-screen keyboard opens repeatedly in Word Online

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario: 

- You have a Chromebook, a Chromebook tablet, or some other device that runs the Chrome operating system.    
- A keyboard is attached to the device.    
- You use Word Online.    

In this scenario, the on-screen keyboard opens repeatedly.

For example, a user opens a document on a Chrome-based device that has a physical keyboard connected. The user clicks a section of the document, and starts typing. However, the on-screen keyboard opens. The user dismisses the on-screen keyboard, and continues typing. When the user moves to another section of the document, the on-screen keyboard opens again and must be dismissed again.  

## Cause

This issue occurs because of the manner in which the Chrome operating system detects editable content. The Word Online team cannot change this behavior. 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, disable the automatic keyboard in the device settings. To do this, follow these steps:  

1. Tap or click your account photo.    
2. Tap or click **Settings**.    
3. At the bottom, tap or click **Advanced**.    
4. Under **Accessibility**, tap or click **Manage accessibility features**.    
5. Under **Keyboard**, turn off **Enable on-screen keyboard**.

For more detailed instructions, see the "Turn off on-screen keyboard" section in [Use the on-screen keyboard](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/6076237) on the Google website.
