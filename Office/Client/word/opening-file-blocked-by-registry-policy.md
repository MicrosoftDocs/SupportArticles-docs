# Opening a file is blocked by your registry policy setting or File Block settings in Word

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

Error messages you may receive when you open a file in Microsoft Word. 

Error message 1

    You are attempting to open a file type that is blocked by your registry policy setting.

Error message 2

    You are attempting to open a file that was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Office. This file type is blocked from opening in this version by your registry policy setting.

Error message 3 
    
    You are attempting to open a file type File_Type that has been blocked by your File Block settings in the Trust Center. 

##  Resolution

To fix this issue, disable the restriction on opening documents of certain types. 
### Method 1: Disable the restriction by yourself
**Word 2013 and Word 2010**

 
1. Click the **File** tab.    
2. Under **Help**, click **Options**.

   ![Options](./media/opening-file-blocked-by-registry-policy/options.png)    
1. Click **Trust Center**, and then click **Trust Center Settings**.

   ![Trust Center Settings](./media/opening-file-blocked-by-registry-policy/trust-center-settings.png)    
4. In the **Trust Center**, click **File Block Settings**.    
5. To enable the opening of a file that is blocked, clear the check box for that file type.
 ![To enable the opening of a file that is blocked](./media/opening-file-blocked-by-registry-policy/to-enable-the-opening-of-a-file-that-is-blocked.png)

6. Click **OK** two times.    

**Word 2007** 

To disable this restriction in Word 2007, change the value of the FileOpenBlock subkey.   
To disable or enable the file restriction yourself, follow these steps: 
 
1. Exit Word.    
2. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.    
3. Locate and then click the following registry subkey: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Security\FileOpenBlock** 
    
   If the FileOpenBlock subkey does not exist, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:
   1. Select the **Security** subkey.    
   2. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Key**.    
   3. Type FileOpenBlock, and then press ENTER.    
     
4. After you select the subkey that is specified in step 3, locate the DWORD value.

   Note If this value does not exist, you must create it. To do this, follow these steps:  
    1. On the **Edit** menu, point to **New**, and then click **DWORD Value**.    
    2. Type the DWORD value for which you want to disable the restriction, and then press ENTER. For example, type FilesBeforeVersion.    
 
   You may check the different DWORD values in the "More Information" section of this article based on the version of Word that you are running. For example, if the opening of files that were saved in earlier file formats is restricted, locate the FilesBeforeVersion DWORD value in the registry for the FileOpenBlock subkey. When you change the value of FilesBeforeVersion from 1 to 0, you can open files that were saved in earlier file formats.    
5. Right-click the DWORD value that you want, and then click **Modify**.    
6. In the **Value data** box, type 0, and then click **OK**.    
7. On the **File** menu, click **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.    

**Word 2003**

For more information about how to disable the restriction in Word 2003, see [Information about certain file types that are blocked after you install Office 2003 Service Pack 3.](https://support.microsoft.com/help/938810)    
### Method 2 Using Administrative Template files and the Office Customization Tool to disable the restriction
#### Word 2013, Word 2010, and Word 2007  

Download the Administrative Template files and Office Customization Tool from the following websites: 
[Office 2013 Administrative Template files (ADM, ADMX/ADML) and Office Customization Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35554)

Note This update provides updated Group Policy template files either to enable an override of the files that are blocked by default or to block additional file types.

 The file type can be selected only if the **Enabled** option is selected to select a file type.      
To fix this issue if you do not want to disable the restriction: 
### Method 3 Use a trusted location, or create an exempt location
**Word 2013, Word 2010, and Word 2007**  

If you trust the file that you want to open, you can open that file even if the file type is blocked by the registry. You can override the registry policy settings by moving the file to a trusted location.

For more information about how to create, to remove, or to change a trusted location for files, go to one of the following websites: 

[Plan Trusted Locations settings for Office 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179039%28office.14%29.aspx)

 [Plan Trusted Locations settings for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179039%28office.14%29.aspx)

**Word 2003**  

In Word 2003, there are no trusted locations. You can create an exempt location to override the registry policy settings.

To create an exempt location, follow these steps  
 
1. Exit Word 2003.    
2. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.    
3. Locate and then click one of the following registry subkeys: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common**
 **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Common**     
4. Point to **New** on the **Edit** menu, and then click **Key**.    
5. Type OICEExemptions for the name of the key.    
6. Point to **New** on the **Edit** menu, and then click **String Value**.    
7. Type a string name, and then press ENTER. For example, type ExemptDirectory.    
8. Right-click the string name that you typed in step 7, and then click **Modify**.    
9. In the **Value data** box, type the path of the directory that contains the file, and then click **OK**. For example, if your document is in the C:\My Documents folder, type C:\My Documents in the **Value data** box.

   Note You must create the folder. Subfolders are not automatically exempt. For additional folders that you would like to make exempt, repeat steps 6 to 9 by creating string values such as "ExemptDirectory1," and "ExemptDirectory2."    
10. On the **File** menu, click **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.

##  Cause

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is true:


- You are using Word 2013 or Word 2010, and you try to open a file that was saved in one of the following earlier Word formats. (Word 2013 and Word 2010 do not support documents that were saved in the following Word formats.) 
  - Microsoft Word for Windows 1.**x**   
  - Microsoft Word for Windows 2.**x**   
  - Microsoft Word for the Macintosh 4.**x**   
  - Microsoft Word for the Macintosh 5.**x**   
  - Microsoft Word 6.0 Binary Documents and Templates    
  - Microsoft Word 95 Binary Documents and Templates    
   
- You are using Word 2007, and you try to open a file that was saved in one of the following earlier Word formats. (Word 2007 does not support documents that were saved in the following Word formats.)

  - Microsoft Word for Windows 2.**x**   
  - Microsoft Word for the Macintosh 4.**x**

- An administrator restricted the kinds of documents that you can open or save in Word 2007 or in Word 2003. An administrator can set a registry key to restrict this functionality. 

  For Word 2007, the registry key can be set in the 2007 Office System Administrative Templates. For more information, see the "Word 2007" subsection of the "More Information" section.

  For Word 2003, security update 934181 enables the administrator to block the ability to save or to open files in Word 2003. For more information, see the "Word 2003" subsection of the "More Information" section.
