# The Save As dialog box appears two times when you try to save a file in Word

When you select **Save** or **Save As**  to save a file in Microsoft Word, the **Save As**  dialog box appears two times.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the Normal.dotm template is corrupted.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, create a new Normal.dotm file by changing the name of the old file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Windows Explorer, type *%appdata%\Microsoft\Templates* in the address bar, and then select **Enter**.
