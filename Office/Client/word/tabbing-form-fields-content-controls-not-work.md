# Tabbing between form fields and content controls does not work correctly in Word

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

##  Symptoms

Consider the following scenario. In Microsoft Word, you combine form fields (Legacy Tools) and content controls in the same document. Then, you enable theÂ **Filling in forms** editing restriction. In this scenario, you cannot use the TAB key to move freely between the form fields and the content controls. You can tab from a form field to a content control. However, you cannot tab from a content control to a form field. Therefore, when you reach the first content control, you can only move between the content controls.

##  Cause

This issue occurs because the form fields and the content controls cannot work together.

##  Workaround

To work around this issue, use content controls only.

##  Status

This behavior is by design.
