# How to work with toolbars and toolbar buttons: add, create, edit, delete, restore, and more in Word

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

One of the most convenient features of Microsoft Word is the ability to customize the tools that you work with. This article describes how you can customize and create toolbars and toolbar buttons. You can customize any toolbar by adding, deleting, moving, or grouping toolbar buttons to suit your needs.

Microsoft Word includes several built-in toolbars, including the two default toolbars that are visible when you start Word: the Standard toolbar and the **Formatting** toolbar. The Standard toolbar includes command buttons with which you can quickly access many of the frequently used commands, such as **Save**, **Open**, **Copy**, and **Paste**. The **Formatting** toolbar provides quick access to text-formatting commands, including **Bold**, **Italic**, **Underline**, **Numbering**, and **Bullets**.

To see a list of available toolbars, point to **Toolbars** on the **View** menu. The available toolbars appear on the **Toolbars** submenu. The toolbars that are currently visible in the Word window are selected (check marks appear next to them). To view and use a toolbar, you must select it on the **Toolbars** submenu. To select it (make it visible on the Word screen), click the toolbar name.

Note Creating and customizing menus in Word is similar to the way that you create and customize your toolbars.

### How to add a button to an existing toolbar
 
To add a button to an existing toolbar, use one of the following methods. 

#### Method 1: Use the customize command on the toolbars submenu

1. On the **View** menu, point to **Toolbars**, and then click **Customize**.

    **Note** You can also open the **Customize** dialog box by clicking **Customize** on the **Tools** menu.   
2. In the **Customize** dialog box, click the **Commands** tab. Under **Categories**, select the category from which you want to add a button. The **Categories** list displays categories of commands, organized by menu name or by type. The **Built-in Menus** category provides options for changing menus.   
3. Click a category to change the list of commands that appear in the **Commands** box, on the right side of the **Customize** dialog box.   
4. To add a button to a toolbar that is displayed, drag the button from the **Commands** box to the toolbar.

    For example, under **Categories**, click **View**. In the **Commands** box, click **View Field Codes**, and drag it to the Standard toolbar. Release the mouse button when you see a vertical bar indicating the position of the button.   

#### Method 2: Use the "More Buttons" button on the toolbar

1. On the toolbar, click **More Buttons**, and then click **Add or Remove Buttons**. 

    A submenu appears.

    **Note** The **More Buttons** toolbar button appears on most (not all) toolbars only when the toolbar is docked. To dock a toolbar, either double-click the title bar of the floating toolbar, or drag it to a docked position. 

    For more information about how to dock a toolbar, click **Microsoft Word Help** on the **Help** menu, type move a toolbar in the Office Assistant or the Answer Wizard, and then click **Search** to view the topics returned.
