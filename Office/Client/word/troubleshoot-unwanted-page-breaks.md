# Troubleshooting guide for unwanted page breaks

[!INCLUDE [Branding name note](../../../includes/branding-name-note.md)]

## Summary

This article describes how to troubleshoot page breaks that occur in a Word document at unexpected or unwanted locations.

> [!NOTE]
> It is easier to view page breaks in normal view than print layout view. To switch to normal view, in Word 2000, Word 2002 and Word 2003, on the Viewmenu, click Normal. In Word 2007, Word 2010 and Word 2013, click the View tab and then click Draft.

## More Information

### Check spacing before or after the paragraph

#### Word 2000, Word 2002, and Word 2003

1. Select the paragraph immediately before or after the unwanted page break.   
2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.   
3. Click the Indents and Spacing tab, and then check to see whether Spacing Before or Spacing After is set to an unusually high value.   

#### Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013

1. Select the paragraph immediately before or after the unwanted page break.   
2. On the Page Layout tab, click the Paragraph Dialog Box Launcher, and then click the Indents and Spacing tab. Or, right-click and choose Paragraph, and then click the Indents and Spacing tab.   
3. Check to see whether Spacing Before or Spacing After is set to an unusually high value.   

### Check the pagination options of the preceding paragraph

#### Word 2000, Word 2002, and Word 2003

1. Select the first paragraph on the page following the unwanted page break.   
2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.   
3. Click the Line and Page Breaks tab.   
4. Check to see whether one of the following three pagination options is selected:

    - Page break before: Inserts a page break before a paragraph.   
    - Keep with next: Prevents a page break between the current and following paragraphs.
    - Keep lines together: Prevents a page break within a paragraph.   

#### Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013

1. Select the first paragraph on the page following the unwanted page break.   
2. On the Page Layout tab, click the Paragraph dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group.   
3. Click the Line and Page Breaks tab.   
4. Check to see whether one of the following three pagination options is selected:   

    - Page break before: Inserts a page break before a paragraph.   
    - Keep with next: Prevents a page break between the current and following paragraphs.
    - Keep lines together: Prevents a page break within a paragraph.   

### Check the "From edge" setting

#### Word 2000, Word 2002, and Word 2003

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup, and then click to select the Margins tab.   
2. Look at the From edge setting for the Header or Footer to see whether it is too large.   

#### Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013

1. On the Page Layout tab, click the Page Setup dialog box launcher in the Page Setup group.   
2. Click the Layout tab.   
3. Look at the From edge setting for the Header or Footer to see whether it is too large.   

> [!NOTE]
> This setting determines the distance from the edge of the page where Word starts printing the text of a header or footer. The default setting is 0.5 inch. A larger setting decreases the available print area for your document. 

### Check to see whether the text that follows the page break is in a table

Word includes an option that does not allow a page break to be inserted in a table cell. As a result, if the entire cell does not fit on the page, Word pushes the entire cell to the next page.

To change this option, follow these steps.

#### Word 2000, Word 2002, and Word 2003

1. Place the insertion point in the table.   
2. On the Table menu, click Table Properties.   
3. Click the Row tab.   
4. Click to select the **Allow row to break across pages** check box.   

This sets the page break option for the entire table.

#### Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013

1. Place the insertion point in the table.   
2. Go to the Layout tab under Table Tools.   
3. In the Table group, click Properties.   
4. Click the Row tab.   
5. Click to select the **Allow row to break across pages** check box.   
This sets the page break option for the entire table.

### Search for manual (or "hard") page breaks

You may have inserted a manual page break by pressing CTRL+ENTER. Or, you may have inserted a manual page break by using one of the following methods, depending on your version of Word. 

#### Word 2002, Word 2002, or Word 2003

1. On the Insert menu, click Break.   
2. Select Page break, and then click OK.   

#### Word 2007, Word 2010, and Word 2013

On the Insert tab, click Page Breaks on the Pages group.

You can use the Replace command to remove manual page breaks by searching for manual page breaks.

**Note** Do not click the Replace All button when you remove manual page breaks unless your document contains no section breaks.

### Check for unexpected page breaks following "Normal" style text

If a series of Heading styles is used in a document (an outline, for example) followed by text that is formatted with the Normal style, an unexpected page break may occur following the Normal text. This problem occurs only in normal view and does not occur in outline view. Use one of the following methods to remove individual occurrences of an unwanted page break. 

#### Method 1: Apply the "Keep with Next" option to Normal text

#### Method 2: Clear the "Keep with next" option from the heading

##### Word 2000, Word 2002, and Word 2003

1. Select the Heading text that precedes the Normal text.   
2. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.
