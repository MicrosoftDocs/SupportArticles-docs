## Cause

This issue occurs because Excel Online doesn't support text queries. 

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, use one of the following workarounds:

### Method 1: Create a copy of the workbook in Excel Online to remove the unsupported feature

1. Select **Edit Workbook** > **Edit in Excel Online** in the workbook.
1. In the prompt dialog box, select **Edit a Copy**.

A copied workbook that doesn't contain any unsupported features will be created through this method. It will be saved to the same directory as the original workbook.

1. Clear the **Save query definition** check box in the **External Data Range Properties** dialog box.
