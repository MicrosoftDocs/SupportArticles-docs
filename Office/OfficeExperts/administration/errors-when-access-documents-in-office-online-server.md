# Errors when you access documents in Office Online Server

This article was written by [Taylor Hempel](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Taylor+H+-+MSFT), Premier Field Engineer.

## Symptoms

When you preview, view, or edit documents in Microsoft Microsoft Offices Online 2013 or Office Online Server from SharePoint web applications where **Forms-Based Authentication (FBA)** is enabled, you receive various error messages.

## Cause

By default, Microsoft Offices Online 2013 and Office Online Server connect back to the default zone of any given web application.

If you have **Forms-Based Authentication** configured for the extended zone, but not for the default zone, the **Security Token Service(STS)** in SharePoint won't validate the Access Token that's presented by Microsoft Offices Online or Office Online Server to access document contents.

## Resolution

To fix these errors, configure **Forms-Based Authentication** for the default zone of any web application where Microsoft Offices Online 2013 or Office Online Server is being used in the farm.
