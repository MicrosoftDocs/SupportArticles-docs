# "The workbook must be checked out before it can be replaced. You can save this file with another name." when you run a scheduled data refresh on a PowerPivot workbook

This article was written by [Rick Andring](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Rick+A.+-+MSFT), Support Escalation Engineer.

## Symptoms

When you run a scheduled data refresh on a PowerPivot workbook, you receive the following error:

> The workbook must be checked out before it can be replaced. You can save this file with another name.

## Cause

The **Require documents to be check out before they can be edited** option under **Versioning Settings** in **Document Library Settings** is likely set to **Yes**.

## Resolution

PowerPivot doesn't check out documents when it makes its modification. To make the scheduled data refresh to work on the document library, set the **Require documents to be check out before they can be edited** option to **No**.
