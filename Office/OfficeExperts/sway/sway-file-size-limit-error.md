# File size limit error when you upload files to Sway

This article was written by [Zakir Haveliwala](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Zakir+H+-+MSFT), Senior Support Escalation Engineer.

Microsoft Sway has file size limits for different types of files. The maximum supported file sizes are 20 MB for documents, 100 MB for audio files, and 256 MB for other types of content.

If you upload a file that exceeds the size to Sway, you may receive an error message that states that the file is too large to upload.

You cannot change these file size limits. If you experience the error message, we recommend that you go to the following site:

[Sway Suggestion Box](https://sway.uservoice.com/)

In this site, you can make suggestions by using the **Sway Suggestion Box** that the product group can consider for improving the product and adding features. Include the description of the types of files that you try to upload and the size of the files. This information will help the product group determine what limits better meet customer needs.
