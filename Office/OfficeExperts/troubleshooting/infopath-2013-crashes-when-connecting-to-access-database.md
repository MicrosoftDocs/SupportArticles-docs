# InfoPath 2013 crashes when you connect to an Access database

## Symptoms

Assume that you have a Microsoft InfoPath form that connects to an Access database. After you move to Office 2016 and Access 2016 is installed, InfoPath 2013 crashes when you connect to the Access database.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, do the following steps:

1. Install the Windows Installer version of Office 2013 or Click to Run (C2R) version of Office 2016.
1. Run the Access application before you use the InfoPath form.
