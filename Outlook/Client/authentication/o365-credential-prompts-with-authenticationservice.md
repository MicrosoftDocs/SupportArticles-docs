# Microsoft 365 credential prompts with AuthenticationService registry value

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2975918

## Symptoms

When attempting to create an Outlook profile or connect to a Microsoft 365 mailbox, you are continually prompted for credentials while the client displays **trying to connect...** If you cancel the credentials prompt, you receive this error:

> The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action.

Under **More Settings** on the **Microsoft Exchange Security** tab, the dropdown for **Logon network security** displays a value other than Anonymous Authentication, and is disabled.

## Cause

This behavior can occur if the `AuthenticationService` registry value is configured. This registry value will be found in this location:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Outlook\Security`  
DWORD: `AuthenticationService`  
Available values: **9**, **16**, or **10**

Where x.0 = 15.0 for Outlook 2013, and x.0 = 14.0 for Outlook 2010, and 12.0 for Outlook 2007.

## Resolution

Remove the `AuthenticationService` registry value, or disable the Group Policy that is applying it.

> [!WARNING]
> Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Exit Outlook.
2. Start Registry Editor.

    In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1

    Swipe in from the right to open the charms, tap or select **Search**, and then type *regedit.exe* in the search box. Or, type *regedit.exe* at the **Start** screen, and then tap or select regedit in the search results.

    In Windows Vista and Windows 7

    Select **Start**, type *regedit* in the **Start** search box, and then press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or select **Allow**.

3. Navigate to the appropriate path from the Cause section above.

4. Right-click `AuthenticationService`, select **Modify**, and select **Delete** to remove it from the registry.

The following Group Policy applies the `AuthenticationService` registry value:

:::image type="content" source="media/o365-credential-prompts-with-authenticationservice/group-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Authentication with Exchange Server group policy." border="false":::

Policy: Account Settings\Exchange\Authentication with Exchange Server

Setting: Select the authentication with Exchange server.

Available choices:  
Kerberos/NTLM Password Authentication (Default)  
Kerberos Password Authentication  
NTLM Password Authentication

To disable the Group Policy, under Authentication with Exchange Server, select **Not Configured**.
