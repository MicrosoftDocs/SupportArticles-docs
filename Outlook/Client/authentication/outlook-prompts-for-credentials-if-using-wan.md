# Outlook users are prompted for credentials when they switch from a LAN to a WAN

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2784787

## Symptoms

Assume that domain users connect to Microsoft Exchange Server by using Outlook. The Outlook Anywhere feature is enabled in their Outlook profiles. When the domain users switch from using the LAN to using a WAN, they are prompted for credentials by Outlook.

## Cause

This issue occurs when the client authentication method of Outlook Anywhere is set to Basic Authentication on the Exchange server.

When the user switches to another network, Outlook may change the connection type from TCP to HTTPS. If the client authentication method of Outlook Anywhere is set to Basic Authentication, the user is prompted for credentials.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, set the client authentication method of Outlook Anywhere to NTLM Authentication on the Exchange server.
