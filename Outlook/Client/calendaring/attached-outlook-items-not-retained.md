# Attached Outlook items not retained in Microsoft 365 Group Calendar meeting or appointment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4499943

## Symptoms

When you use Outlook for Microsoft 365, Outlook 2019, or Outlook 2016 to attach an Outlook item to a Microsoft 365 Modern Group Calendar appointment or meeting, the attachment isn't retained.

## Cause

This issue occurs when using the **Outlook Item** button on the **Insert** tab of the ribbon. This is a known limitation in Outlook with Microsoft 365 group calendars.

## Workaround

Copy and paste the contents of the wanted Outlook item into the body of the meeting or appointment. Alternatively, you can upload the Outlook item to **Files** in the Microsoft 365 group or to OneDrive for Business and then include a link in the body of the meeting or appointment.
