# Information about the Calendar Checking Tool for Outlook (CalCheck)

The Calendar Checking Tool for Outlook (CalCheck) is a command-line program that checks the Microsoft Outlook calendar for problems. The tool opens an Outlook messaging profile to access the Outlook calendar. It performs various checks on general settings, such as permissions, free/busy publishing, delegate configuration, and automatic booking. Then, each item in the Outlook calendar folder is checked for known problems that can cause unexpected behavior, such as meetings that seem to be missing.

The CalCheck tool then generates a report that can be used to help diagnose problem items or identify trends.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CalCheck reports include the following fields for meetings or appointments that are determined to be problematic:
>
> - Subject
> - Location
> - Start Time
> - End Time
> - Organize

Because these calendar item fields may contain personal information or details, we recommend that you first review all items in the CalCheck report before you share your report. See the [More information](#more-information) section for additional fields that are found in CalCheck reports.

## Perform calendar checking

To use CalCheck, the Outlook calendar must reside on a computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server. The tool doesn't work with IMAP, POP3, or other non-Exchange email accounts.

### Method 1: Use the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

The Assistant fully automates all the steps required to perform Outlook calendar checking and is available in two versions. Use the version that suits your requirements.

- The Enterprise (command-line) version

  The [Enterprise version of the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersion) is a command line version that can be scripted, and is recommended to perform Outlook calender checking on multiple devices and devices that you can't access immediately.
  
  > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
  > [Download the Enterprise version](https://aka.ms/SaRA_EnterpriseVersionFiles)
  
- The UI version

  The [UI version of the Assistant](https://aka.ms/SaRA_Home) is recommended if you need to perform Outlook calender checking on a single device, or on a small number of individual devices.
  
  > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
  > [Download the UI version](https://aka.ms/sara-calcheck)

### Method 2: Manual installation

Go to the [latest release](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=28786), download and install the Calendar Checking Tool for Outlook.

> [!NOTE]
> The 64-bit version of this tool is for use together with only the 64-bit version of Microsoft Outlook.

## Checks that are performed

The Calendar Checking Tool performs two basic kinds of checks: Calendar-specific checks and item-level checks.

### Calendar-specific checks

The following calendar-specific checks are run and then logged in the report:

- Permissions on the calendar.
- The total number of items in the calendar folder.  

    For more information about high item counts in the Calendar folder, see [Outlook performance issues when there are too many items or folders in a cached mode .ost or .pst file](/outlook/troubleshoot/performance/performance-issues-if-too-many-items-or-folders).

- Delegates on the calendar.
- Free/busy publishing information.
- Direct Booking settings for the mailbox or calendar.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The information for these three checks is read from the Local free/busy message. In rare cases, Outlook may be unable to open that message. In that case, these checks fail. You should force the regeneration of the hidden free/busy information in the Exchange mailbox only if this occurs.  

    For more information about how to regenerate the hidden free/busy information, see [You experience issues in Outlook when you try to configure free/busy information or when you try to delegate information](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/you-experience-issues-in-outlook-when-you-try-to-configure-free-busy-information-or-when-you-try-to-delegate-information-7167b76e-5a56-1a94-08b7-41186c873d9b).

### Item-level checks

The following item-level checks are run and then logged in the report.

|Error number |Issue |Solution |
|----------|-----------|------------|
|0001|The Items Recurrence Start Date or Time is set to 0 (year 1601).|If you're the organizer, you should change the Calendar folder view to a table view, find the appointment or meeting, and then cancel and re-create it.

|0002|The Items Recurrence Start Date or Time is earlier than January 1 1995.|This isn't necessarily an error condition. You should delete or cancel the item only if it seems to be corrupted. By default, these items aren't moved when you use the -f argument.

## Current help and command-line switches

This section describes the command-line switches that are available to customize CalCheck behavior.

### Usages

You can edit the _CalCheck.cfg_ file to turn specific tests on or off.

*CalCheck [-P \<profilename>] [-O \<path>] [-C \<Version>] [-A] [-F] [-R] [-V]*

_CalCheck -?_
  
- **P** \<Profile name> (if absent, prompts for profile)
- **O** \<Output Path> (path to put output files; the default path is the current directory)
- **C** \<Version> (load a specific MAPI version for the Click-to-Run version of Office 2016 or 2013)
- **A** All calendar items output to CALITEMS.CSV
- **F** Create CalCheck folder and move flagged error items there
- **R** Put a **Report** message into the **Inbox** together with the CalCheck.csv file
- **V** Verbose output to the command window
- **?** Print this message

Running the command creates CalCheck.log and CalCheckErr.csv files that show potential problems and items to fix or remove, plus processing information.  

### Examples

- Default - Prompt for a profile, and process the mailbox in that profile:  
    _CalCheck_

- Process just the mailbox in "MyProfile":  
    _CalCheck -P MyProfile_
- Process a mailbox and move error items to the **CalCheck** folder in the mailbox, and place a report message in the **Inbox**:  
    _CalCheck -F -R_
- Process a mailbox based on a specific profile and version of MAPI for Click-to-Run versions of Office:  
    *CalCheck -C \<Outlook version - like 2010, 2013, etc.> -P MyProfile*
- Print this message:  
    _CalCheck -?_

### Configuration file in CalCheck version 2

CalCheck version 2 (v2) now includes a _CalCheck.cfg_ file. This file is located in the same folder in which CalCheck.exe is located. If the `.cfg` file is missing, CalCheck v2 displays an error message and doesn't run. The `.cfg` file is in plain text format. You can manually edit the file to enable or disable individual tests. By default, all tests are set to **true**. By default, all tests are run.

## More information

CalCheck reports also contain the following fields from calendar meetings and appointments that are determined to be problematic.
