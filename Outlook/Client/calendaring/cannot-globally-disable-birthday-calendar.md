# Can't globally enable or disable the birthday calendar

## Symptoms

You want to globally enable or disable the birthday calendar in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook on the web for all users in your Exchange Online organization. However, you don't see a tenant-level setting to do this.

## Cause

Currently, it's not possible to enable or disable the birthday calendar at the tenant level.

## Workaround

Ask each user to [enable or disable the birthday calendar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-a-birthday-calendar-and-reminder-in-outlook-b8e636da-fda8-413f-940e-68396efa49a6) in their Outlook client or by using Outlook on the web.

> [!NOTE]
> Birthday calendars for Exchange Online mailboxes are enabled by default.
