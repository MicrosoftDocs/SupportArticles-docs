# You can't send a response to a meeting request in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3185258

## Symptoms

When you try to send a response to a meeting request in Microsoft Outlook, the option is not available. The **Accept**, **Tentative**, and **Decline** buttons do not triggers the expected drop-down options of **Edit the response before sending**, **Send the response now**, and **Do not send a response**.

Because you can't send a response, the meeting organizer doesn't receive one from you, and the meeting tracking feature is not updated as expected.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the meeting organizer added you as a resource to the meeting and you are external to the meeting organizers domain.

## Resolution

To work around this behavior, ask the meeting organizer to add you as a required or optional attendee instead of as a resource.
