# Error when you view free/busy information in Outlook: We're checking everyone's calendars

## Symptoms

When you view free/busy information in the **Scheduling Assistant** in Outlook, you receive the following error message:

> "We're checking everyone's calendars"

## Cause

The **FreeBusySupport** registry value could be missing after you install or reinstall Office applications. To verify that this is your situation, start Registry Editor (right-click **Start**, type **regedit** in the **Run** box, select **OK**), and then locate the following registry subkeys, depending on the type of your Office installation.

**For Click-to-Run installations**:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\SchedulingInformation\FreeBusySupport`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\SchedulingInformation\FreeBusySupport`

**For Windows Installer (MSI) installations**:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\SchedulingInformation\FreeBusySupport`

> [!NOTE]
> The "16.0" path segment represents Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, and Outlook for Microsoft 365.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) for restoration in case problems occur.
