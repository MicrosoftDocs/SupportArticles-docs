## Cause

This issue occurs when the following conditions are true:

- You are using the Block all unmanaged add-ins (Outlook) Group Policy setting to manage the list of enabled add-ins.
- **Lync 2013** or **Lync 2010** is one of the enabled add-ins in the list of managed add-ins.
- **Microsoft VBA for Outlook** is not on the list of enabled add-ins in the list of managed add-ins.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, add the `ProgID` (`Microsoft.VBAAddinForOutlook.1`) for the Microsoft VBA for Outlook add-in to the enabled add-in list of managed add-ins through the Group Policy Editor.

To update an existing policy that's configured to manage add-ins for Outlook, follow these steps:

1. Start the Group Policy Editor.
2. Under **User Configuration**, expand **Administrative Templates** to locate the policy node for your template. When you use the Outlk15.admx template, this node is named Microsoft Outlook 2013.
3. Under **Miscellaneous**, double-click **List of managed add-ins**.

4. Under **Options**, select **Show**.
