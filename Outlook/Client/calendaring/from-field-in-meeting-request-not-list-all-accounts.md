# The From field in a meeting request does not list all accounts in Microsoft Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 978809

## Symptoms

When you open a meeting request in Microsoft Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013, Outlook 2016 or Outlook for Microsoft 365, the **From** field does not list all accounts. Therefore, you may be unable to switch to the account that you want to send the meeting request from.

## Workaround

To send a meeting request from the correct account, close the meeting request. Then, switch to the calendar for your intended account before you create a new meeting request.
