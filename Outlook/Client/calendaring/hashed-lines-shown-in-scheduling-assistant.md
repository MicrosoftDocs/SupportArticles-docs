# Hashed lines shown in scheduling assistant when Exchange Server 2016 tries to retrieve free/busy information across untrusted forests

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4456243

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You deploy Exchange Server 2016 in a cross-forest topology.
- You [configure availability service in untrusted forest](/exchange/architecture/client-access/availability-service-for-cross-forest-topologies#use-the-exchange-management-shell-to-configure-organization-wide-freebusy-information-in-an-untrusted-cross-forest-topology) to share free/busy information.
- You use the Scheduling Assistant feature to view the free/busy information about another forest mailbox in Outlook.

In this scenario, you could only see "\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the free/busy information. In addition, the Outlook on the web (previously known as Outlook Web App) client is also affected.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Exchange Server doesn't send the `AvailabilityAddressSpace` authentication header. Therefore, a "The request failed with HTTP status 401: Unauthorized" error message occurs.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, install [Cumulative Update 11](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4134118) for Exchange Server 2016 or [a later cumulative update](/Exchange/new-features/build-numbers-and-release-dates) for Exchange Server 2016.
