### Open a shared calendar in Outlook Web App

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to share an Outlook calendar to other people rather than open a shared calendar from others in Outlook Web App, please check [Sharing your calendar in Outlook Web App](https://support.microsoft.com/office/share-your-calendar-in-outlook-on-the-web-7ecef8ae-139c-40d9-bae2-a23977ee58d5).

To open a shared calendar from the sharing invitation, select **Accept** to open the shared calendar, and then you will see the shared calendar on the left pane under **Other Calendar** and the events on the right pane.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/open-shared-calendar-in-owa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the OWA Shared Calendar Invitation window.":::

**If you see something different, what problem do you encounter?**

- [There is no Accept option](#there-is-no-accept-option)
- [You see nothing when you open the shared calendar](#you-see-nothing-or-you-dont-have-the-necessary-permission-to-open-the-shared-calendar)
- [You don't have the necessary permission to view a shared calendar](#you-see-nothing-or-you-dont-have-the-necessary-permission-to-open-the-shared-calendar)

### There is no Accept option

To work around this problem, open directly into the shared calendar.

For example, assume that your Outlook on the Web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) URL is `https://yourdomain/owa`, and that a user (user@*yourdomain*.com) shared calendar with you.

You can use the following URL to open the user's calendar:

`https://yourdomain/owa/user@yourdomain.com/?cmd=contents&module=calendar`

**Did this solve your problem?**

- If yes, see [Additional resources.](#additional-resources)
- If no, see [Additional help.](#additional-help)

### There is no Open this Calendar option

This problem occurs when the person who shared the calendar with you is running a later version of Outlook.

In the invitation, notice whether **Microsoft Exchange** appears before the shared calendar name, as in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/microsoft-exchange-shows-before-shared-calendar-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a shared calendar content with Microsoft Exchange showing before the shared calendar name.":::

#### If Microsoft Exchange appears before the shared calendar name

If **Microsoft Exchange** appears before the shared calendar name, this typically indicates that the shared calendar is an Outlook default calendar. To open it, follow these steps:

1. On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then select **Other User's Folder**.


2. In the **Open Other User's Folder** dialog box, type the name of the user who shares the calendar with you in the **Name** box. In the **Folder type** box, select the type of shared calendar, and then select **OK**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/other-users-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Open Other User's Folder window.":::

#### If Microsoft Exchange does not appear before the shared calendar name

If **Microsoft Exchange** does not appear before the shared calendar name, this typically indicates that the shared calendar is not an Outlook default calendar. In this situation, first add the user's Exchange mailbox to your Outlook profile.

1. In Outlook, select **Account Settings** on the **Tools** menu.

2. In the **E-mail Accounts** dialog box, select the **E-mail** tab, select your Exchange Server account, and then select **Change**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/change-option-on-email-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Change option on the E-mail tab.":::

3. Select **More Settings**.

4. In the **Microsoft Exchange** dialog box, select the **Advanced** tab, and then select **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/advanced-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Advanced tab and the Add option selected on the Microsoft Exchange dialog box.":::

5. In the **Add Mailbox** dialog box, type the name of the person who shares the calendar with you, and then select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/add-mailbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add Mailbox window.":::

6. Select **OK** > **Next** > **Finish** > **Close**.

7. On the navigation pane, expand **Mailbox - UserNameOfFolderOwner**, and then select the calendar that the user shared with you.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/expand-mailbox.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the target user's mailbox selected.":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you cannot expand the mailbox, see the [Cannot expand the mailbox of another person](#cannot-expand-the-mailbox-of-another-person) section of this guide for the workaround.

### Workaround for opening shared calendar on Mobile/Tablet devices

If you are using Outlook App on mobile or tablet devices, such as Windows Phone, iPhone, iPad, Android Phones, you cannot see other user's calendars on these devices as they only sync your own calendars. The workaround is that you need to use Outlook on the web or Outlook Web App to view the shared calendar, or view it when on a Desktop Outlook for Windows or Mac client.

To use Outlook on the web or Outlook Web App to open the shared calendar from an invitation, sign in with your exchange or Microsoft 365 account, you will see the share invitation like this:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/open-shared-calendar-in-owa.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a shared calendar invitation in Outlook Web App.":::

Select **Accept** to open the shared calendar, and then you will see the shared calendar listed on the left pane under **Other Calendars** and the events on this calendar on the right pane.

### Outlook 2016 stops responding when you try to open shared calendar

1. Tap Windows key, search **Control Panel** and open it.
2. Select **Programs** > **Program and Features**.
3. Check the list to find the older Outlook version, right-click on it and choose **Uninstall** to remove it.
4. Reboot your computer and restart Outlook 2016.

### General troubleshooting for other errors when open shared calendar in Outlook 2013

If you get other errors, try the following instruction for general troubleshooting:

1. Ensure the user has shared the calendar with you, with proper permissions. You can check [Share an Outlook calendar with other people](https://support.office.com/article/Share-an-Outlook-calendar-with-other-people-353ed2c1-3ec5-449d-8c73-6931a0adab88) to get instructions about how to share calendar and grant proper permission.

2. Check the right bottom corner in Outlook to see if the status looks like below to make sure Outlook is connected to the network and able to receive mail successfully, and isn't too busy performing other tasks such as updating folders.

    If you see :::image type="icon" source="./media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/connected-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the message that says Connected to: Microsoft Exchange.":::, it indicates that the Outlook 2013 is connected to the network and Exchange server successfully.
    If you see :::image type="icon" source="./media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/disconnected-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the message that says disconnected.":::, it indicates that the Outlook 2013 isn't connected to the network or Exchange server, check your network cable connection or contact your Network Admin.

3. Try again later to see if the shared calendar works.

### You don't have permission to view a shared calendar in Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011

When you try to open a shared Calendar folder in Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011, you receive the following error message even though you were granted permission to the folder:

> Outlook cannot open the folder. You do not have permission to open this folder. Contact\<Calendar owner's name> for permission.

This issue occurs because the owner of the folder that you want to access shares the sub calendar folder with you but does not share their default (primary) Calendar folder. To fix this issue, the calendar owner must share both the primary and the secondary Calendar folders with you. For more information, see ["You do not have permission" error message when you try to open a shared Calendar folder in Outlook for Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2743752).

**Did this solve your problem?**

- If yes, see [Additional resources.](#additional-resources)
- If no, see [Additional help.](#additional-help)

### You get blank calendar or permission error on Mac even if you have free/busy permission in Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011

A user grants you Free/Busy permission to their calendar, but when you try to open that user's calendar in Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011, you receive the following error message:

> Outlook cannot open the folder. You do not have permission to open this folder. Contact \<user_name> for permission.

This issue occurred because the Free/Busy feature is only available in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 for Windows. To open a shared calendar in Outlook for Mac, the user must grant you permissions of **Reviewer** or higher. Or, you can view the user's Free/Busy information by creating a new meeting request and then adding that user in the Scheduling Assistant. For more information, see [User with Free/Busy permission can't open another calendar in Outlook for Mac](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2876443).

### Can't open one or more of the shared Calendar folders in Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011

In Outlook 2016 for Mac and Outlook for Mac 2011, you cannot open a shared Calendar folder that is not a subcalendar of the user's shared default Calendar folder.

- Calendar
- Second Calendar
- Third Calendar

  :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-open-shared-calendar/third-calendar.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Third calendar tab selected.":::

In this example, the **Second Calendar** folder is a subcalendar of the user's shared default **Calendar** folder. Therefore, you can open the **Second Calendar** folder in Outlook for Mac. However, the **Third Calendar** folder is not a subcalendar under the default **Calendar** folder. Therefore, you cannot open this folder in Outlook for Mac. To resolve this issue, have the calendar owner create all shared calendars under the default **Calendar** folder.

- If no, see [Additional help.](#additional-help)
