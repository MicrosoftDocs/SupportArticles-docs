### Create a new shared mailbox and assign permissions

To set up a common, shared calendar or contacts list that people in your organization can access and edit, you simply need to create a shared mailbox. After you create the shared mailbox, users that are members of the shared mailbox will be able to access the shared calendar and contacts.

> [!NOTE]
> Because, creating a mailbox to be used for shared calendar or contacts list involves creating a shared mailbox, the people that can access the shared calendar or contacts list can also access and respond to email sent to the shared mailbox.

Before you begin, sign in to the Microsoft 365 portal, and then select **Admin** in the top navigation.

1. Go to **Admin** > **Users & Groups**.
2. On the **Users & Groups page**, select **Shared Mailboxes**, and then select **Add**![Add icon](./media/how-to-share-calendar-and-contacts/add-icon.png).

   - **Mailbox name**: This name appears in the address book, on the To field in email, and in the list of shared mailboxes on the Shared Mailboxes page. It's required and should be user-friendly so people recognize what it is.
   - **Email address**: Enter the email address for the shared mailbox. It's required.
4. Select **Next**.
5. On the **Add members** page, select **Add**![Add icon](./media/how-to-share-calendar-and-contacts/add-icon.png).

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a security group that contains the people that you want to be able to access the shared calendar or contacts, you can skip to this section.

> [!NOTE]
> If new users are created in your organization, who need access to this shared calendar or contact, you'll need to add them to the security group.

##### Step 2: Assign the security group Full Access permission to the shared mailbox
