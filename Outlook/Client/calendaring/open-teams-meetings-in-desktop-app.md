# Configure Teams meeting links to open in Teams desktop app

When you select a Microsoft Teams meeting link in Microsoft Outlook to join a meeting, Outlook opens a page in your browser that provides multiple options to join the meeting. If you have the Teams desktop app installed on your computer, and you want to use the app to join all Teams meetings, you can set your meeting preference so that Outlook opens the meeting directly in the Teams app instead of asking for your preference each time.

## Set your Teams meeting preference in the browser

1. Select the **Join Online** button in the Microsoft Outlook meeting reminder or select **Click here to join the meeting** in your email invitation.

2. On the Teams start page that opens in your browser, select **Always allow teams.microsoft.com to open links of this type in the associated app**, and then select **Open**.

The browser will store your preference and open the meeting in your Teams desktop app. For all future Teams meetings, Outlook will send your meeting join request to the Teams desktop app when you select the meeting link.

## Set your Teams meeting preference in the Windows registry

Use this method if you can't set your Teams meeting preference in the browser, or if you want to set the preference on behalf of your users.

[!INCLUDE [Important registry alert](../../../includes/registry-important-alert.md)]

1. Create a text file that's named *teams-desktop.reg*.

2. Copy and paste the following text into the file:

   ```notepad
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Teams]

   "currentTeamsDeepLinkUrlProtocolVersion"="1.0.0.0"

   "minStableTeamsDeepLinkUrlProtocolVersion"="1.0.0.0"
   ```

3. Save the *teams-desktop.reg* file.

4. Double-click *teams-desktop.reg* to run it.

5. When you are prompted for your approval, select **Yes**.

If you have to set the meeting preference for a specific user, replace the second line in *teams-desktop.reg* with the following registry subkey: `[HKEY_USERS\<user SSID>\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Teams]`

The Windows registry will store your preference. For all future Teams meetings, Outlook will send your meeting join request to the Teams desktop app when you select the meeting link.
