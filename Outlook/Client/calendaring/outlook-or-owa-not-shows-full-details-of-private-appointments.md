# Outlook or OWA doesn't display full details of private appointments on shared calendars

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4021947

## Symptom

Microsoft Outlook or the Outlook Web App (OWA) doesn't display full details of private appointments on shared calendars.

This issue occurs if you have the default permissions on a shared mailbox calendar, and it occurs even if you create the private appointment.

> [!NOTE]
> You may experience different symptoms that depend on the version of Outlook and Exchange that you are using. For example, Outlook Web App in Exchange Server 2010 doesn't display the full details, but Outlook Web App in Exchange Server 2013 does.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Grant the user full access to the target mailbox.
- Grant the user delegate access to the target mailbox and access to see private items.

## More information

This issue doesn't occur in Outlook Web App in Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, and Exchange Online (Microsoft 365). This issue may occur in some older versions of Outlook.
