# Publish to WebDAV Server option is unavailable for a calendar in Outlook 2010

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2909318

## Symptoms

After you install the October cumulative update [2825825](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2825825) for Microsoft Outlook 2010, the **Publish to WebDAV Server** option is unavailable for a calendar.

## Cause

This issue occurs if you have published the calendar to Office.com.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Do one of the following:

   - Windows 7 and Windows Vista

     - Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, click **Accessories**, and then click **Run**.
  
   - Windows XP

     - Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.

2. In the **Run** dialog box, type and run the following command:

    ```console
    C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\outlook.exe /cleansharing
    ```

    > [!WARNING]
    > This command removes all RSS, Internet Calendar, and Microsoft SharePoint subscriptions from Account Settings, but leaves all previously downloaded content on your computer. This is useful if you delete one of these subscriptions within Outlook 2010.
