# Scan Outlook calendar by using Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

You can use [Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/office/about-the-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-e90bb691-c2a7-4697-a94f-88836856c72f) to run the Outlook Calendar diagnostic to troubleshoot and fix such issues as missing meeting entries and shared calendars that can't be accessed by other users. This advanced diagnostic closely mimics the scan logic that was introduced in the [Calendar Checking Tool for Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/information-about-the-calendar-checking-tool-for-outlook-calcheck-0d2ccac8-f8dd-9289-82cc-943650e36a76) (CalCheck) to identify and report issues that involve general settings such as permissions, free/busy publishing, delegate configuration, and automatic booking. The tool also alerts you to known issues that affect the Outlook calendar folder and calendar items.

To scan an Outlook calendar that's experiencing issues, you can either download the diagnostic to the computer or select it from the list of diagnostics within Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant. Select the option that works best for you.

## Download the Outlook Calendar diagnostic

1. On the computer that's running the Outlook version that's experiencing the calendar issues, open a web browser tab, and navigate to [Advanced Diagnostics - Outlook Calendar](https://aka.ms/sara-calcheck) to access the download file.

1. Run the downloaded file, *SetupProd_CalCheck.exe*.

1. If you don't have Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant already installed on the computer, select **Install** in the window that appears, and then select **I agree** to agree to the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement and Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement).

    **Note** After Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant is installed, the calendar scan begins automatically. The scan is finished when you see **We're done collecting your Outlook configuration details**.

## Run the Outlook Calendar diagnostic from Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

1. On the computer that's running the Outlook version that's experiencing the calendar issues, start Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant.

1. Select **Advanced diagnostics** > **Next**.

1. Select **Outlook** > **Next**.

1. Select **Create a detailed scan of my Outlook Calendar to identify and resolve issues** > **Next**.

1. When you're prompted to confirm that you're using the affected computer, select **Yes** > **Next**.

   **Note** The scan is finished when you see **We're done collecting your Outlook configuration details**.
