# "Send update to attendees" prompt not displayed when updating meetings

When a meeting organizer updates a meeting, Microsoft Outlook sometimes displays the following **Send Update to Attendees** prompt.

:::image type="content" source="media/send-updates-prompt-not-displayed/send-update-prompt.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the Send Update to Attendees prompt.":::

However, if the organizer updates a meeting in any of the following scenarios, Outlook doesn't display the prompt.

## Scenario 1

Outlook doesn't display the **Send Update to Attendees** prompt if all the following conditions apply. Instead, the Exchange server automatically sends a meeting update request to the Inbox of the attendees.

- The meeting organizer has version 2305 (current channel build 16501.20000) or a later version of Outlook.

- The organizer adds or removes attendees.

- Any of the following are true:

  - No attendees respond to the meeting.

  - The organizer cancels the meeting.

  - The organizer selects **Response Options** > **Request Responses** for the meeting.

  - All the meeting attendees are group mailboxes.

  - A delegate receives a copy of the meeting message on behalf of the attendee.

  - The organizer changes meeting options that are [full updates](/office/client-developer/outlook/auxiliary/about-meeting-requests-as-informational-updates-and-full-updates#full-updates), such as the subject, start time, end time, location (including adding, removing, or changing a room), recurrence, time zone, do not forward, hide attendee list, or sensitivity labels.

  - The organizer changes [organization settings](/powershell/module/exchange/set-organizationconfig#-visiblemeetingupdateproperties) that affect meeting updates.

## Scenario 2

Outlook doesn't display the **Send Update to Attendees** prompt or send a notification to the attendees if the following conditions apply:

- The meeting organizer has version 2305 (current channel build 16501.20000) or a later version of Outlook.

- Any of the following are true:

  - The organizer doesn't change the attendees.

  - The meeting has no attendees, but the organizer books a room or resource.

  - The organizer removes all attendees.

  - The organizer removes an attendee whose delegate can respond to nonprivate meeting requests on behalf of the attendee.

  - The organizer cancels the meeting or makes some other change that doesn't update the meeting.

## Scenario 3

Outlook doesn't display the **Send Update to Attendees** prompt if all the following conditions apply. Instead, the Exchange server automatically sends a meeting update request to the Inbox of only the added or deleted attendees.

- The meeting organizer has a version of Outlook that is earlier than version 2305 (current channel build 16501.20000).

- The organizer only adds or removes attendees.

- The organizer's Outlook client has [shared calendar improvements](https://support.microsoft.com/office/calendar-sharing-in-microsoft-365-b576ecc3-0945-4d75-85f1-5efafb8a37b4) enabled.

The meeting organizer can resolve the issue in this scenario by updating their Outlook client to the latest version.
