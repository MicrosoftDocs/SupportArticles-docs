# Time zones that do not observe daylight saving time

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 982987

## Summary

Assume that you live in a region that does not observe daylight saving time (DST), but the Windows setting for that time zone *does* adjust for daylight saving time. In this situation, we recommend that you do not clear the **Automatically adjust clock for Daylight Saving Time** check box in the **Time Zone Settings** dialog box.

If you disable this daylight saving time functionality, Microsoft Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 may assign the wrong time to a Calendar event, appointment, or meeting request for recipients in other time zones that do observe daylight saving time. Instead, we recommend that you select a time zone that does not observe daylight saving time and that has the same Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset as the current time zone.

For example, assume that your current time zone is (UTC-06:00) Central Time (US and Canada). There are two time zones that do not observe daylight saving time and that have the same UTC offset (-06:00):

- (UTC-06:00) Central America
- (UTC-06:00) Saskatchewan

## More information

To change your time zone setting, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, select **Clock, Language, and Region**.
2. Select **Change the time zone**.
3. In the **Time Zone** area of the **Date and Time** dialog box, select **Change time zone**.
4. In the **Time zone** list, select a time zone that does not observe daylight saving time and has the same UTC offset as your current time zone.
5. Select **OK**.
6. Select **Apply**, and then select **OK**.
