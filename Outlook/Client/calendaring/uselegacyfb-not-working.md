# The UseLegacyFB registry value does not work as expected in Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 982698

## Symptoms

If you add the `UseLegacyFB` registry value to the Windows registry to try to force Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 to behave like Office Outlook 2007, the value is ignored by Outlook.

## Cause

The `UseLegacyFB` registry value is not used by Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013. By default, if your mailbox is located on a Microsoft Exchange 2007 or Exchange 2010 server, Outlook 2007, Outlook 2010, and Outlook 2013 use the Exchange Availability Service to locate free/busy information. This is a change from Outlook 2003 and earlier versions of Outlook that use public folder free/busy information.

> [!NOTE]
> Public folder free/busy was removed from Outlook 2013. For more information about changes in Outlook 2013, see [Changes in Office 2013](/previous-versions/office/office-2013-resource-kit/cc178954(v=office.15)).

In Office Outlook 2007, you can use the following registry data to force Outlook 2007 to use public folder free/busy information instead of the Availability Service.

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Options\Calendar`  
Name: UseLegacyFB

Type: DWORD  
Value: 1

In some scenarios where you are troubleshooting Availability Service problems, you might want to force Outlook 2007 to use public folder free/busy information by adding this registry data to the client. In these same situations, you cannot force Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 to use public folder free/busy information because the `UseLegacyFB` registry value is ignored.

## Resolution

If you are troubleshooting Availability Service issues in Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013, you can enable Availability Service logging. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Outlook.
2. On the **File** tab, select **Options**.
3. In the **Outlook Options** dialog box, select **Advanced**.
4. In the **Other** section, select the **Enable troubleshooting logging (requires restarting Outlook)** check box, and then select **OK**.

5. Restart Outlook

When Outlook uses the Availability Service to retrieve free/busy information, log files are generated in the following folders:

### Outlook 2010

%temp%\OLKAS

The file name of the log files uses the following format:

**yyyymmdd**-**hhmmssss**-AS.log

For example, a log file that is generated on March 30, 2010 at 2:14:20.0029 P.M. will be named:

20100330-1411200029-AS.log

Open this log file in a text editor such as Notepad to examine the logging information.

### Outlook 2013

%temp%\Outlook Logging

The file name of the log files uses the following format:

Outlook-*########*.etl
