# Outlook can't open a mailbox by using MAPI over HTTP

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3191500

## Symptoms

Users can't open their mailboxes in Microsoft Outlook by using MAPI over HTTP.

## Cause

This issue occurs if all authentication methods for the MAPI virtual directory are disabled.

Editing the MAPI virtual directory through the Exchange Admin Center causes the `Set-MapiVirtualDirectory` cmdlet to run without having `IISAuthenticationMethods` configured. The syntax of the cmdlet resembles the following:

```powershell
Set-MapiVirtualDirectory -ExternalUrl 'https://mapi.contoso.com/mapi' -IISAuthenticationMethods @() -Identity '1d4e91f5-b1ae-4863-a071-2822210f05b9'
```

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use the `Set-MapiVirtualDirectory` cmdlet to enable the IIS authentication methods, as follows:

```powershell
Get-MapiVirtualDirectory -Server <ServerName>| Set-MapiVirtualDirectory -IISAuthenticationMethods Ntlm,OAuth,Negotiate
```

## More information

For more information about this cmdlet, see [Set-MapiVirtualDirectory](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mapivirtualdirectory).
