## More information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

Instead of using the Command Line method, you can also view and remove the `WinHttpSettings` registry value.

1. Depending on your Windows and Office bitness, browse to and select the appropriate registry key:

    `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connection`  `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connection`

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Wow6432Node hive is used when a 32-bit version of Office is installed on 64-bit version of Windows.

2. Find the `WinHttpSettings` value. You can double-click the `WinHttpSettings` value to view the Value data if you choose.
3. Right-click the `WinHttpSettings` value, and then select **Delete**.
