# You can't expand a nested contact group and Unknown is displayed in the group name in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4293589

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook, you try expand a contact group in a public folder that contains a nested contact group. However, the contact group does not expand, and the text **\<Unknown>** appears at the end of the group name.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, right-click the Contact folder in the Public Folder, and then select **Properties**. On the Outlook **Address Book** tab, select the **Show this folder as an email address book** option.

## More information

A similar issue occurs if another user adds a contact group from their own contacts to the public folder contact group, and then a different user tries to send an email message to that contact group. This scenario is not resolved by the **Show this folder as an email address book** option.
