# The Contact Card in Outlook 2010 does not change when you try to customize it by using Group Policy or the Office Customization Tool (OCT)

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 981022

## Symptoms

When you use Group Policy or the Office Customization Tool (OCT) to customize the **Contact Card** in Microsoft Outlook 2010, the Contact Card remains unchanged.

For example, you try to replace the **Department** field on the contact card with another attribute from the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS). After you deploy this change, the Contact Card remains unchanged. All default fields remain displayed on the Contact Card. The default Contact Card fields are shown in the following figure.

:::image type="content" source="media/contact-card-cannot-be-changed-by-group-policy-or-oct/default-contact-card-fields.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the default Contact Card fields." border="false":::

This problem occurs for all settings that you configure under the **Office 2010\Contact Card\Contact Tab** node in the settings tree. The following figure shows these settings in the Office Customization Tool.

:::image type="content" source="media/contact-card-cannot-be-changed-by-group-policy-or-oct/contact-tab-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows these settings in the Office Customization Tool." border="false":::

A similar tree structure for these settings is also shown in the Group Policy Management Console.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Group Policy and OCT template files do not contain the correct registry settings to customize the Contact Card settings under the **Contact Tab** section.

## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

To work around this problem, use the following registry information to customize which fields are displayed on the **Contact Card**.

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\ContactCard`

> [!NOTE]
> The `\Policies` hive in the registry must be used.

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace#  
Value: Any text that you want to replace the default text that is displayed in the Contact Card.

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabMAPIReplace#  
Value: The hexadecimal value that corresponds to the MAPI value of an attribute from AD DS. Please see Table 2 for allowed values.

> [!NOTE]
> For these two registry values, use an integer between 1 and 8 for the placeholder **#**. Table 1 specifies the default item displayed on the Contact Card and the integer value to use in the registry if you want to replace this item with another attribute from AD DS.

Table 1: Contact Card default item line item integer values

|Default Item|Integer value|
|---|---|
|Department|1|
|Office|2|
|Work|3|
|Mobile|4|
|Home|5|
|E-mail|6|

|Location|8|

Not every attribute that is listed in this MSDN article is available for customization in the Contact Card.

## How to rearrange the Location and Calendar fields

The **Location** and **Calendar** fields in the Contact Card differ from the other fields in the Contact Card. These two fields do not pull data from MAPI properties. The data for the Calendar field is retrieved from your current free/busy data, and the data for the Location field is retrieved from the Location setting in Office Communicator, as shown in the following figure:

:::image type="content" source="media/contact-card-cannot-be-changed-by-group-policy-or-oct/location-setting-in-office-communicator.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Location setting in Office Communicator" border="false":::

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Office Communicator must be running for the data to appear next to the Location field in the Contact Card.

The following registry information is used to move the **Calendar** and **Location** fields in the Contact Card from their default locations.

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\ContactCard`

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabCalendarLineMove  
Value: An integer value between 1 and 8

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabLocationLineMove  
Value: An integer value between 1 and 8

## How to leave a blank line in the Contact Card

If you want to leave a blank line in the Contact Card lines, specify the registry settings as follows:

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace#

Value: Leave this field blank  
DWORD: TurnOnContactTabMAPIReplace#  
Value: 0

> [!NOTE]
> For these two registry values, use an integer between 1 and 8 instead of the placeholder **#**.

This method is demonstrated in the following figure in which the Calendar line in the Contact Card is left blank.

:::image type="content" source="media/contact-card-cannot-be-changed-by-group-policy-or-oct/calendar-line-blank-in-contact-card.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Calendar line in the Contact Card is left blank" border="false":::

## Workaround Example

The following example registry settings make several customizations to the default Contact Card:

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Common\ContactCard`

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace4  
Value: Alias

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabMAPIReplace4  
Value: 3a00001f

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace5  
Value: E-mail

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabMAPIReplace5  
Value: 39fe001f

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace6  
Value: Free/Busy

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabCalendarLineMove  
Value: 6

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabLocationLineMove  
Value: 7

String: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace7  
Value: IM Location

DWORD: TurnOnContactTabLabelReplace8  
Value: Leave this value blank

With the changes that were made, the Contact Card shows the following customizations:

- The **Mobile** label in line 4 is replaced by the **Alias** label.
- The user's `mailNickname` attribute is displayed in line 4.
- The **E-mail** label is moved to line 5, which replaces the default **Home** label.
- The user's mail attribute is displayed in line 5.
- The **Calendar** label is replaced by the **Free/busy** label and the label is located in line 6.
- The free/busy information is moved to line 6.
- The **Location** label is replaced by the **IM Location** label and the label is located in line 7.
- Line 8 is replaced by a blank line.

The following figure shows these customizations:

:::image type="content" source="media/contact-card-cannot-be-changed-by-group-policy-or-oct/customizations.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the customizations" border="false":::

## More information

The Contact Card is also available in other Microsoft Office programs, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint and SharePoint. To customize the Contact Card entries when you use Office programs other than Outlook, use the following registry value instead of the TurnOnContactTabADReplace# value.

String: TurnOnContactTabADReplace#  
Value: An AD DS attribute. Please see the AD DS Attribute column in Table 2 for allowed values. Replace the **#** with an integer between 1 and 8, based on the values that are listed in Table 1 .

The main differences between Outlook and the other Office programs are as follows:

- Outlook must use a MAPI property and the registry value is a DWORD.
- Other Office programs must use an AD DS attribute and the registry value is a String.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AD DS Attributes names are case sensitive.
