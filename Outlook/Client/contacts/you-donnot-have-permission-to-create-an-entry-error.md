# You don't have permission to create an entry in this folder error when you add contacts to a contacts folder

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4514534

## Symptoms

After a G Suite migration to Microsoft 365, users receive the following error message when they try to create or edit their contacts in the Outlook desktop client:

> You don't have permission to create an entry in this folder.  Right-click the folder, and then click Properties to check your permissions for the folder.  See the folder owner or your administrator to change your permissions.

## Cause

This error occurs because the Contacts folder was flagged as ReadOnly by the service during the migration.

## Status - Service fix

A service side fix has been deployed. The fixed version is 15.20.2132.000â€‹ or a later version.

> [!NOTE]
> The service side fix will be available only for new migrations. Migrations that are run before this update must follow the workaround steps in this article.
