# Weird folder names after PST migration from Exchange Server 2003 to Exchange Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2978469

## Symptom

Consider the following scenario:

- You export data from a Mailbox on Exchange Server 2003 to a pst file by using Mailbox Merge Wizard (ExMerge).
- You use the `New-MailboxImportRequest` cmdlet to import the pst file into a Mailbox on Exchange Server 2013.

In this scenario, the folder names in the Exchange Server 2013 Mailbox appear with special characters.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the pst files that were created by ExMerge are in non-Unicode code and this is not supported by Exchange 2013.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use Microsoft Outlook to export the data from the mailbox on Exchange Server 2003. Outlook creates a Unicode data file (.pst). Then use the `New-MailboxImportRequest` cmdlet to import the PST file. For more information about how to import the pst file to Mailbox, see [Mailbox Import and Export Requests](/exchange/mailbox-import-and-export-requests-exchange-2013-help).
