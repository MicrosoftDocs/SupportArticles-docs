# MAPI Advise() call returns 0x8007000E (E_OUTOFMEMORY)

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 269794

## Symptoms

When you call the Advise function about 7,800 to 7,900 times, the next Advise call may fail with the error 0x8007000E (E_OUTOFMEMORY).

## Cause

Notifications, which are registered by calling Advise, use a shared memory space. By default the heap size is set as 0x100000. If the heap size is exceeded when registering a new notification, the E_OUTOFMEMORY error is returned.

This limit is system-wide; in other words, if you are running two programs that call Advise, the combined maximum for both programs should be less than 7,900.

## Workaround

You can configure the heap size to be as high as 0x800000 by setting the following registry keys:

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem  
Value Name: SharedMemMaxSize  
Value Type: REG_DWORD  
Value Data: 0x800000

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem\Applications\\\<MyApp>  
Value Name: SharedMemMaxSize  
Value Type: REG_DWORD  
Value Data: 0x800000

In this scenario, **\<MyApp>** is the name of your application (without the .exe extension). For example, if your application is Mad.exe, enter MAD for the **\<MyApp>** value.
