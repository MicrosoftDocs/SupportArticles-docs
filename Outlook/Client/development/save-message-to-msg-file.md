# INFO: Save message to MSG compound file

## Summary

This article contains code that demonstrates how to save a message to a compound document, specifically an .msg file that is readable by any client that supports the .msg file format.

## More information

The function below takes a valid message object as an in parameter and uses its properties to create a duplicate of the message and save it to a compound file using the .msg format. The subject line of the message is used as the file name of the new file.

> [!NOTE]
> Special characters in the subject line of the in parameter of this function can cause unexpected results. While code can be written to avoid special characters in the subject line, it is not germane to the topic and such code is intentionally left out.

All versions of Outlook and the Exchange Client support CLSID_MailMessage as the compound document. The only reason to use a different CLSID is to support other clients that use a different CLISD when you write messages to structured storage.

When saving messages that have a large number of recipients or attachments, it's possible that the CopyTo operation will fail with MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY. This is due to a known problem with structured storage and streams. Every time that a new attachment or recipient is added to the message being saved in structured storage, a new Root Storage File is opened. These files are not closed until the transaction is completed. Because the operating system imposes a limit on the number of simultaneously open root storage files, there's no known workaround.
