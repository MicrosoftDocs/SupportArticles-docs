## Symptoms

When you start Microsoft Outlook, Outlook does not automatically perform a send and receive operation to download messages from the server.

3. Under **Send/Receive Group Name**, type the new group name, and then select **OK**.
4. Under **Group Name**, select the old group name.
5. Under both **When Outlook is Online** and **When Outlook is Offline**, clear the check box for **Include this group in Send/Receive (F9)**.
6. Select **Close**.
7. Quit Outlook, and then restart Outlook.

## Resolution for Outlook 2010 and later versions

To resolve this behavior, create a new Send/Receive group in Outlook:

1. Select **File**, and then select **Options**.
2. Select the **Advanced** tab.
3. In the **Find Send and Receive** section, select **Send/Receive**.
4. Under **Group Name**, select the group, and then select **Copy**.
