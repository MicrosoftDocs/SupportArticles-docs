# Email messages remain in the Outbox because of Deferred Delivery rule

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2894412

## Symptoms

When you send an email message, it may remain in the Outbox folder for at least one minute before it's sent.

## Cause

This problem can occur if you have a Deferred Delivery rule configured to delay the sending of some or all email messages.

## Resolution

Use the following steps to determine if you have a Deferred Delivery rule configured and if so, the criteria configured for the rule.

- Outlook 2010 or later versions

  1. Click **Rules** on the Ribbon and then click **Manage Rules & Alerts**.

  2. Select each rule listed on the **Email Rules** tab and then examine the information under **Rule description**.

      Rules that delay delivery on *Send* will have *defer delivery by # minutes* in the rule description.

  3. Double-click any rule to examine the criteria specified for the rule.
  
  4. If needed, clear the defer delivery by a number of minutes action.

     This setting is shown enabled in the following figure.
