# How to create a recurring e-mail message in Outlook

## Summary

This article describes a method for creating a recurring reminder e-mail message.

## More Information

Outlook does not provide a means to create recurring e-mail messages. For example, you might want to send an e-mail message every month to remind a group of people that a report is due. While you can set up appointments and tasks as recurring events, you cannot create a recurring e-mail message.

You can use Visual Basic Script and the recurrence settings of a task to automatically generate a recurring e-mail message. This procedure consists of the following tasks:

1. Publish a custom task form that creates an e-mail message when the task status equals completed.    
2. Use the custom task form to create a recurring task.    
3. When the task comes due, mark it as completed. The code will generate the boilerplate message, which you then send. At the same time, a new task is created because the original task was set to recur.

### Publish a Custom Task Form

1. Start Outlook and open your Tasks folder.    
2. On the **Actions **menu, click **New Task**. 
3. On the **Tools** menu, point to **Forms**, and then click **Design This Form**.    
4. On the **Form** menu, click **View Code**, and type the following code in the Script Editor:   

    ```vb
    Sub Item_PropertyChange(ByVal Name)    Select Case Name     Case "Status"             if Item.Status = 2 then '2 = Completed                     Set NewItem = Application.CreateItem(0)                    NewItem.To = "myemailaddress@myisp.com"                    NewItem.Recipients.ResolveAll                    NewItem.Subject = "This is the message subject text"                    NewItem.Body = "This is text that will appear in the body of the message."                    NewItem.Display             End IF     End Select     End Sub
    ```

5. In the Script Editor, on the** File** menu, click** Close**.    
6. On the **Tools** menu, point to **Forms**, and then click **Publish Form**.    
7. In the **Look in** list, click **Tasks**. In the **Display Name** and **Form Name** boxes, type Reminder, and then click **Publish**.    
8. On the **File **menu, click **Close**. Do not save changes.    
 
> [!NOTE]
> In the code, substitute your own information inside the quotation marks for **NewItem.To, NewItem.Subject**, and **NewItem.Body**. These lines set the **To**, **Subject**, and body of your reminder message. 

### Create a Recurring Task Using the Custom Form

1. Open your Tasks folder, where you published the custom reminder form.    
2. On the **Actions** menu, click **New Reminder**. This will open a new task based on your custom form.    
3. Type a subject for your reminder task. In **Due Date**, click to select a due date from the calendar. Click to select the **Reminder** check box.    
4. On the** Actions** menu, click **Recurrence**, and set how often you want the reminder message sent.    
5. Click **Save and Close**.    
 
### To Send Reminder E-mail
 
When you receive the reminder that the task is due, click **Open Item**. In the **Status **box, click to select **Completed**.

-or-

Dismiss the reminder and in your Tasks list, click **Completed**.

Setting the task as completed will automatically generate a new task and display an e-mail message containing your boilerplate text. Click **Send** to send the message.

You can further automate the message. If you add the line **NewItem.Send** immediately below the **NewItem.Display** line, the message is automatically sent when you mark the task as completed.

> [!NOTE]
> In Microsoft Outlook 2002, after you click **Completed** in the **Status** box, you receive the following message: 
> 
> **A program is trying to access e-mail address you have stored in Outlook. Do you want to allow this? Click Yes to send the message.**
