# “The Calendar folder cannot be found” or “The Tasks folder cannot be found” error when you use Quick Steps in Outlook

## Symptoms

When you use an IMAP or POP account that's added as a secondary account to the Outlook profile and try to use any of the following **Quick Steps**, you receive one of two error messages:

```
“The Calendar folder cannot be found” or “The Tasks folder cannot be found”.
```

**Quick Steps**:

* Create a task with attachment
* Create a task with text of message
* Create an appointment with attachment
* Create an appointment with text of message

## Cause

This is a known limitation in Outlook.

Outlook does not synchronize the **Calendar** or **Tasks** folder with the server for IMAP or POP accounts. If the primary account is configured as an IMAP or POP email account, a **Calendar** or **Tasks** folder is created locally so that these features can still be used within Outlook. However, non-primary IMAP or POP accounts don't have these folders created, and any attempt to interact with these folders by using **Quick Steps** will generate this error.

## More information
