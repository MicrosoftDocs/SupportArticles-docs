# Outlook Cached Exchange Mode Sync Setting is displayed incorrectly in GPMC

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4057720

## Symptoms

When you use the Microsoft Outlook administrative template to configure the **Cached Exchange Mode Sync Setting** policy to **One week**, **Two weeks**, or **All**, the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) does not differentiate between these options, and it always shows **Three days** when you reopen the management console.

## More information

This only affects the way that the setting is displayed in GPMC. Actually, the **Cached Exchange Mode Sync Setting** policy works correctly as it's configured.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also configure the cache mode setting by using the `SyncWindowSetting` and the `SyncWindowSettingDays` registry keys.
