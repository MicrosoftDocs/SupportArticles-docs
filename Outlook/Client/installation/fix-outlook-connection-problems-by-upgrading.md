# Fix Outlook connection problems by upgrading to the latest version

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2972952

## More information

If the latest updates for Outlook aren't applied, you may experience the following problems:

- You're intermittently or repeatedly prompted for your password.
- You're unable to set up a mail profile.
- You're unable to connect to a mailbox.
- You experience feature-related issues (Mail, Calendar, or Contacts issues, for example).

To fix these problems, set up Office to automatically update to the latest version. To do this, use one of the following methods, as appropriate for your situation.

### Office 2013

1. Start an Office 2013 program.
2. On the **File** tab, select **Office Account** or **Account**.
3. Do one of the following:
   - If you see an **Update Options** button, select **Enable Updates**. Or, if updates are already enabled, but you're not running the latest build of Outlook, select **Update Now**.
   - If you don't see an **Update Options** button, see [Install Office updates](https://support.microsoft.com/office/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) to install the latest updates.

### Office 2010 and the 2007 Microsoft Office system

See [Install Office updates](https://support.microsoft.com/office/install-office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us) to install the latest updates.
