# No default mail client error when MSIComponentID registry value is incorrect for Outlook 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2991457

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario. A user is running Office 2013 with Outlook 2013 as their default mail client:

- In Microsoft Word a user attempts to share a document as an attachment by email or when a user attempts a mail merge and receives the errors:

    > Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.
    >
    > Word couldn't send mail because of MAPI failure: "Unspecified error".

- In Microsoft PowerPoint a user attempts to share a presentation as an attachment by email and receives the errors:

    > Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.
    >
    > There was a general failure with the e-mail system and this action could not be completed.

- In Microsoft Excel a user attempts to share a spreadsheet as an attachment by email and receives the errors

    > Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.
    >
    > General mail failure. Quit Microsoft Excel, restart the mail system, and try again.

- A user in Windows Explorer attempts to send a file to a mail recipient and receives the error:

  > Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill the messaging request. Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the `MSIComponentID` is set to an improper GUID for Outlook 2013. The correct GUID for Outlook 2013 is {6DB1921F-8B40-4406-A18B-E906DBEEF0C9}.

## Resolution

2. Select **Program and Features**.
3. Select Microsoft Office 2013, select either **Quick Repair** or **Online Repair**.
