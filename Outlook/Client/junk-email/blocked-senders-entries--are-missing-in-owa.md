# Blocked Senders entries in Outlook are missing in Outlook Web App

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3060496

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook, certain domain entries that appear in the **Blocked Senders** list in the Outlook client may be missing when you view the same **Blocked Senders** list in Outlook Web App. These missing entries have not been moved to the Junk E-mail folder and are not otherwise filtered in Outlook Web App if Outlook is not running.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the **Blocked Senders** list domain entries were created through Outlook, and if they do not begin with the @ sign. For example, the following entries are displayed in the **Blocked Senders** list in both Outlook and Outlook Web App:

`@contoso.com`  
`@wingtiptoys.com`  

However, the following entries are displayed in the **Blocked Senders** list only in the Outlook client, not in Outlook Web App:

`contoso.com`  
`wingtiptoys.com`  

This behavior occurs because Outlook provides additional Blocked Senders functionality for the inclusion of subdomains when the @ sign is not present in the Blocked Senders domain entry. For example, although `@contoso.com` filters all senders who have `@contoso.com` in their email address, `contoso.com` also filters domain entries that resemble the following:

`subdomain1.contoso.com`  
`subdomain2.contoso.com`  
`subdomain3.contoso.com`

This helps prevent spam from being delivered to the Inbox when the subdomain portion of the email address has been randomized.

Subdomain filtering for a Blocked Senders domain is a client-side feature and is available only in Outlook, not through Outlook Web App on Exchange Server. Additionally, you can add a domain entry without an @ sign only in Outlook. Outlook Web App adds an @ sign if you try to create a domain entry without one.

## Resolution

When you add blocked senders through Outlook, include the @ sign at the beginning of the Blocked Senders domain entries that must be honored by Outlook Web App and Exchange Server.

To add a Blocked Senders domain in Outlook, follow these steps:

1. On the **Home** tab on the ribbon, select the Junk drop-down list.
2. Select **Junk E-mail Options**.
3. On the **Blocked Senders** tab, select **Add**.
4. Enter the domain entry that you want, and include an @ sign at the beginning of the entry if you want it to also appear in OWA, as in the following figure.

5. Select **OK**, and then select **OK** again to exit the **Junk E-mail Options** dialog box.
