# Junk email message settings aren't synchronized when you use Outlook 2013 to connect to an Outlook.com account

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2861826

## Symptoms

When you use Outlook 2013 to connect to an `Outlook.com` account, the junk email message settings aren't synchronized between Outlook 2013 and `Outlook.com`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The junk email message settings include the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists.
> - `Outlook.com` accounts include `Hotmail.c`om, `Msn.com`, and `Live.com` accounts.

## Cause

This issue occurs because Outlook 2013 uses Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) to connect to the `Outlook.com` account. However, the EAS protocol does not support the synchronization of the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists in the Junk E-mail Options dialog box.

There are several options that you can use to manage the junk email message settings on `Outlook.com`. To work around the issue that's described in the [Symptoms](#symptoms) section, use one of the following workarounds.

## Workaround 1: Block or enable senders on Outlook.com

Instead of configuring the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists on each Outlook 2013 client that you use, you can configure the **Safe senders** and **Blocked senders** lists on `Outlook.com`.

If you block or enable senders on `Outlook.com`, the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists in the Outlook 2013 clients are not updated. However, email messages are processed by the `Outlook.com` service. Therefore, if an email message is blocked by the `Outlook.com` service, the email message is not delivered to the Outlook 2013 clients.

To use this workaround, add the information from the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists in each Outlook 2013 client that you use to the **Safe senders** and **Blocked senders**  lists on the **Options**  webpage on `Outlook.com`. To access the **Options** webpage, click **More mail settings** on `Outlook.com`. Then, remove the lists from each Outlook 2013 client. If you want to back up the lists before you remove them, click the **Export to File** button in the **Junk E-mail Options** dialog box in Outlook 2013.

## Workaround 2: Manually add or remove email messages

If you manually move an email message to, or remove an email message from, the **Junk E-Mail** folder in an Outlook 2013 client, the email message is also moved on `Outlook.com`. Similarly, if you move an email message to or remove an email message from the **Junk** folder on `Outlook.com`, the email message is also moved in Outlook 2013. When you manually move an email message to or remove an email message from the junk email message folders, the `Outlook.com` service uses this information to improve its junk email message criteria.

## Workaround 3: Block or enable senders in Outlook 2013

If you use the **Safe Senders** and **Blocked Senders** lists on an Outlook 2013 client, the lists are maintained only on that client. If the Outlook 2013 client blocks an email message according to the **Blocked Senders** list, the email message is moved to the **Junk E-Mail** folder on the Outlook 2013 client. When the Outlook 2013 client is synchronized with `Outlook.com`, the email message is also moved to the **Junk** folder on `Outlook.com`. However, the **Blocked senders** list on `Outlook.com` is not updated to include the sender of the blocked email message.

## More information

Because Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 use Outlook Hotmail Connector to connect to `Outlook.com` accounts, this issue only occurs in Outlook 2013.
