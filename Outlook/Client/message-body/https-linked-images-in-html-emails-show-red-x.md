## Cause

This problem occurs when the Internet Explorer Security setting **Do not save encrypted pages to disk** option is enabled.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, disable the Internet Explorer Security setting **Do not save encrypted pages to disk**.

1. Exit Outlook
2. Open Internet Options, and then select the **Advanced** tab.
3. Under the Security heading, disable the **Do not save encrypted pages to disk** option.
4. Select **OK**.
5. Start Outlook.

In the event you are unable to disable the **Do not save encrypted pages to disk** option, it is being managed by Group Policy. Contact your system administrator to determine the appropriate configuration for this setting.
