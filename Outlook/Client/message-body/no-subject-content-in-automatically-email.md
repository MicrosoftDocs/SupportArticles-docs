# Automatically generated email messages in Outlook don't contain Subject or contents

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3114786

## Symptoms

When you use an HTML-based page to automatically create email messages in Microsoft Outlook, the message's Subject line and body may not be created.

## Cause

This issue occurs if your computer doesn't have the following registry key:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Clients\Mail`

If you have the most recent versions of Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge installed, you must have this registry key on your system.

## Resolution

> [!WARNING]
> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use Registry Editor to manually add the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Clients\Mail` registry key. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Exit Outlook and Internet Explorer.

1. Start Registry Editor. To do this, use one of the following procedures, as appropriate for your version of Windows.

    Windows 8 and Windows 10: Press the Windows Key + R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type regedit.exe, and then click **OK**.

    Windows 7 and Windows Vista: Click **Start**, type regedit in the **Start Search**  box, and then press Enter. If you're prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click **Allow**.

    Windows XP: Click **Start**, click **Run**, type regedit, and then click **OK**.

1. Locate the following registry key:

    `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Clients`

    1. Select the **Clients** subkey.
    1. On the **Edit** menu, click **New** -> **Key**.
    1. Type **Mail**, and then click **OK**.
    1. Exit Registry Editor.

1. Restart Outlook and Internet Explorer.

The following HTML sample automatically creates email messages:

```html

   <body>
      <FORM name=USER REGISTER action="mailto:<recipient e-mail address>" method=post target=_self encType=text/plain>
