# Pictures cannot be displayed and are shown as red X in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2638687

## Symptoms

When you open an email message that contains images in Microsoft Office Outlook, the image areas are blocked. These areas display a red X placeholder. Additionally, the images are sent or received as email attachments.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, make sure that the Temporary Internet Files folder is valid.

> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

1. Select **Start**, select **Run** (Or press Windows Key and R on your keyboard at the same time), type *regedit.exe*, and then press Enter.

   (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.)

2. Locate the following registry subkey:

   Office 2010: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Security`  
   Office 2007: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Outlook\Security`  
   Office 2003: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Outlook\Security`

3. In the right side window, double-click **OutlookSecureTempFolder**. Verify whether the folder noted is valid. You can copy and paste the folder path in Windows Explorer to verify this.

   - If you do not see the `OutlookSecureTempFolder` entry, go to the next step.
   - If the folder does not exist on your computer, change the **OutlookSecureTempFolder** value to a valid folder path, for example **C:\temp0\**.

4. If the **OutlookSecureTempFolder** registry entry does not exist, you must create it manually. To do this, follow these steps:
   1. Right-click an empty area, point to **New**, and then select **String Value**.
