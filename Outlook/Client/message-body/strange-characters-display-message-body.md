# Strange characters are displayed in meeting requests, read receipts, and IRM messages

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook and Outlook for Microsoft 365, some recipients may receive email messages with a mix of characters in various languages in the text body. The messages may take a while to load.

It may happen with:

- Read Receipts
- Email Recalls
- Meeting Requests
- IRM email messages

## Cause

A beta Windows Unicode UTF-8 support setting is enabled by the sender. Outlook doesn't support this setting.

## Workaround

To prevent this from happening on newly created items, follow these steps:

1. In Windows, hold the **Windows** key + **R** to open the **Run** prompt.
2. Type in **intl.cpl** and press **Enter**.
3. Navigate to **Administrative** > **Change system localâ€¦**.
4. Uncheck **Beta: Use Unicode for UTF-8 worldwide language support**.
5. Restart the computer.
