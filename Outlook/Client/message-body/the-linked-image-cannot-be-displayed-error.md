# The Linked image cannot be displayed error in an Outlook email message

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3096277

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013, images are not displayed in some email messages. Instead, you see a red **x** and the following text:

> Right-click here to download pictures. To help protect your privacy, Outlook prevented automatic download of this picture from the Internet.

:::image type="content" source="media/the-linked-image-cannot-be-displayed-error/right-click-here-to-download-pictures-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Right-click here to download pictures error detail.":::

Additionally, when you right-click the image and select **Download Pictures**, the following error is displayed instead of the original text:

> The linked image cannot be displayed. The file may have been moved, renamed, or deleted. Verify that the link points to the correct file and location.

:::image type="content" source="media/the-linked-image-cannot-be-displayed-error/the-linked-image-cannot-be-displayed-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the linked image cannot be displayed error detail.":::

## Cause

This issue occurs when the `BlockHTTPimages` registry value is set to **1** and the images in the email message have a source that points to a URL.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps.

Important: Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

1. Exit Outlook.

3. Type *regedit.exe*, and then press Enter.
4. Locate and select the following subkey.

    - Without Group Policy:

      Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Common  
      DWORD: BlockHTTPimages  
      Value: 1

    - With Group Policy:

      Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\policies\Microsoft\Office\x.0\Common  
      DWORD: BlockHTTPimages  
      Value: 1

5. Right-click the `BlockHTTPimages` key, and then select **Delete**.
6. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, select **Yes**.
7. On the **File** menu, select **Exit** to exit Registry Editor.
