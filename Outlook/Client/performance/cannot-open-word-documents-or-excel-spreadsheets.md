# Cannot open Word documents or Excel spreadsheets from an external source in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3020607

## Symptoms

You receive one of the following errors when you try to open a Microsoft Word document or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet from an external source:

> Word experienced an error trying to open the file. Try the following suggestions:
>
> - Check the file permissions for the document or drive.
> - Make sure there is sufficient free memory and disk space.
> - Open the file with the Text Recovery converter.  
> (C:\Users\...\test.docx)

> Microsoft Excel cannot open or save any more documents because there is not enough available memory or disk space.
>
> - To make more memory available, close workbooks or programs you no longer need.
> - To free disk space, delete files you no longer need from the disk you are saving to.

> [!NOTE]
> This error can also occur in Microsoft PowerPoint.

## Cause

This issue occurs if all the following conditions are true:

- The Windows Firewall service is not running.
- You are using Outlook on a Windows 8-based, Windows 8.1-based, or Windows Server 2012-based computer.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, start the Windows Firewall service. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Press the Windows logo key+R (to open the Run dialog box).
2. Type *services.msc*, and then select **OK**.
3. In the **Services** window, right-click **Windows Firewall**, and then select **Start**.
