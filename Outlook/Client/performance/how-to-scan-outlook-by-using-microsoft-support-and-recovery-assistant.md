# Scan Outlook by using Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4098558

## Overview

Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant use advanced diagnostics to report known problems and details about your Microsoft Outlook configuration. Reported problems are linked to public-facing documentation (usually a Microsoft Knowledge Base article) for possible fixes. If you're a Support professional, you can review customer reports that are generated in HTML format.

The scenario in the Assistant that is described in this article replaces the Outlook scanning functionality that was originally provided by the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (OffCAT).

For more information about the Assistant, see [About the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/office/about-the-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-e90bb691-c2a7-4697-a94f-88836856c72f).

## System requirements

The following operating systems are supported:

- Windows 10
- Windows 8 and Windows 8.1
- Windows 7

The Outlook program in any of the following Office versions can be scanned:

- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Office 2016 (32-bit or 64-bit; Click-to-Run or MSI installations)
- Microsoft Office 2013 (32-bit or 64-bit; Click-to-Run or MSI installations)
- Microsoft Office 2010 (32-bit or 64-bit)

If you're running Windows 7 (any edition), you must also have .NET Framework 4.5 installed. Windows 8 and later versions of Windows already include at least .NET Framework 4.5.

## Install Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

To install the Assistant and automatically start the scenario for scanning Outlook, select the following link:

> By downloading this app, you agree to the terms of the [Microsoft Services Agreement and Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement).

## Scan an Outlook configuration for known issues

The Assistant can resolve issues in many programs. To scan Outlook for known issues and create a detailed report of your Outlook configuration, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced diagnostics**, and then select **Next**.

2. Select **Outlook**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/select-to-run-outlook.png" alt-text="Select Outlook item." border="false":::

3. When you are prompted to confirm that you are using the affected machine, select **Yes**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/confirm-affected-machine.png" alt-text="Confirm that you are using the affected machine." border="false":::

4. After your account is validated in Microsoft 365, the scan automatically begins.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The scan may take several minutes to run.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/scan-begins.png" alt-text="Scan automatically begins." border="false":::

    You see the following error message if your account is in Microsoft 365 and the Assistant can't validate your credentials.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/error-message.png" alt-text="Error message details." border="false":::

   If you select **Back** to reenter your credentials, and you see this same error, select **Back** again, and then use the following sample credentials to mimic a non-Microsoft 365 account:

   - **Email address**: `juliet@contoso.com`
   - **Password**: \<any password that you want to use>

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/sign-in-using-non-office-account.png" alt-text="Sign in account example." border="false":::

   No non-Microsoft 365 account will be authenticated through the Microsoft 365 service. In this case, the Assistant provides the **Next** button to continue.

   The scan is complete when you see **We're done collecting your Outlook configuration details**.
