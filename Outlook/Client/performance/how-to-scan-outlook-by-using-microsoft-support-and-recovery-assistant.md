# How to scan Outlook by using the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4098558

## Overview

The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA) uses advanced diagnostics to report known problems and details about your Microsoft Outlook configuration. Reported problems are linked to public-facing documentation (usually a Microsoft Knowledge Base article) for possible fixes. If you're a Helpdesk professional, you can review customer reports that are generated in HTML format.

The SaRA scenario that is described in this article replaces the Outlook scanning functionality that was originally provided by the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (OffCAT).

For more information about SaRA, see [About the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/office/about-the-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-e90bb691-c2a7-4697-a94f-88836856c72f).

## System requirements

The following operating systems are supported:

- Windows 10
- Windows 8 and Windows 8.1
- Windows 7

The Outlook program in any of the following Office versions can be scanned:

- Microsoft Office 365 (2016 or 2013, 32-bit or 64-bit)
- Microsoft Office 2016 (32-bit or 64-bit; Click-to-Run or MSI installations)
- Microsoft Office 2013 (32-bit or 64-bit; Click-to-Run or MSI installations)
- Microsoft Office 2010 (32-bit or 64-bit)

If you are running Windows 7 (any edition), you must also have .NET Framework 4.5 installed. Windows 8 and later versions of Windows include at least .NET Framework 4.5.

## How to scan an Outlook configuration for known issues

The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant can resolve issues in many programs. To scan Outlook for known issues and create a detailed report of your Outlook configuration, follow these steps:

1. Select **Advanced diagnostics**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/advanced-diagnostics.png" alt-text="Select the Advanced diagnostics option." border="false":::

2. Select **Outlook**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/select-to-run-outlook.png" alt-text="Select Outlook item." border="false":::

3. When you are prompted to confirm that you are using the affected machine, select **Yes**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/confirm-affected-machine.png" alt-text="Confirm that you are using the affected machine." border="false":::

4. After your account is validated in Office 365, the scan automatically begins.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The scan may take several minutes to run.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/scan-begins.png" alt-text="Scan automatically begins." border="false":::

    You see the following error message if your account is in Office 365 and SaRA cannot validate your credentials.

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/error-message.png" alt-text="Error message details." border="false":::

   If you select **Back** to reenter your credentials, and you see this same error, select **Back** again, and then use the following sample credentials to mimic a non-Office 365 account:

   - **Email address**: `juliet@contoso.com`
   - **Password**: \<any password that you want to use>

   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/sign-in-using-non-office-account.png" alt-text="Sign in account example." border="false":::

   Any non-Office 365 account will not be authenticated through the Office 365 service. In this case, SaRA gives you an option to continue. Select the **Next** button to continue.

   The scan is complete when you see **We're done collecting your Outlook configuration details**.

## Review your Outlook scan

Your scan report includes these separate tabs:

- Issues found

### Issues found

On the **Issues found** tab, you are provided a list of configuration issues that are detected during the scan.

### Detailed view

- User name
- Computer hardware
- Windows version
- Office installation
- Outlook profile
- Registry and policies information

The information is provided in a tree view. Select any node to expand or collapse it.

### Sharing your scan results

After you review your scan results, select **Next**. The next screen provides an opportunity to see the log files that were saved on your computer (**See all logs**) or to view the log again (**View log**).

> [!NOTE]
> The scan file is ConfigurationDetails_{CorrelationId}.html. It's located in the ***%localappdata%\saralogs\UploadLogs*** folder, for example, *C:\users\\\<username>\AppData\Local\saralogs\UploadLogs*.

#### Users who have an Office 365 account

If you sign in to SaRA by using an account in Office 365, you also see an option to send your files to Microsoft. This option is helpful if you are working with a Microsoft support engineer. Select **Send** to have your log files securely uploaded.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/upload-files.png" alt-text="Select Send to have your log files securely uploaded." border="false":::

Select **Don't send** if you don't want to upload your log files. If you have to share your log files with someone, select **See all logs** to open the folder that contains all the logs that are created by SaRA.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/see-all-logs.png" alt-text="Folder contains all the log screated by SaRA." border="false":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you select **Send**, only the .json file is uploaded to Microsoft.

#### Users who do not have an Office 365 account

If you sign in to SaRA by using an account that is not in Office 365, there is no option to send your files to Microsoft.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/no-option-to-send.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows no option to send your files to Microsoft." border="false":::

For example, if you have to share your log files with your Helpdesk, select **See all logs** to open the folder that contains all the logs that are created by SaRA.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-scan-outlook-by-using-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant/example-of-selecting-see-all-logs.png" alt-text="Example of See all logs." border="false":::

You can copy the file from this folder to share with the person who is helping you to fix your Outlook issue.
