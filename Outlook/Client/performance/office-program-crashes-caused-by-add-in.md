        1. From the Start screen, type **View event logs** in the search box, and tap or click **Settings**.
        1. Tap or click **View event logs**.

    - **For Windows 7 and Windows Vista**

        1. Click **Start**.
        2. In the **Search** box, type **Event Viewer**, and then, in the list of results, double-click **Event Viewer**.

    - **For Windows XP**

        1. Click **Start** > **Control Panel** > **Performance and Maintenance**, and then click **Administrative Tools**, and then double-click **Computer Management**.

2. Now, check for the following events:

    - Event ID: 1000

        > Application Name: Winword.exe  
        > Application Version: 15.0.4481.1508  
        > Module Name: Btmofficea.dll  
        > Module Version: 2.2.0.204  
        > Offset: 0000000000009e9a

    - Event ID: 1000

        > Application Name: Excel.exe  
        > Application Version: 14.0.6117.5003  
        > Module Name: Btmoffice.dll
