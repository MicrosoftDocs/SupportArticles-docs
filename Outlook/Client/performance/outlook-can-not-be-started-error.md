## Symptoms

When I open Outlook 2010, why do I see error messages such as **Microsoft Outlook can not be started, cannot open the Outlook window, the set of folders cannot be opened, cannot access file, you do not have the permission required to access the file XXX** or **Cannot open your default e-mail folders. Cannot access file, you do not have the permission required to access the file XXX**? How can I resolve this problem?
