# Terminated in error found in Outlook Sync Issues log files

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2991453

## Symptoms

Using a Cached Mode profile, in Microsoft Outlook you see the following error in messages with the subject Synchronization Log in the Sync Issues folder:

> Terminated in error  
[80040600-501-80040600-560]  
The client operation failed.

This error may appear alone, or accompany other actions or conditions, such as Send/Receive, missing email, or slow synchronization with Exchange Server.

## Cause

This error has been associated with Outlook Data File (OST) corruption. The cause of corruption has never been determined.

## Resolution

The error may be resolved in Outlook 2016, Outlook 2013 or Outlook 2007 by deleting and recreating the Outlook Cached Mode OST file. If that fails, then creating a new Outlook profile will resolve the issue.

Delete and recreate the OST file

- Outlook 2019, 2016, 2013, or Outlook for Microsoft 365
  1. On the **File** tab, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Account Settings**.
  2. In the **Account Settings** dialog, select **Data Files**.
  3. Locate the OST file for your email address, and note the path and filename of the OST file.
