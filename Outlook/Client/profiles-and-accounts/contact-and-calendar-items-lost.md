# Contact and Calendar items are lost after you delete an IMAP account in Outlook 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3062835

## Symptoms

After you delete an IMAP account in Microsoft Outlook 2013, and then you restore the IMAP account on that computer or you add the same account on a different computer, you notice that Contact and Calendar items are missing. This occurs even though you first synchronize the offline Outlook data file (`.ost`) with the IMAP account.

## More information

This problem is by design. Because of a change in Microsoft Outlook 2013 Service Pack 1, the `.ost` file is also deleted when an email account such as an IMAP or Exchange account is deleted from an Outlook profile. The `.ost` file that is associated with the IMAP account contains Contact and Calendar items. Therefore, these items are deleted together with the `.ost` file.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
