# Contents of Public Folder Favorites folder not removed from offline folder files if Download Public Folder Favorites is turn off

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 822507

## Symptoms

If you turn off the **Download Public Folder Favorites** option in Microsoft Outlook 2003 or in Outlook 2007, the contents of the Public Folder Favorites folder are not removed from your offline folder files (`.ost`).

## Cause

This behavior occurs because all future synchronization stops when you turn off the **Download Public Folder Favorites** option. This prevents the `.ost` from receiving new files and growing larger, but it does not remove the files that have already been downloaded.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, turn off the **Download Public Folder Favorites** option, and then clear offline items from each Public Folder Favorite folder that is in your `.ost` file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Outlook.
2. Select **Tools**, select **E-Mail Accounts**, select **View or change existing e-mail accounts**, and then select **Next**.
3. In the **Name** list, select your Microsoft Exchange server, and then select **Change**.
4. Select **More Settings**, and then select the **Advanced** tab.
5. Under **Cached Exchange Mode Settings**, clear the **Download Public Folder Favorites** check box, and then select **OK**.
6. In the Outlook navigation pane, right-click a Public Folder Favorites folder, and then select **Properties**.
7. On the **General** tab, select **Clear Offline Items**.
8. Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each Public Folder Favorites folder that you want to clear.
