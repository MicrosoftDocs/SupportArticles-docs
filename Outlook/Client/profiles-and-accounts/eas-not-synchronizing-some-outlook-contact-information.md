# Exchange ActiveSync does not synchronize some Outlook contact information as expected

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2692134

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- Your mailbox is hosted on a server that is running Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 or Exchange Server 2007.
- You create a new contact in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.
- Under **Phone numbers**, you type a telephone number in the **Home** and **Mobile** fields.
- You select **Business**, select **Other**, and then type a telephone number in the **Other** field.
- You synchronize your mobile device that uses Exchange ActiveSync over-the-air.

In this scenario, the information in the **Home** and **Mobile** fields is synchronized as expected. However, the information in the **Other** field does not synchronize as expected.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the EAS protocol does not support synchronizing some contact information.

## More information

The behavior that is mentioned in the Symptoms section can occur if you change the field name for any of the default fields. For example, if you select **Business**, **Home**, **Business FAX**, or **Mobile**, and then change the field name to **Other**, the data is not synchronized as expected.

The following table summarizes the field names that will synchronize and that will not synchronize as expected:

|Field names that will synchronize|Field names that will not synchronize|
|---|---|
|Company|Assistant|
|Pager|Callback|
|Business|Car|
|Business 2|ISDN|
|Business Fax|Other Fax|
|Home|Primary|
|Home 2|Other|
|Home Fax|Radio|
|Mobile|Telex|
