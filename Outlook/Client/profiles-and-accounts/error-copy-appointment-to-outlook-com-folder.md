# Error when you copy an appointment to an Outlook.com calendar folder: Cannot move the items

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2877849

## Summary

When you try to copy an appointment or meeting from another store to an `Outlook.com` folder, you receive the following error:

> Cannot move the items. You cannot move one occurrence of an appointment series to a different folder. To move a recurring appointment, you must move the original appointment or copy the single occurrence and move the copy.

## More information

If you copy appointments to a calendar folder on an `Outlook.com` account, the behavior will vary, depending on the following factors:

- Whether you're moving or copying the appointment
- The current view

The following table summarizes what occurs when you move or copy appointments to an EAS-based store.
