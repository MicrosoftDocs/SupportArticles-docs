## Resolution

To fix these issues for Outlook for Microsoft 365, update your Office installation to version 2008 (Build 13127.20508) or a later version.

There is no resolution for Outlook 2016 and Outlook 2013 at this time. Use the appropriate workarounds for these products.

## Workaround

### For Outlook for Microsoft 365 and Outlook 2016

To work around these issues, try Method 1 first. If that doesn't fix the issues, try Method 2.

#### Method 1: Delete the SecurityManager key in the registry

The issues might be caused by the registry values under this subkey:

`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SecurityManager\CapAuthz\ApplicationsEx`

Delete the **SecurityManager** key and its subkeys in the registry.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) for restoration in case problems occur.

1. Exit Outlook.
2. Start **Registry Editor**.
   - For **Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8**: Press Windows logo key+R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type **regedit.exe**, and then select **OK**.
   - For **Windows 7**: Select **Start**, type **regedit.exe** in the search box, and then press Enter.
3. In Registry Editor, locate the following subkey in the registry:

    `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\REGISTRY\MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SecurityManager\CapAuthz\ApplicationsEx`

4. Right-click the **SecurityManager** key, and select **Permissions**.
5. Select **Advanced**, and select the **Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object** check box.
6. Select **OK**.
7. Select **yes** if you receive the following notification: "**This will replace explicitly defined permissions on all descendants of this object with inheritable permissions from \<parent key>. Do you wish to continue?**
8. Select **OK**.
9. Right-click the **SecurityManager** key, and select **Delete** to delete the **SecurityManager** key and the subkeys.
10. Exit **Registry Editor**.
11. [Repair the Office application](https://support.microsoft.com/office/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b), and check whether the issues have been resolved.

#### Method 2: Stop third-party applications that access MAPISVC.inf file

These issues may also be caused by third-party applications that access MAPISVC.inf and prevent Outlook from setting up the Account Manager. To mitigate this situation, stop the applications and processes that may be affecting MAPISVC.inf.

Use [Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) to see the processes that are accessing MAPISVC.inf. If a process displays a **SHARING_VIOLATION on MAPISVC.inf**, it indicates that the associated application is likely to be responsible for the issues. For instance, RepMgr.exe (C:\Program Files\Confer\RepMgr.exe) is an application that is known to cause these issues. Stop this process if you see it in Process Monitor.

### For Outlook 2013

To work around these issues, try Method 1 first. If that doesn't fix the issues, try Method 2.

#### Method 1: Verify permissions in the registry

In some cases, the issues are related to a permissions issue in the registry. To determine whether this is the cause of the issues and then fix them, follow these steps:

1. Exit Outlook.
2. Start **Registry Editor**.
   - For **Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8**: Press Windows logo key+R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type **regedit.exe**, and then select **OK**.
   - For **Windows 7**: Select **Start**, type **regedit.exe** in the search box, and then press Enter.

3. In Registry Editor, locate and right-click the following subkey in the registry, and then select **Permissions**:

    `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Components\F1291BD604B860441AB89E60BDEE0F9C`

4. Under Group or user names, find your own user name or a group that you're a member of (such as Users or Administrators).

    If you're unsure about which groups your user account is a member of, follow these steps:
   - Open **Control Panel**.
   - From **Category** view, select **User Accounts**, and then select **User Accounts** again.
   - Select **Manage User Accounts**.
   - In the **User Accounts** window, find your **User Name**, and review the groups that are listed in the **Group** column.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may have to expand the **Group** column to view all the groups.
   - When you are finished, select **Cancel**.

5. If you do not see a group that you're a member of or your own user name listed in the permissions list, select **Add**, and then add your own user account.
6. Select **OK**.
7. Select your user name or the group that you're a member of.
8. View the permissions for your user name or group, and make sure that the **Read** permission has **Allow** selected.
9. Select **OK**.
10. Exit Registry Editor.
