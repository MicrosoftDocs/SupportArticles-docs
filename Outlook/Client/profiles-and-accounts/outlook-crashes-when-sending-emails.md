# Outlook crashes when trying to send emails because of a nonexistent delivery location setting in your profile

## Symptoms

Microsoft Outlook crashes when you try to send email messages.

If you review the crash details, you see information that resembles the following error signature:

> **Application Name**: Outlook.exe  
> **Application Version**: 14.0.4760.1000  
> **Module Name**: OLMAPI32.dll  
> **Module Version**: 14.0.4760.1000  
> **Offset**: 0x000cf4fb

## Cause

This problem occurs when you are using a POP3 email account, and the default delivery location for this account references a nonexistent folder.

> [!NOTE]
> This problem may occur most frequently when you have a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox and a POP3 account in the same profile. However, this problem can also occur if you do not have an Exchange Server mailbox in your profile.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, update your POP3 email account to reference a valid folder. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Exit Outlook if it is running.
2. In the **Mail** control panel, select **Show Profiles**.
3. In the **Mail** dialog box, select your Outlook profile that has the POP3 account, and then select **Properties**.
4. In the **Mail Setup** dialog box, select **E-mail Accounts**.
5. In the **E-mail Accounts** section of the **Account Settings** dialog box, on the **E-mail** tab, select your POP3 account, and then select **Change Folder**.

8. Start Outlook.
