# Outlook displays an error message on first start

## Symptoms

After you successfully add your Microsoft Exchange email account to Microsoft Outlook, and start Outlook for the first time, the following error message is displayed:

> An unexpected error has occurred.

## Cause

This error occurs if your Windows user profile contains a unicode character as shown in the following screenshot:

If your Windows device is AzureAD-joined and you sign in to Windows with your AzureAD account, your Windows user profile will be built with your AzureAD display name. If your AzureAD display name includes a unicode character, it will be used in your Windows user profile name as well.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, change your regional settings.

1. Open **Control Panel**, and select **Change date, time, or number formats**.
1. In the **Region** dialog box on the **Administrative** tab, select **Change system locale**.
1. In the **Region Settings** dialog box, select the check box for **Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/outlook-displays-error-message-on-first-start/region-settings-dialog.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Region Settings dialog box with the check box for Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support selected." border="true":::

1. Select **OK** and when prompted, restart Windows.
1. Open Outlook. It should start without displaying the error message.
1. Open the **Region Settings** dialog box again, uncheck the check box for **Beta: Use Unicode UTF-8 for worldwide language support** and restart your computer.
<br> This step is recommended to avoid potential compatibility issues between the beta option and the applications installed on your computer.
