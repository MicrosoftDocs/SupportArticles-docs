# Prevent mailbox delegates from reading protected messages

By default for a user mailbox, Information Rights Management (IRM)-protected email messages can be read by any delegate who has Full Access permission on the mailbox.

By default for a shared mailbox, if either of the following conditions are true, IRM-protected email messages can be read by any delegate who has Full Access permission on the mailbox:

- The delegate opens the message in the new Outlook, Outlook on the web, Outlook for Android, or Outlook for iOS.
- The delegate opens the message in the classic Outlook, and [automapping](/powershell/module/exchange/add-mailboxpermission#-automapping) is enabled on the shared mailbox.

## Block delegate access to protected messages

In some scenarios, a delegate who has the Full Access permission on a mailbox can be prevented from reading IRM-protected email messages that are received in the mailbox. Use the following table to determine the appropriate prevention method for each scenario. For more information, see the method descriptions that follow the table.

||Delegate uses the classic Outlook|Delegate uses the new Outlook|Delegate uses Outlook on the web, Outlook for Android, or Outlook for iOS|
|---|---|---|---|
|**User mailbox in Exchange Online**|Methods A or B|Method C|Method C|
|**Shared mailbox in Exchange Online**|No prevention possible|Method C|Method C|
|**User mailbox in Exchange Server**|Methods A or B|Invalid scenario|No prevention possible|
|**Shared mailbox in Exchange Server**|No prevention possible|Invalid scenario|No prevention possible|

### Method A

To restrict delegate access in the applicable scenarios, senders can apply either the [Encrypt-Only](/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#encrypt-only-option-for-emails) or [Do Not Forward](/azure/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#do-not-forward-option-for-emails) built-in protection option to new messages. This approach restricts the delegates who can read a protected message to those who are specified in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** fields of the message.

### Method B

To restrict delegate access in the applicable scenarios, senders can [apply a sensitivity label](/purview/encryption-sensitivity-labels#how-to-configure-a-label-for-encryption) that assigns either the **Encrypt-Only** or **Do Not Forward** protection option to new messages. This approach restricts the delegates who can read a protected message to those who are specified in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** fields of the message. For information about how an admin can create this type of sensitivity label, see [Configure encryption](/purview/encryption-sensitivity-labels#configure-encryption-settings).

> [!NOTE]
> If senders instead apply a sensitivity label that [assigns access rights to predetermined users or groups](/purview/encryption-sensitivity-labels#assign-permissions-now), any of those users or group members can read the protected message, even if they aren't specified in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** fields of the message.

### Method C

To restrict delegate access in the applicable scenarios, run the [Set-MailboxIRMAccess](/powershell/module/exchange/set-mailboxirmaccess) cmdlet in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell). For more information, see [Block delegates or shared mailbox members from accessing protected messages](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/consistently-block-delegates-or-shared-mailbox-members-from/ba-p/3473764).
