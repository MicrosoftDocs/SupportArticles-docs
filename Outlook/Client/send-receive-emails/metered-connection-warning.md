## Workaround

If you cannot install the update mentioned in the 'Resolution' section, or if you are running Outlook 2013, you can work around this issue by using one of the following methods:
### Method 1: Verify permissions in the registry

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, back up the registry for restoration in case problems occur.

In some cases, this problem is related to a permissions issue in the registry. To determine whether this is the cause of the issue and to fix it, follow these steps:

1. Exit Outlook.   
2. Start **Registry Editor**. To do this, use one of the following procedures, as appropriate for your version of Windows:   
   - **Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8**: Press Windows Key + R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type **regedit.exe** and then click **OK**.   
   - **Windows 7**: Click **Start**, type **regedit.exe** in the search box, and then press **Enter**.   

3. In Registry Editor, locate and right-click the following subkey in the registry, and then click Permissions:

    **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Components\F1291BD604B860441AB89E60BDEE0F9C**

4. Under Group or user names, find your own user name or a group that you're a member of (such as Users or Administrators).

    If you're unsure about which groups your user account is a member of, follow these steps:   
   - Open **Control Panel**.   
   - From **Category** view, click **User Accounts**, and then click **User Accounts** again.   
   - Click **Manage User Accounts**.   
   - In the **User Accounts** window, find your **User Name**, and review the groups that are listed in the **Group** column.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may have to expand the **Group** column to view all the groups.   
   - Click **Cancel** when finished.

5. If you do not see your own user name or a group that you're a member of listed in the permissions, click **Add**, and then add your own user account.   
6.Click **OK**.   
7. Select your user name or the group that you're a member of.   
8. View the permissions for your user or group, and make sure that the **Read** permission has **Allow** selected.   
9. Click **OK**.   
10. Exit Registry Editor.   

### Method 2: Run a repair of Office
