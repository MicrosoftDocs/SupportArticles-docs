# Email stays in the Outbox folder until you manually initiate a send/receive operation in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2797572

## Symptoms

When you send an e-mail message in Microsoft Outlook, the message may remain in your Outbox folder as shown in the following figure.

When this problem occurs, the message remains in your Outbox folder until you manually initiate a Send/Receive operation (for example, press F9 or select send or receive).

## Cause

This problem can occur if the **Send immediately when connected** option is not enabled, as shown in the following figure from Outlook 2016.

:::image type="content" source="media/email-stays-in-outbox-until-manually-send-or-receive/send-immediately-when-connected-setting.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Outlook Options window, where Send immediately when connected option is highlighted in Send and receive area." border="false":::

This setting is tied to the following registry data, so this setting can also be configured by an administrator through a modification of the registry.

Key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office<x.0>\Outlook\Options\Mail`

or

Policy key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office<x.0>\Outlook\Options\Mail`

DWORD: Send Mail Immediately  
Value: 0

> [!NOTE]
> In the above registry key paths, <x.0> represents the Outlook version (16.0 = Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, or Outlook for Microsoft 365, 15.0 = Outlook 2013, 14.0 = Outlook 2010, 12.0 = Outlook 2007, 11.0 = Outlook 2003).

## Resolution

Use the following steps to re-enable the Send immediately when connected option.

- Outlook 2010 and later versions
  1. On the **File** tab, select **Options**.
  2. In the **Outlook Options** dialog box, select **Advanced**.
  3. In the **Send and receive** section, enable **Send immediately when connected**.
  4. Select **OK**.

- Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2003
  1. On the **Tools** menu, select **Options**.
  2. In the **Options** dialog box, select the **Mail Setup** tab.
  3. In the **Send/Receive** section, enable **Send immediately when connected**.
  4. Select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are unable to re-enable this setting because it is grayed out, then the setting is being managed by group policy. In this situation, contact your administrator to have this group policy removed.
