# Offline item count for a folder in Outlook differs from the server item count

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3044375

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook, you discover that the server count and offline item count for a particular folder do not match. The following screen shot illustrates this issue.

In this example, Server folder contains 39 items and Offline folder contains 2 items." border="false":::

## Cause

This issue occurs when a synchronization filter is configured for a folder.

## Resolution

If you no longer require the filter or if you did not mean to enable it in the first place, follow these steps to remove the filter:

1. In the **details** pane in Outlook, right-click the folder, and then select **Properties**.
2. Select the **Synchronization** tab, and then select **Filter**.
3. Select **Clear All**, or adjust the filter criteria as needed.

> [!NOTE]
> The changes will not be applied until the next Send/Receive operation in Outlook.

## More information

Be aware that while Outlook is in Offline mode, the synchronization filter process does not work.
