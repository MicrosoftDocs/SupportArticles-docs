## Summary

Microsoft Outlook supports the logging of the communications that occur between Outlook and various types of email servers. These logs can be helpful when you troubleshoot problems that affect the transfer of messages between Outlook and the email server. 

Outlook can log the communications among Microsoft Exchange, Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP), Internet Messaging Access Protocol (IMAP), and Outlook.com servers.

- Subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Options\Mail    
- DWORD: EnableLogging    
- Value: 1    
- Subkey: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Office Outlook Connector    
- DWORD: TracingLevel    
- Value: 3

#### Logging results
 
When you enable logging, the following registry data is configured.

Subkey: **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\1x.0\Outlook\Options\Mail**

DWORD: EnableLogging
 
Values: 1 = logging enabled, 0 = logging disabled

> [!NOTE]
> In the subkey, <1x.0> represents the program version number ("16.0" = Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016 or Outlook for Office 365, "15.0" = Outlook 2013, "14.0" = Outlook 2010, "12.0" = Outlook 2007).

After you enable logging, all communications that occur between Outlook and the email server are written to a log file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must disable logging after the logs capture the failed communication to the server. If you do not disable logging, the logs continue to grow indefinitely.
