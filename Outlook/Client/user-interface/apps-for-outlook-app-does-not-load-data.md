> [!NOTE]
> This image shows an example of the issue in the Bing Maps app. However, other apps may also be affected.

## Cause

This problem occurs if the following registry data exists on the Outlook client:

Subkey:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<x.0>\Common\Internet`

or

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\<x.0>\Common\Internet`

DWORD: **UseOnlineContent**  
Value: **0** or **1**  

0 = Do not allow user to access Office 2013 resources on the Internet
1 = Allow user to opt in to access of Office 2013 resources on the Internet

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the subkey path, the **x.0** placeholder represents your version of Office (16.0 = Office 2016, 15.0 = Office 2013).

This issue prevents the app from obtaining data from the Internet.

> [!NOTE]
> This problem does not occur if the `UseOnlineContent` value is **2**, because 2 means *Use Office Online content whenever available*.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To resolve this issue, change the `UseOnlineContent` registry value data to **2**. To do this follow these steps.

1. Exit Outlook.
2. Start Registry Editor. To do this, use one of the following procedures, as appropriate for your version of Windows:

   - Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 8: Press Windows logo key+R to open a **Run** dialog box. Type *regedit.exe*, and then press **OK**.
   - Windows 7: Select **Start**, type *regedit.exe* in the **Start search** box, and then press **Enter**.

3. Type *regedit.exe*, and then press **Enter**.
4. Locate and then select the following registry subkey:

    `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<x.0>\Common\Internet\`

    > [!NOTE]
    > In the subkey path, the *x.0* placeholder represents your version of Office (16.0 = Office 2016, 15.0 = Office 2013).

5. Locate and then double-click the following value:

   `UseOnlineContent`
6. In the **Value Data** box, type *2*, and then select **OK**.
7. Exit Registry Editor.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `UseOnlineContent` value is located under the Policies hive, it may have been created through Group Policy. In this case, your administrator will have to modify the policy to change this setting.
