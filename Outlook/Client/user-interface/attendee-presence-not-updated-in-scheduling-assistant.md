# Attendee's presence isn't updated in the Outlook Scheduling Assistant

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2964694

## Symptoms

An attendee's presence isn't automatically updated in the Outlook Scheduling Assistant in Microsoft Outlook 2013.

For example, after you create a new meeting or appointment, you open the item and view it from inside the Scheduling Assistant. If one of the meeting or appointment attendees changes their presence from **Available** to **Busy**, that change will not be reflected in the UI.

## Cause

This is a known problem in Outlook 2013.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, hover your mouse pointer over the presence pawn or jelly bean. This will cause the presence data to update.

## More information

This problem occurs when you use any instant messaging client, regardless of version.
