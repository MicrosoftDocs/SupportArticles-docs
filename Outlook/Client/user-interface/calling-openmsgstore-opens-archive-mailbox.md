# Calling OpenMsgStore in Outlook opens the archive mailbox instead of the primary mailbox

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- An Extended MAPI application calls OpenMsgStore to open the primary mailbox for a user.
- The same application then calls OpenMsgStore to open the archive mailbox for the same user.

In this scenario, all subsequent OpenMsgStore calls to open the primary mailbox will open the archive mailbox instead.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Autodiscover service returns the primary SMTP address in the AutoDiscoverSMTPAddress XML element for both the primary mailbox and the archive mailbox.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, clear the contents of the **%localappdata%\Microsoft\Outlook\16** folder when the OpenMsgStore call is completed.

## More Information

The Outlook client performs an Autodiscover lookup when OpenMsgStore is called. The Autodiscover results are saved in the local file system for future use by Outlook and Extended MAPI clients.

The name of the cached Autodiscover results file contains the AutoDiscoverSMTPAddress XML element value. This value is returned by the Autodiscover service.

For both the primary mailbox and the archive mailbox, the Autodiscover service returns the primary SMTP address in the AutoDiscoverSMTPAddress XML element.
