# You can't assign color categories for IMAP accounts in Outlook 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4498585

## Symptoms

You can't set color categories on email items that are associated with an IMAP email account in Microsoft Outlook 2016.

## Cause

The ability to assign color categories is not available for IMAP email accounts in Outlook 2016. This is a limitation of the color categories feature.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, add your email account as a POP3 account. POP3 accounts do support assigning color categories.

Alternatively, if you are using an Outlook.com or Microsoft 365 email account, see [Add an email account to Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-an-email-account-to-outlook-6e27792a-9267-4aa4-8bb6-c84ef146101b) to make sure that you connect in a manner that provides the full benefits of those accounts.
