# Can't open an attachment in Outlook by double-clicking it

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3106898

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook 2016, Outlook 2019, and Outlook for Microsoft 365, when you double-click an attachment to open it, the file does not open. However, you can right-click the attachment and then select **Open** to open it.

## Cause

This issue may occur when the setting for the double-click speed for your mouse is too fast.

## Resolution

Change the double-click speed setting to a slower setting:

1. In Control Panel, select the **Mouse** item.

   If **Mouse** does not appear in Control Panel, type *mouse* in the search box, and then select **Change mouse settings**.

2. On the **Buttons** tab, slide the **Double-click speed** slider to the left, and then select **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> Sliding the **Double-click speed** slider one step to the left is typically sufficient to fix this issue. However, if the issue still occurs, you may have to slide it further.
