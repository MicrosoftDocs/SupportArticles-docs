# Skype for Business can't save conversation history or show voice mail

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4099000

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Skype for Business, you experience one of the following issues:

- Conversation history of the Skype for Business client can' t be saved in the Outlook client.
- You can't see the option for voice mails in the Skype for Business client.

Additionally, you may receive the following error message:

> The Exchange server won't let us connect.  We're working on fixing the connection.  Your history, voice mail and Outlook features might be unavailable.

## Cause

This behavior occurs because the size of the item that is being read from the Deleted Items folder exceeds the quota of 1048576 (0x100000) bytes.

## Resolution

Navigate to **Outlook Client** > **Deleted Items** to check if there are subfolders under Deleted Items. If there are, remove them and try again.
