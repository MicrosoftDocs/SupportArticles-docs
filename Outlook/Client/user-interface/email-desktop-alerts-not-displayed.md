# Email desktop alerts (toast notifications) aren't displayed in Outlook on Windows Server 2012

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3182782

## Symptoms

When you have Microsoft Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 running as a RemoteApp in Windows Server 2012, you don't receive new email desktop alerts (toast notifications) as expected.

## Cause

New email desktop alerts are created by explorer.exe. In a RemoteApp session, explorer.exe doesn't exist. Therefore, it can't create alerts.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Outlook when it's running as a RemoteApp in Windows Server 2012.
