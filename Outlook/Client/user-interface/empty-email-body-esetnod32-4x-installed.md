# Emails have empty bodies when ESET NOD32 4.x is installed on client machines on Exchange Server 2010

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2253312

## Symptoms

Some users on Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 may experience a problem, where they receive emails with blank content. The From: address, and subject will be present, but there will be nothing contained in the body of the message.  

This issue only applies to users on Exchange 2010, who are using Outlook Web App (OWA) or Outlook as a client, and also have ESET NOD32 4.x antivirus installed and run on their client machines.

## Resolution

## More information

If you enable pipeline tracing on the Exchange 2010 server, you'll find that the email has body content until it's delivered to the mailbox.
