# Items placed in root folder seem to be lost in Outlook

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2979451

## Symptoms

When you move items to the root folder of your mailbox, you cannot see the items in either the Folder List or the Outlook Today pane.

> [!NOTE]
> The root folder in your Outlook mailbox is the folder at the top of your folder list. In Outlook 2010 and later versions the root folder is displayed as your email address, and in Outlook 2007 the root folder is displayed as **Mailbox - username**. In the following figure the root folder is displayed as `e15user1@wingtiptoys.com`.

## Cause

By default, Microsoft Outlook replaces the root folder of the default messaging store with the Outlook Today feature. Therefore, when you select it you cannot see any items that you placed in the folder as the Outlook Today feature is displayed.

## Resolution Method 1 - Disable Outlook Today

To disable Outlook Today, follow these steps for your version of Outlook:

### Outlook 2010 and later versions

1. Right-click the root folder and select **Data File Properties**.
2. Select the **Home Page** tab.
3. Clear **Show home page by default for this folder**, and then select **OK**.

4. Select the root folder to view the contents.

### Outlook 2007

1. Right-click the root folder and select **Properties for "Mailbox - username"**.

2. Select the **Home Page** tab.

4. Select the root folder to view the contents.

> [!NOTE]
> If you prefer, you can enable Outlook Today again after you move the items from the root folder to another folder.

## Resolution Method 2 - Use Advanced Find to locate the items and move them to a different folder
