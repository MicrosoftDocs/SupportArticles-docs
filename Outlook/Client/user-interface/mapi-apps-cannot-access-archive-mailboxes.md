# MAPI applications cannot access archive mailboxes in Recovery Databases

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2590306

If you develop an Extended MAPI application for use with Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, the application can't access an archive mailbox in a Recovery Database (RDB).

## More information

This is a design limitation of Exchange Server 2010. MAPI applications can't access an archive mailbox in an RDB because of the design of the RPC Client Access server role. When a MAPI application attempts to sign in, it will encounter a **MAPI_E_FAILONEPROVIDER (0x8004011d)** error. To work around this limitation, you can use the `Restore-Mailbox` cmdlet to restore data from the archive mailbox in the RDB.
