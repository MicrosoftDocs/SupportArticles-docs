# Outlook Message Manager (profile_name) (KEY hex_number) email items in an Exchange Online mailbox

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2937277

## Symptoms

When you use Microsoft Outlook to connect to a Microsoft 365 email account, one or more messages that have the following Subject line may appear in your Inbox:

Outlook Message Manager (**profile_name**) (KEY: *hex_number*)

The **profile_name** placeholder represents the name of your Outlook messaging profile, and **hex_number** represents a hexadecimal string that consists of a combination of numbers and letters from A-F.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue occurs only when your Outlook messaging profile has the Exchange email account set up to use Online mode.

## More information

You can safely move these messages to the **Deleted Items** folder.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
