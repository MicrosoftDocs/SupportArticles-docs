# Access public folders in Outlook for Windows

In the redesigned user interface in Microsoft Outlook, you see that:

- The horizontal navigation bar that was at the bottom of the **Folders** view is now a left-side vertical navigation bar.

- The ellipsis icon on the horizontal navigation bar is now a **More Apps** icon on the vertical navigation bar.

To access public folders in the updated design, select **More Apps** \> **Folders**.

When you select **Folders**, the navigation bar shows a **Folders** icon. To permanently pin the **Folders** icon to the navigation bar, right-click the icon, and then select **Pin**.

## Access public folders in new Outlook for Windows

If your Microsoft Outlook app was updated to the new Outlook for Windows, you need to add public folders to **Favorites** before you can access them. Use the following steps:

1. Right-click the name of the account and select **Add public folder to Favorites**.

   **Notes**:
   - If you don't see this option, make sure that public folders are deployed in your tenant.
   - If public folders are deployed but you don't see the option, ask an administrator to check the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://aka.ms/pfcte) for troubleshooting steps.
1. In the pane that displays the public folder hierarchy, expand **All Public Folders**.

1. Select the public folder that you want to add to **Favorites** and then select **Add Public Folder**.

1. After the public folder is added, select it from the list of **Favorites** to access it.
