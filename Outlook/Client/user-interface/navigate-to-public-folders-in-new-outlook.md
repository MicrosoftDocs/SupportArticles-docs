# Navigate to public folders in new Outlook for Windows

If your Microsoft Outlook app was updated to the new Outlook for Windows, you'll see that:

- The horizontal navigation bar that was at the bottom of the **Folders** view is now a left-side vertical navigation bar.

- The ellipsis icon on the horizontal navigation bar is now a **More Apps** icon on the vertical navigation bar.

To access public folders in the new design, select **More Apps** \> **Folders**.

When you select **Folders**, the navigation bar shows a **Folders** icon. To permanently pin the **Folders** icon to the navigation bar, right-click the icon, and then select **Pin**.
