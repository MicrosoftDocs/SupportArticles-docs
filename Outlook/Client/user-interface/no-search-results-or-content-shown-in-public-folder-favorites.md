# No search results or content displayed in public folder favorites in Outlook 2016

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3169741

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook 2016, you experience one of the following symptoms:

- When you search in a public folder that you have added to your favorites, no search results are returned.
- No content is displayed in a public folder that you have added to your favorites.

## Cause

This issue can occur when the option to download public folder favorites is enabled.

## Resolution

This issue is fixed in Current Channel build 16.0.7766.2060, which was released on February 23, 2017. For more information, see [Update history for Microsoft 365 Apps (listed by date)](/officeupdates/update-history-microsoft365-apps-by-date).

## Workaround

To work around this issue until the fix of Deferred Channel is available, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1 - Do not cache public folder favorites

1. In Outlook, on the **File** tab, select **Account Settings**, and then select **Account Settings**.
2. Select the Microsoft Exchange account, and then select **Change**.
3. Select **More Settings**.
4. On the **Advanced** tab, clear the **Download Public Folder Favorites** check box.
5. Select **OK**, select **Next**, select **Finish**, and then select **Close**.
6. Exit and restart Outlook.

### Method 2 - Remove public folders from your favorites

1. In Outlook, open your Folders list. To do this, select the ellipsis (**...**) in the navigation pane, and then select **Folders**.
2. Expand **Public Folders**, and then expand **Favorites**.
3. Right-click the public folder that is listed under **Favorites**, and then select **Delete Folder**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Selecting **Delete Folder** does not delete the folder from the server. This action only removes the folder from your favorites.

4. Repeat step 3 for any public folders that you want to remove from your favorites.

### Method 3 - Revert the Office 2016 Click-to-Run installation to an earlier version

This method is a workaround for the symptom of content not being displayed in the public folder favorites folder and is not meant for the symptom of no search results.

> [!NOTE]
> To determine whether your Office installation is Click-to-Run or MSI-based, see the More Information section.

Revert the Office 2016 Click-to-Run installation to the 16.0.7070.2036 version. To do this, follow these steps.

1. Exit all Office applications.
2. Open an elevated command prompt as administrator.

    Windows 10

      1. Go to **Start**, enter **Run** in the **Search Windows** box, and then press Enter.
      2. Type *cmd* in the **Run** box, and then select **OK**.

    Windows 8 and Windows 8.1

    1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then select **Search**. If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then select **Search**.
    2. Enter **Run**.
    3. Type *cmd* in the **Run** box, and then select **OK**.

    Windows 7 SP1

    1. Select **Start**, type *cmd* in the **Start Search** box.
    2. Right-click **Command Prompt** or cmd.exe, and then select **Run as administrator**.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```console
    cd %programfiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun
    ```

4. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

    ```console
    officec2rclient.exe /update user updatetoversion=16.0.7070.2036
    ```

5. When the repair dialog box appears, select **Online Repair**.
6. Select **Repair**, and then select **Repair** again.
7. After the repair is complete, start Outlook.
8. Select **File**, and then select **Office Account**.
9. In the **Product Information** column, select **Update Options**, and then select **Disable Updates**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This step is very important. The repair process re-enables automatic updates. To prevent the newest version of Office Click-to-Run from being automatically reinstalled, make sure that you follow this step.

10. Set a reminder in your calendar for a future date at which to check this article for a resolution for this issue. Enable automatic updates in Office again after this issue is fixed. Enabling automatic updates again will make sure that you don't miss future updates.
