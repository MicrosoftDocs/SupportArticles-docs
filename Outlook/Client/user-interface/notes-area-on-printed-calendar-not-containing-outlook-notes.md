# Notes area on a printed calendar does not contain Outlook notes

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 252687

## Symptoms

When you choose to print the Notes section in a calendar, the printed area does not include any notes that are in your Notes folder, or the Notes fields in any of the appointment or meeting items in the Calendar folder.

## Cause

The Notes section on the printed calendar is for hand-written notes.

## More information

To print the Notes section from a calendar, follow these steps:

1. Select the Calendar folder on the **Folder List**.

   If you do not see the Folder List, on the **View** menu, select **Folder List**.

2. Select the **File** menu, and then select **Print**.
3. In the **Print style** section, select **Daily**, **Weekly**, **Monthly**, or **Tri-Fold Style**.
4. Select the **Page Setup** button.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The option to print the Notes section is not available if you select Memo Style or Calendar Details Style.

5. Select the **Format** tab. Under **Options**, select the **Notes area (blank)** check box, or the **Notes area (lined)** check box, and then select **Print**.
