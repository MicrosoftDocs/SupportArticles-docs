# You can open only two identically named Excel attachments from different email messages

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- In Microsoft Outlook, you receive several email messages.
- All the messages have Microsoft Excel workbook attachments.
- All the attached files have different content.
- All the attached files have the same file name.

In this scenario, you can open only two of the attachments by using Excel.

## Workaround

Avoid sending email messages that have Excel attachments that share the same file name.
