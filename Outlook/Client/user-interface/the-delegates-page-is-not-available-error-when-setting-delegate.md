# The delegates page is not available error when setting a delegate in Outlook 2010 or 2007

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2753709

## Symptoms

Assume that you do one of the following:

- You select the **Delegate Access** button on the **Account Settings** menu in Microsoft Outlook 2010.
- You select the **Delegates** tab in the **Options** dialog box in Microsoft Office Outlook 2007.

In this situation, you receive the following error messages:

> The delegates page is not available. Cannot access Outlook folder. The connection to Microsoft Exchange is unavailable. Outlook must be online or connected to complete this action.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue occurs in a Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 environment.

## Cause

This issue occurs because an account attribute in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) references the value of a deleted object. For example, the account attribute references CN=Deleted Objects.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, remove the value of the deleted object in the affected account attribute by using the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) Edit tool.

> [!NOTE]
> To identify which value belongs to the deleted object in the account attribute, follow these steps:
>
> 1. Copy the value of the distinguishedName attribute of the affected account by using the ADSI Edit tool.
> 2. Export an .ldf file. To do this, use the value that you copied to run the following command in an elevated command prompt (cmd.exe):  
> Ldifde -f **drive**:\\**filename**.ldf -d "**distinguishedName value**"  
> 3. Open the .ldf file in an application such Notepad.
> 4. Type CN=Deleted Objects in the Find function.
