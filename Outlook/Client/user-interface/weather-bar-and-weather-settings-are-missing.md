# Weather Bar and Weather settings missing in Outlook 2019, 2016, 2013, or Outlook for Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2975407

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook LTSC 2021, Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, Outlook, 2013 or Outlook for Microsoft 365, the Weather Bar does not appear above the calendar. Also, the Weather settings are not displayed in the Calendar section of Outlook Options.

## Cause

This behavior will occur if the option to allow Office to connect to online services is disabled.

## Resolution

To restore the Weather Bar settings and functionality, follow these steps to enable the option to allow Office to connect to online services:

1. In Outlook, from the **File** tab, select **Options**.
2. Select **Trust Center**, and then select **Trust Center Settings**.

3. Select **Privacy Options**, and then enable the following setting depending on your version of Outlook:
   - Outlook LTSC 2021, Outlook 2019, Outlook 2016, or Outlook for Microsoft 365: Let Office connect to online services from Microsoft to provide functionality that's relevant to your usage and preferences.
   - Outlook 2013: Allow Office to connect to the Internet.

4. Select **OK** twice.

> [!NOTE]
> If the Allow Office to connect to the Internet checkbox is grayed out, see the More information section below for additional details on this setting.

## More information

The setting documented in the Resolution section corresponds to the following registry value:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\<x.0>\Common\Internet`

or

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\<x.0>\Common\Internet`

DWORD: UseOnlineContent  
Value:

This option can also be configured by using a Group Policy setting. This Group Policy setting is located here:

Group Policy Setting path: **Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 20\<xx>\Tools \| Options \| General \| Service Options...**
