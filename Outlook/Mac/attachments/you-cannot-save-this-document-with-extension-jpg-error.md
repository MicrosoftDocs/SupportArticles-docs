# A message is shown about the file name extension when saving a .jpg file attachment

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2788325

## More information

When you try to save a file attachment that has a .jpg file name extension, you receive the following message:

:::image type="content" source="media/you-cannot-save-this-document-with-extension-jpg-error/error-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the error message when saving the .jpg file attachment." border="false":::

If you select either **Use both** or **Use .jpeg**, the file that is saved uses a .jpeg extension. This process does not affect the image quality of the JPEG image. This process only changes the file name extension from .jpg to .jpeg.

> [!NOTE]
> When multiple .jpg files are attached to a message, if you use the **Save All** option, you do not see this message. When you use this option, all the files that are saved have a .jpeg file name extension.
