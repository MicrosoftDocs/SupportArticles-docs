# Can't move meetings between calendars in Outlook for Mac

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2803557

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Outlook for Mac, you can't move a meeting by dragging it from one calendar to another. Also, there is no **Move** or **Copy** option to move meetings from one calendar to another.

## Cause

If you move a meeting from one calendar to another, the action might trigger discrepancies between your instance of the meeting and the information that the meeting organizer or other attendees have. In such a scenario, you might miss important updates sent by the meeting organizer. Hence this functionality isn't supported in Outlook for Mac.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, forward the meeting to the account associated with the calendar to which you want to move the meeting.

## More information

Although you can't move meetings between calendars, you can move appointments between calendars. This is because a meeting is a calendar item that has attendees, while an appointment is a calendar item that doesn't have any attendees and is only on your calendar.
