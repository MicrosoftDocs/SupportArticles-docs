# You can't move a meeting between calendars in Outlook for Mac

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2803557

You can't use Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011 to move a meeting by dragging it from one calendar to another. Also, there is no **Move** or **Copy** option available to move meetings from one calendar to another.

## Cause

This functionality isn't supported by Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011. Moving a meeting from one calendar to another might trigger discrepancies between your instance of the meeting and the information that the meeting organizer or other attendees have. In such a scenario, you might miss important updates sent by the meeting organizer.

## Workaround 

To work around this issue, forward the meeting to the account that you want the calendar item to be moved to.

## More information

While you cannot move meetings between calendars, you can move appointments in this manner. A Meeting is a calendar item that has attendees, while an Appointment is a calendar item that does not have any attendees and is on your Calendar only.
