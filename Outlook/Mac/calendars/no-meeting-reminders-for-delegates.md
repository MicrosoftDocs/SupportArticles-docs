# No meeting reminders for delegates

## Symptoms 

As a delegate, on behalf of a mailbox owner, you use the new Outlook for Mac, Outlook for iOS, or Outlook for Android to create a meeting that has a reminder. However, when you view the meeting in the shared calendar of the mailbox owner, the value in the meeting **Reminder** field is `None`. If the mailbox owner views the meeting in their calendar, the **Reminder** value is set correctly.

## Workaround 

To work around the issue as a delegate, use Outlook on the web or the new Outlook for Windows to create meetings that have reminders.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this issue and will update this article when more information becomes available.
