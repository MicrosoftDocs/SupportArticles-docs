# Add Exchange Server mailboxes in the new Outlook for Mac

In the new Outlook for Mac, you can add email accounts for Microsoft Exchange Server mailboxes. This feature is fully supported and available for all users. To use this feature, ensure your environment must meet the following requirements:

- The on-premises mailboxes must be in Exchange Server 2016 or a later version.

- Communication between the new Outlook for Mac client and Exchange Server must use either [NTLM](/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/authentication-and-ews-in-exchange#ntlm-authentication) or [Basic](/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/authentication-and-ews-in-exchange#basic-authentication) authentication.

  > Note: The new Outlook for Mac doesn't support Kerberos or Certificate authentication. For more information about currently supported Exchange Server features in the new Outlook for Mac, see [Supported features for Exchange on-premises](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/the-new-outlook-for-mac-6283be54-e74d-434e-babb-b70cefc77439#bkmk_exchangeonprem).

- Outlook or Office must be licensed through a volume license, or an enterprise or business Microsoft 365 subscription plan.

- Outlook or Office must be downloaded from the Microsoft 365 portal ([https://office.com](https://office.com/)).

  Note: The Outlook and Office versions that are downloaded from the Apple App Store don't support the new functionality.
