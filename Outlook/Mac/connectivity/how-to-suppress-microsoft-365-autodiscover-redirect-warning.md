# How to suppress the Microsoft 365 AutoDiscover redirect warning in Outlook 2016 for Mac

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3206915

## Symptoms

When Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac connects to a Microsoft 365 account, Autodiscover is redirected from HTTP to HTTPS, and you may receive a warning message that resembles the following:

> Outlook was redirected to the server `Autodiscover-s.outlook.com` to get new settings for your account `user@domain.com`. Do you want to allow this server to configure your settings?  
> `https://autodiscover-s.outlook.com/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml`  
> Click Allow only if you fully trust the source, or if your Exchange administrator instructs you to.

When this warning message occurs, you may select **Always use my response for this server** and then select **Allow** in order not to be asked about this specific server again for this Outlook 2016 for Mac profile.

You or administrators may want to suppress the initial warning message. This article contains information about how to do this.

## Resolution

Install the December 13, 2016 update for Outlook 2016 for Mac (version 15.29.0) or a later update, and then follow the steps to configure the Outlook 2016 for Mac Autodiscover redirect warning behavior when you connect to Microsoft 365.

For information about this update or to download the Outlook update package, see:

1. Quit Outlook if it's running.

   - In Spotlight Search, type *Terminal*, and then double-click **Terminal** from the search results.

3. Enter the following command in the **Terminal** window, and then press Enter.
