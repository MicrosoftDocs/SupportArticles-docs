# Outlook 2016 for Mac crashes when a Proxy Auto Configuration file is used

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You use Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac on a Mac computer that's configured to use a Proxy Auto Configuration (PAC) file.
- You try to access a remote resource by using the HTTP protocol.

In this scenario, Outlook 2016 for Mac crashes.

## Cause

This issue occurs when a file-based PAC file is used in the **Automatic Proxy Configuration** setting in Mac operating system.

> [!NOTE]
> A file-based PAC file is a file whose URL begins with ***file://***.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, host the PAC file on a web server that can be accessed by using the HTTP protocol, and then specify the URL of the file in the **Automatic Proxy Configuration** setting of the **Advanced** **Network** preferences in Mac operating system.

To edit the Automatic Proxy Configuration settings in Mac operating system, follow these steps:

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Select **Network**.
3. Select **Advanced**.
4. Select the **Proxies** tab.
5. Under **Select a protocol to configure**, select **Automatic Proxy Configuration**.
6. Enter the URL of the hosted PAC file.
