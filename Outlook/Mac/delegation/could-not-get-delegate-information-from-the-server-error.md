_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2742644

## Symptoms

When this error occurs, you cannot make any changes to your delegate settings or view your current delegates.

## Cause

This issue can occur when there is an invalid user who was added as a delegate, such as a user account that was removed from your organization.

## Resolution

Remove this invalid user account from your delegates in Outlook for Windows.

1. Configure your user account in Outlook for Windows, such as Outlook 2010 or 2013.
2. On the **File** tab, select **Account Settings** > **Delegate Access**.
3. Look for a delegate who displays **(Not Found)**.
4. Select this invalid delegate, then select **Remove**.
