## Symptoms

In Outlook 2016 for Mac, when you navigate to a folder in which several encrypted email messages are displayed in the message list, Outlook freezes or experiences other performance issues.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, update Outlook 2016 for Mac to version 15.23 or a later version. Then, disable the preview feature for encrypted email messages by running a command in Terminal. To do this, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Check the Outlook for Mac version number

1. On the Outlook menu, select **About Outlook**.
2. View the version number that is listed.
3. If your Outlook installation is not at version 15.23 or a later version, install the June 14, 2016, update for Outlook 2016 for Mac or a later update.

### Step 2: Disable the preview feature

2. Open **Terminal** by using one of the following methods:

   - Make sure that **Finder** is the selected application, select **Utilities** on the **Go** menu, and then double-click **Terminal**.
   - In **Spotlight Search**, type *Terminal*, and then double-click **Terminal** in the search results.

3. Type the following commands in **Terminal**, and press Enter after each line:

    ```console
    defaults write com.microsoft.Outlook DisablePreviewForSMIME 1

    killall cfprefsd
    ```

4. Exit **Terminal**.
