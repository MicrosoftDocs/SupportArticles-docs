# Outlook for Mac cannot import an ANSI .pst file

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2632329

## Symptoms

When you try to import a .pst file into Microsoft Outlook 2016 for Mac or Outlook for Mac 2011, you receive one of the following errors depending on your version of Outlook for Mac:

Outlook 2016 for Mac:

> There's something wrong with this file. Please try another file.

Outlook for Mac 2011:

> The Data File could not be imported. This Outlook Data File is saved in ANSI format, which cannot be imported by Outlook for Mac.

:::image type="content" source="media/cannot-import-ansi-pst-file/import-incomplete.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Import Incomplete warning details.":::

## Cause

The .pst file is saved in the 97-2002 format, ANSI, that Outlook for Mac does not support.

## Workaround

Open the .pst file in Microsoft Outlook 2010, and move the contents to a new .pst file that is saved in Unicode format. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Outlook 2010, and select **File**, **Open**, **Open Outlook Data File**.
2. Browse to and select the ANSI .pst file.
3. Select the ANSI .pst file root in the Navigation Pane.

4. Select **File**, select **Options**, and then select **Advanced**.
5. Select **Export**, and then select **Export to a file** and select **Next**.
6. Select **Outlook Data File (.pst)**, and select **Next**.
7. Make sure the root of the ANSI .pst file is selected, and that **Include subfolders** is enabled, and then select **Next**.
8. Select **Browse** to choose a location for the new .pst file to be created, and enter a file name for it, and select **OK**.
9. Select **Finish**, enter a password for the PST if you prefer (optional), and select **OK**.
10. This creates a Unicode PST file in the location that you specified, that you can later import into Outlook for Mac successfully.
11. Open Outlook for Mac, and import the .pst file.
