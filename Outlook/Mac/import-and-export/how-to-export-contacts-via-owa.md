# How to export contacts from Outlook 2011 for Mac to Exchange Online by using OWA in Microsoft 365

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2648667

## Summary

This step-by-step article describes how to export contacts from Microsoft Outlook 2011 for Mac to Microsoft Exchange Online by using Microsoft Outlook Web App in a Microsoft 365 environment.

## Symptoms

A user sets up a profile in Outlook 2011 for Mac to connect to their Exchange Online mailbox in Microsoft 365. However, external contacts aren't synced with Exchange Online. This occurs because external contacts must be exported from Outlook 2011 for Mac and then imported to Outlook Web App. However, the existing method to export contacts from Outlook 2011 for Mac is to use a text-delimited file, and this file type isn't supported in Microsoft 365.

## Resolution

To export contacts from Outlook 2011 for Mac to Exchange Online by using Outlook Web App, follow these steps.

### Step 1 - Export the contacts from Outlook 2011 for Mac

1. In Outlook 2011 for Mac, on the **File** menu, select **Export**.
2. In the Export Assistant, select **Contacts to a list (tab-delimited text)**, and then select the right arrow button.

   > This workbook contains features that will not work or may be removed if you save it in the selected file format. Do you want to continue?

5. Select **Continue**.

### Step 4 - Import the contacts to Outlook Web App

1. In Outlook Web App, on the **Options** menu, select **See All Options**.
2. On the right side, under **Shortcuts to other things you can do**, select **Import your contacts from an existing e-mail account**.
