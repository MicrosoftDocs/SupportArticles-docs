# "You cannot access this right now" error when saving items from Outlook for iOS to OneNote

On an Intune-managed iOS device, when you use the **Send to OneNote** add-in to save items from Microsoft Outlook for iOS to OneNote, you receive the following error message:

> You cannot access this right now

This error occurs because the add-in can't complete device authentication to satisfy the requirements of conditional access. Because the add-in uses the new Office add-in platform that is HTML and JavaScript-based, authentication doesn't work if conditional policies are used. Therefore, [WebView](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webview) between Outlook and OneNote fails.
