# Unable to open OneDrive on images using Sysprep

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4459304

## Symptoms

Users are unable to open OneDrive after joining a domain with Win10 images using SysPrep.

## How to fix devices with OneDrive incorrectly deployed

To fix devices that have OneDrive deployed incorrectly using a **syspreped** image:

1. Sign in to the machine as the user that's unable to start OneDrive.
2. [Download the latest build](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=844652) of OneDrive and reinstall it.

## How to correctly deploy OneDrive via sysprep

After you have completed all of your system prep activities but **before** actually running sysprep on the profile, complete the following steps:

1. Uninstall OneDrive `onedrivesetup.exe /uninstall`.
2. Add the following registry key:

    `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce`  
    `OneDriveSetup`=**C:\\\Windows\\\SysWOW64\\\OneDriveSetup.exe /thfirstsetup**

3. Run **sysprep**.
