# Restore the OneDrive Sharing settings in Microsoft 365 admin center

## Symptoms

When users select the user details in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/users), the **OneDrive Sharing** option is no longer available to them.

## Cause

This problem occurs if a user navigates to **User details** > **OneDrive** > **Sharing section** > **Manage external sharing** and clears the **Let people outside your organization access your site** check box.

## Resolution

To restore the **OneDrive Sharing** option, follow these steps:

1.	Find the user MySite URL. For example:
    > `https://m365x328152-my.sharepoint.com/personal/meganb_m365x328152_contoso_com`
 
2.	Run the following commands in the [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35588):

     ```powershell
     Connect-SPOService -Url https://m365x328152-admin.sharepoint.com/

     Set-SPOSite -Identity https://m365x328152-my.sharepoint.com/personal/meganb_m365x328152_contoso_com  -SharingCapability ExternalUserSharingOnly
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > In these commands, replace the URLs with the actual site URLs.
