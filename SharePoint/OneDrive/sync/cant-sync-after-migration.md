# OneDrive for Business can't sync after tenant migration

After a tenant-to-tenant migration, a User Principal Name (UPN) change, or a password update, OneDrive for Business might be unable to sync.

To resolve this issue, clear the cached credentials for OneDrive for Business using the following steps:

1. Sign out of OneDrive for Business.
1. Remove the following folders:
    - `%localappdata%/Microsoft/OneAuth`
    - `%localappdata%/Microsoft/IdentityCache`

1. Sign in to OneDrive for Business.
