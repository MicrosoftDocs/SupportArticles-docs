# "FSLogix_unsupported_environment" and OneDrive sync error on virtual machines

## Symptoms

On virtual machines that are configured by using FSLogix, the OneDrive sync client can't sync, and you receive the following error messages:

> OneDrive can't sync  
> Contact your system administrator for help.  
> Error code: FSLogix_unsupported_environment

Additionally, the OneDrive sync client closes after you close the error message window.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, [download and install the latest version of FSLogix](https://aka.ms/fslogix-latest) on all virtual machines that use the OneDrive sync client.

## More information

Administrators can use one of the following methods to check the version of FSLogix on virtual machines that are running in their environment.

### Check the version of FSLogix on multiple virtual machines

**Note:** The following PowerShell script is provided as is and isn't supported by Microsoft.

Use the [FSLogix Version Validation](https://aka.ms/FSLVersionScript) script.

### Check the version of FSLogix on one virtual machine

- Use the FSLogix FRX command-line tool:

  ```console
  C:\Program Files\FSLogix\Apps\frx.exe version
  ```

- Run the following PowerShell command to get the `InstallVersion` property of the FSLogix registry key:

  ```powershell
  (Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\FSLogix\Apps).InstallVersion
  ```

- Run the following PowerShell commands to get the version of Microsoft FSLogix Apps that's installed on the system:

  ```powershell
  $uninstallPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall"
  $appCheck = Get-ItemProperty -Path $uninstallPath\* | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -eq "Microsoft FSLogix Apps" }
  ($appCheck | Where-Object {$_.EstimatedSize -eq ($appCheck | Measure-Object -Maximum EstimatedSize).Maximum}).DisplayVersion
  ```
