# Error 0x8004de85 or 0x8004de8a when signing in to OneDrive

## Symptoms

When you try to sign in to Microsoft OneDrive, you can't sign in, and you receive error code 0x8004de85 or 0x8004de8a.

## Cause

This issue might occur if a problem is affecting your OneDrive account, such as a missing account, or a mismatch if you try to sign in to a personal Microsoft account by using the credentials for a work or school account (or vice-versa).

To resolve this issue, try the following solutions.

## Solution 1: Make sure that you're using the correct OneDrive account

Sign in to your [personal Microsoft account](https://account.live.com/reputationcheck) or [Microsoft 365 account](https://www.office.com/signin) to verify that there are no authentication issues. Then, check your OneDrive account by following these steps:

1. Select the **OneDrive** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/onedrive-icon.png":::) in the taskbar notification area.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might have to select the **Show hidden icons** arrow (:::image type="icon" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/arrow-icon.png":::) next to the notification area to see the **OneDrive** icon. If the icon doesn't appear, OneDrive might not be running. To start OneDrive, select **Start**, type *OneDrive* in the search box, and then select **OneDrive** in the search results.

2. Select **Help & Settings** (:::image type="icon" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/setting-icon.png":::), and then select **Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/onedrive-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the OneDrive window in which the settings icon and settings are highlighted.":::

3. On the **Account** tab, make sure that the correct or expected account is displayed. Otherwise, sign in to OneDrive by using the correct account.

## Solution 2: Reset OneDrive

To reset the OneDrive sync app, follow these steps:

1. In the taskbar notification area, right-click the **OneDrive** icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/onedrive-icon.png":::).
2. Select **Help & Settings** (:::image type="icon" source="media/sign-into-onedrive-error-0x8004de85-or-0x8004de8a/setting-icon.png":::), and then select **Quit OneDrive**.
3. Select the **Start** icon, enter *cmd*, right-click **Command Prompt** in the search results, and then select **Run as administrator**.  
4. Run the `%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset` command.
5. Restart the OneDrive sync app, and sign in by using your work or school account.

## Solution 3: Make sure that the account has a valid license assigned

Depending on how your organization purchased OneDrive for users, you might no longer have the assigned OneDrive license, or the license might be expired.

**Note** The following steps must be completed by your organization's Microsoft 365 administrator.

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/users), select **Users** > **Active users**.
2. Select the user who is experiencing the issue.  
3. In the user pane, select **Licenses and apps**.
4. Expand the **Licenses** section, and make sure that a OneDrive for Business license is assigned to the user.

> [!NOTE]
> If multiple users experience the issue, the subscription might be expired. To check the subscription status, open the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/subscriptions), and then select **Billing** > **Your products**.
