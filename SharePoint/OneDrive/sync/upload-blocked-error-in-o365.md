# "UPLOAD BLOCKED" error when you save OneDrive-synced files in Microsoft 365 apps

## Symptoms

You open and edit a Microsoft OneDrive-synced file in a Microsoft 365 app, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Microsoft Excel. When you try to save the file, you receive the following error message:

> UPLOAD BLOCKED: We couldn't verify you have the necessary permissions to upload the file.

## Cause

This issue occurs if you sign in to the Microsoft 365 app by using an account that doesn't have permission to upload files to OneDrive.

For example, you use the *user@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com* account to sync files to OneDrive. However, you sign in to the Microsoft 365 app by using the *user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com* account, and this account doesn't have permission to upload files to OneDrive. In this case, you receive the error message when you try to save the file to OneDrive.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, try the following methods in the given order. If one method doesn't fix the issue, try the next one.

### Method 1: Use the same account to sign in to the Microsoft 365 app and OneDrive

1. Select the OneDrive icon (:::image type="icon" source="media/upload-blocked-error-in-o365/onedrive-icon.png":::) in the taskbar notification area.
