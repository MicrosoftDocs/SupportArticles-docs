# (Upload blocked) error in Office 365 when users sync files with OneDrive from different tenants

## Symptoms

When you open or edit files in Office 365 Desktop applications, you receive the following error message: 

> UPLOAD BLOCKED: We couldn't verify you have the necessary permissions to upload the file. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/upload-blocked-error-in-o365/upload-blocked-error-in-o365.png" alt-text="Upload blocked error in Office365. ":::

## Cause

This message appears if two different accounts (for example, username@contoso.onmicrosoft.com being the primary account and username@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com) are used to sync files on two different tenants (such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com and fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com). The Office application is trying to save the changes by using the primary account. However, the application does not have permissions on the second tenant.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1.	Share the files with the primary account.
2.	Sign out of all accounts in Office, and sign back in by using only the account that has permissions to open and edit the document. 
3.	Pause file synchronization in OneDrive.
