# Email notifications aren't sent for scheduled data refresh failures in PowerPivot

You may encounter an issue that email notifications aren't sent for scheduled data refresh failures in PowerPivot workbooks in Power Pivot for SharePoint 2016.

This issue is caused by a bug in PowerPivot. This fix has been released in the **ENU\x64\spPowerPivot16.msi** file that is available in [Microsoft SQL Server 2016 SP2 Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56833).
