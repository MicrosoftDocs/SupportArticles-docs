You may encounter an issue that email notifications aren't sent for scheduled data refresh failures in PowerPivot workbooks in Power Pivot for SharePoint 2016.

This issue is caused by a bug in PowerPivot. This fix has been released in the **ENU\x64\spPowerPivot16.msi** file that is available in [Microsoft SQL Server 2016 SP2 Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56833).
