# "SetAuthContext need to be run as sysadmin" error in PowerPivot 

This article was written by [Zakir Haveliwala](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Zakir+H+-+MSFT), Senior Support Escalation Engineer.

## Symptoms

If you receive an error when interacting with a PowerPivot workbook in Microsoft SharePoint, you may see the following error from the PowerPivot Service in the SharePoint Unified Logging Service (ULS) log:

**EXCEPTION: System.ServiceModel.FaultException`1[System.ServiceModel.ExceptionDetail]: SetAuthContext need to be run as sysadmin.**

This error refers to the Administrator permission on the PowerPivot Analysis Service instance.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, add the PowerPivot System Service account that's running the PowerPivot service application in SharePoint as an Administrator by connecting to the PowerPivot Analysis Services instance in SQL Server Management Studio. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the instance, and then select **Properties**.
1. In the **Analysis Server Properties** dialog box, select **Security**, and then select **Add** to add the user.
