# "A schedule cannot be enabled for a workbook" when you try to schedule a data refresh by using PowerPivot

This article was written by [Zakir Haveliwala](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/Zakir+H+-+MSFT), Senior Support Escalation Engineer.

## Symptoms

When you try to schedule a data refresh on a PowerPivot workbook in Microsoft SharePoint 2016, you may see either of the following errors:

- > Sorry, something went wrong.
- > A schedule cannot be enabled for a workbook with no external data sources.

The SharePoint Unified Logging Service (ULS) logs may show the following error:

> UserProfileDBCache_WCFLogging :: ProfileDBCacheServiceClient.GetUserData threw exception: Access is denied.

This issue occurs when the account that's running the PowerPivot System Service in SharePoint (PowerPivot application pool) does not have permissions on the User Profile Service Application.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, add the required permissions with the following steps:

1. In **SharePoint Central Administration**, go to **Application Management** > **Manage service applications**, and then select **User Profile Service Application**. Then click **Administrators**.
