# Can't set value for "Hyperlink with formatting and constraints for publishing" column by using SharePoint 2013 workflow in SharePoint Online

## Problem

When you set a value for the **Hyperlink with formatting and constraints for publishing** column in Microsoft SharePoint Online, a SharePoint 2013 workflow is canceled. Additionally, you receive the following error message:

**The property PropertyName does not exist on type 'SP.Data.ListNameListItem'. Make sure to only use property names that are defined by the type.**

## Cause

The REST endpoint that the workflow uses is the following:

`https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteCol/_api/web/lists(guid'GUID')/Items(N)`

But it doesn't return the field valueâ€”for the **Hyperlink with formatting and constraints for publishing** field type.

This is a limitation of the underlying REST layer that currently cannot be changed.

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Method 1: Work on the column from the **hyperlink or picture** type for the links.
- Method 2: Update the **Hyperlink with formatting and constraints for publishing** column value by using a SharePoint 2010 workflow (that can be called from a SharePoint 2013 workflow).
