# SharePoint 2013 workflows aren't available for IRM policies in SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server on-premises

## Problem

In SharePoint Server 2013 on-premises or SharePoint Online, you create a Microsoft SharePoint 2013 workflow by using the SharePoint 2013 Workflow Platform content type on a list or a library. However, the workflow isn't visible in Information Rights Management (IRM) Retention Policy.

## Solution

To work around this issue, use the SharePoint 2010 Workflow Platform content type when you create the workflow.

## More information

SharePoint 2010 workflow associations are the only workflow that the IRM Retention Policy surfaces. The **SPWorkflowAssociation** class is the only class that's enumerated on the list or content type level that the workflow drop-down menu displays.
