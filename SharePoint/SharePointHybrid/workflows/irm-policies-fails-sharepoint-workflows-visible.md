# SharePoint 2013 workflows aren't available for IRM policies in SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server on-premises

## Problem

You create a Microsoft SharePoint 2013 workflow by using the SharePoint 2013 Workflow Platform content type on a list or a library in SharePoint Server 2013 on-premises or SharePoint Online. However, the workflow isn't visible in Information Rights Management (IRM) Retention Policy.

## Solution

To work around this issue, use the SharePoint 2010 Workflow Platform content type when you create the workflow.

## More information

SharePoint 2010 workflow associations are the only kind of workflow that's surfaced by the IRM Retention Policy. The **SPWorkflowAssociation** class is the only class that's enumerated on the list or content type level that's displayed on the workflow drop-down menu.
