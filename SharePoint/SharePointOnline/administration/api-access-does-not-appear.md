# (Advanced) and (API access) do not appear in the SharePoint Online Modern admin center

## Symptoms

The **Advanced** and **API Access** options do not appear in the navigation pane of the SharePoint Online Modern admin center.

## Cause

These options may not available if an app catalog site is not created or is incorrectly registered on the tenant.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:
1.	Go to the admin center, and select **More features**.
2.	Under **Apps**, select **Open**.

3.	Select **App Catalog**, and then select **Create a new app catalog site**. Enter the necessary information, including title, URL, and administrator, as appropriate.

    > [!note]
    > If you have already created an app catalog site, proceed to step 7. 
4.	Copy the URL of the app catalog site, and save it to a separate location (such as Notepad, a Word doc, or another program). 
5.	Wait for the site to finish provisioning.
Note: This process may take up to 10 minutes.
6.	After the site is provisioned, return to the Apps page, and then select **App Catalog**.
7.	Select **Enter a URL for an existing app catalog site**, and paste the URL of the app catalog site that you just created.

    > [!note]
    > The site may take up to 20 minutes to complete the registration process.

After the site is registered as an app catalog, return to the SharePoint Modern admin center. You will now see both the **Advanced** and  **API access** options.
