# Authentication errors occur when client doesn't have TLS 1.2 support

## Summary

As previously communicated in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (for example, communication MC240160 in February 2021), we're moving all online services to Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2+. This change started on October 15, 2020. Support for TLS 1.2+ will continue to be added to all Microsoft 365 environments for the next several months. If you haven't taken steps to prepare for this change, your connectivity to Microsoft 365 might be affected.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Even after upgrading to TLS 1.2, it's important to make sure that cipher suites match Azure Front Door (AFD) support, because Microsoft 365 and AFD have a slight difference in cipher suite support. 
>
> For TLS1.2 the following cipher suites are supported by AFD:
> 
> - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
> - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
> - TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
> - TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
> 
> To add cipher suites, either deploy a group policy via [Configuring TLS Cipher Suite Order by using Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-server/security/tls/manage-tls#configuring-tls-cipher-suite-order-by-using-group-policy)
> 
> To use PowerShell, see [Enable-TlsCipherSuite](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/tls/enable-tlsciphersuite?view=windowsserver2019-ps).
>
> For more information, see [What are the current cipher suites supported by Azure Front Door?](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-faq#what-are-the-current-cipher-suites-supported-by-azure-front-door-).

## .NET Framework not configured for TLS 1.2

   ### Symptom

   You experience one or more of the following errors when you access SharePoint:

   >System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a send.

   >System.IO.IOException: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.

   >System.Net.Sockets.SocketException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.

   ### Resolution
   
   For more information about how to configure .NET Framework to enable TLS 1.2+, see [Configure for strong cryptography](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2-client#configure-for-strong-cryptography).

## OS doesn't have TLS 1.2 enabled

   ### Symptom
   
   Authentication issues occur in older operating systems and browsers that don’t have TLS 1.2 enabled, or in specific network configurations and proxy settings that force legacy TLS protocols.

   ### Resolution
   
   For more information, see [Preparing for TLS 1.2 in Office 365 and Office 365 GCC](/microsoft-365/compliance/prepare-tls-1.2-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).<br/>

## Network drive mapped to a SharePoint library

   ### Symptom
   
   Authentication issues or failures occur when you try to use a network drive that's mapped to a SharePoint library.

   ### Resolution
   
   The issue might occur because of the operating system in use and whether the web client supports TLS 1.2. Web Client. Support for TLS 1.2 is as follows:

   Windows 8 and Windows 7 will support TLS 1.2 after you install [KB 3140245](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-winhttp-in-windows-c4bd73d2-31d7-761e-0178-11268bb10392) and create a corresponding registry value. For more information, see [Update to enable TLS 1.2 as default secure protocols in WinHTTP in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-winhttp-in-windows-c4bd73d2-31d7-761e-0178-11268bb10392).

   Windows 8.1 will support TLS 1.2 after an update that's scheduled for the third quarter of 2021.

   Windows 10 already supports TLS 1.2.

## Browser doesn't support TLS 1.2

   ### Symptom
   
   Authentication issues or failures to access SharePoint from known apps that don't support TLS 1.2+ occur. The following browsers don’t support TLS 1.2:
- Android 4.3 and earlier versions
- Firefox version 5.0 and earlier versions
- Internet Explorer 8-10 on Windows 7 and earlier
- Internet Explorer 10 on Windows Phone 8
- Safari 6.0.4/OS X10.8.4 and earlier versions


### Resolution
   
   Upgrade to a later version of the browser.
   
## Windows Server 2012 R2 missing necessary cipher suites

   ### Symptom
   
   Authentication issues with Windows Server 2012 R2 due to missing two cipher suites that are needed for Azure Front Door.
   
   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

   ### Resolution
   
   Configuration to add the missing cipher suites must be completed on Windows 2012 R2. If Windows 2012 R2 is still experiencing the issue, ensure there are no Windows Group Policy (GOP) exceptions that would prevent the cipher suites on Windows 2012 R2 servers.<br/>
