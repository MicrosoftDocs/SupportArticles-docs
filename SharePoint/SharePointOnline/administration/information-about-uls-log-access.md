# Information about ULS log access for SharePoint Online

## Introduction

This article contains information about Unified Logging System (ULS) log access in SharePoint Online.

## More information

Microsoft uses the Unified Logging System (ULS) in the SharePoint Online environment. Sometimes we receive requests to share these ULS logs with customers for troubleshooting and debugging scenarios. Microsoft does not provide copies of ULS logs or any access to ULS logs from SharePoint Online.
