# "Your organization's policies do not allow you to share with these users" error when sharing an item or site in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business 

## Symptom

When trying to share an item or a site in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business, you see the error "Your organization's policies do not allow you to share with these users".

## Cause

This error message generally means that external sharing is turned off for your SharePoint or OneDrive sites. 

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

### Check the external sharing setting for your organization

1.    Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions for your organization.)

> [!NOTE]
> -    If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. 
> - If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.

2.    In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)
> [!NOTE]
> If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

3.    In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, under **Policies**, select **Sharing**.
4.    Under **External sharing**, specify your sharing level for SharePoint and OneDrive. 

### Check the external sharing settings for the site that you want to share from

#### If you're sharing from a SharePoint site:

1.    In the SharePoint admin center, select **Try it now** to open the new SharePoint admin center.
2.    In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, select **Active sites**.
3.    Select the site that you want to share from, and then under **External sharing** select **Change**.
4.    Make sure that either **New and existing guests** or **Anyone** is selected, and then select **Save** if you made changes.

Try sharing again.

#### If you're sharing from OneDrive:

1.    In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **OneDrive**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)
2.    Under **External sharing**, select either **New and existing external users** or **Anyone** for **OneDrive**.
3.    Select **Save**.

Try sharing again.
