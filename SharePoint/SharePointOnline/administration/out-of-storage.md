# SharePoint Online out of storage space

<!-- This article has been reviewed and approved for the specific use of global admin perms.  -->

As a Global admin, you might get an email with one of the following messages:

> SharePoint Online is out of storage space.
> There is not enough storage space on SharePoint Online.

The amount of Microsoft SharePoint storage for your organization is based on the number of licenses you have.

Your organization has a total storage of 1 TB plus 10 GB per license of eligible plan purchased, plus any Microsoft 365 Extra File Storage add-on purchased.

If you suspect you should have more storage than is displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 admins can run the following diagnostic tool. It will identify any issues with your SharePoint Online tenant storage quota, and show how the quota is allocated.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires a Microsoft 365 administrator account. This diagnostic isn't available for the GCC High or DoD environments, or for Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet.

To troubleshoot any issues with your storage limits, see [Manage site storage limits](/sharepoint/manage-site-collection-storage-limits).
