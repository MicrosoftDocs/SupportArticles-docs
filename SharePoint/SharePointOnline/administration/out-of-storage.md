# SharePoint Online out of storage space

As a global admin, you might get an email with one of the following messages:

> SharePoint Online is out of storage space

> There is not enough storage space on SharePoint Online

> Your storage is almost full

The amount of Microsoft SharePoint storage for your organization is based on your number of licenses.

Your organization has total storage of 1 TB plus 10 GB per license of eligible plan purchased, plus any Microsoft 365 Extra File Storage add-on purchased.

If you suspect you should have more storage than is displayed in the Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft 365 admins can run the following diagnostic tool. It will identify any issues with your SharePoint Online tenant storage quota, and show how the quota is allocated.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature requires a Microsoft 365 administrator account. This feature isn't available for Microsoft 365 Government, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.
