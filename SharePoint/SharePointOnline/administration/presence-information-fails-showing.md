# Presence information does not show on a SharePoint page

Assume that you have Skype for Business running on the computer. When you open a SharePoint page, your presence information is not shown.

## Workarounds

Use one of the following two workarounds, and then open the page again:

- Disable Protected Mode for Internet Explorer by clearing the **Enable Protected Mode** check box on the **Security** tab in the **Internet Options** dialog box.
- Run Internet Explorer as an administrator.

## Why this issue occurs

The Office add-on for Internet Explorer loops though all the processes on the computer to look for the Skype for Business process so that it can use a handle to the process to communicate with it.  When Internet Explorer runs in Protected Mode, Windows security restricts the process list that is sent back to the Office add-on, and the Skype for Business handle is inaccessible.
