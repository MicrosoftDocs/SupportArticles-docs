# Profile picture isn't shown in SharePoint Online

Your SharePoint Online profile picture isn't displayed on SharePoint sites or in People web parts. To get your profile picture displayed, try the following resolution.

## Run the Picture Sync diagnostic

> This feature requires a Microsoft 365 administrator account. This diagnostic isn't available for the GCC High or DoD environments, or for Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet.

Microsoft 365 admin users have access to diagnostics that can be run within the tenant to verify possible issues with user photos.

Select **Run Tests** to populate the diagnostic in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
