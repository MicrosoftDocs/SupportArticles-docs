# Sharing options are greyed out when sharing from SharePoint Online or OneDrive

## Symptoms
Sharing options are grayed out when attempting to share from SharePoint Online or OneDrive.

## Cause
This issue can occur if you do not have sharing settings enabled properly for the site or organization. 

For example:
1.	Select the file or folder you want to share, and then select **Share**.
2.	Select the dropdown list to change the type of link. In the **Link settings** screen, you can change who is able to access the link and edit the item youâ€™re sharing.
3.	If one of the sharing options is grayed out, your organization's administrators may have restricted it.<br/>

## Resolution
To resolve this issue, follow the steps below to ensure the proper sharing settings are enabled for your organization and site collection. 

### Check the external sharing settings for your organization
1.	Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> - If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. 
> - If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.

2.	In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)<br/>

> [!NOTE]
> If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

3.	In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, under **Policies**, select **Sharing**.
4.	Under **External sharing**, specify your sharing level for SharePoint and OneDrive. 

### Check the external sharing settings for the site that you want to share from
**If you're sharing from a SharePoint site:**
1.	In the SharePoint admin center, click **Try it now** to open the new SharePoint admin center.
2.	In the left pane of the new SharePoint admin center, select **Active sites**.
3.	Select the site that you want to share from, and then under **External sharing** click **Change**.
4.	Make sure that either **New and existing guests** or **Anyone** is selected, and then select **Save** if you made changes.

Try sharing again.

**If you're sharing from OneDrive:**
1.	In the Microsoft 365 admin center, in the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **OneDrive**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.)
2.	Under **External sharing**, select either **New and existing external users** or **Anyone** for **OneDrive**.
3.	Select **Save**.

Try sharing again.
