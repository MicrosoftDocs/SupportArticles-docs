# Creating a team site from SharePoint Home doesn’t finish

## Symptoms

When you try to [create a team site](/sharepoint/create-site-collection) from SharePoint Home, the site creation process stops or never finishes. This might occur if the Limited-access user permission lockdown mode for the SharePoint [root site](/sharepoint/modern-root-site) is activated.

## Cause

Group-Connected Team sites require the ability to mae REST requests to SharePoint. SharePoint uses the UseRemoteAPI [permission level](/sharepoint/understanding-permission-levels#site-permissions-and-permission-levels).

## Resolution

Ask your organization’s SharePoint administrator to create the site for you.

If you are a SharePoint administrator, and you don’t need the Limited-access user permission lockdown mode on your SharePoint root site, you can turn off the mode by following these steps:

1. Select the Settings (gear) icon.

1. Open **Site Settings** > **Site Collection Administrator** > **Site Collection Features**.

1. Select **Limited-access user permission lockdown mode**, and then select **Deactivate**.
