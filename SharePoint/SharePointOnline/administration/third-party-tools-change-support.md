# Support for changes made by third-party tools in SharePoint Online

## Summary

Microsoft does not directly support problems that are caused by using third-party tools in Microsoft SharePoint Online. A third-party tool can be any automatic method that's intended to import, update, or export any type of data, user accounts, metadata, or content.

When you use third-party tools, primary support for problems that are related to the creation, management, or operation of any SharePoint feature is the sole responsibility of the third-party tool vendor.

If you have problems in SharePoint Online that are caused by using third-party tools, you must contact the third-party tool vendor directly for support before Microsoft can provide any additional support.

## More information

After a thorough analysis, if the third-party tool vendor believes that the problem is caused by SharePoint, they can contact Microsoft Support on your behalf to provide a summary of their findings and an explanation of why they believe that the responsibility for resolving your problem belongs to Microsoft.

Microsoft Support will do a full investigation of the problem after we are contacted by the third-party vendor. If the problem is determined to be related to using the third-party tool, Microsoft will advise the tool vendor of their responsibility to resolve the problem. If the problem is determined to be unrelated to the use of the third-party tool, Microsoft will work directly with you to resolve the problem.
