# Unable to delete items in SharePoint and OneDrive

## Summary

You may find that you are unable to delete files in SharePoint or OneDrive. This article describes ways to narrow down the issue and find a solution. 

## More information

There are several reasons why you may be unable to delete a file. Try each of these until you find one that resolves your issue.

- Ensure the item is not [checked out](https://support.office.com/article/check-out-check-in-or-discard-changes-to-files-in-a-library-7e2c12a9-a874-4393-9511-1378a700f6de) to another user. 
- Always make sure you have the [appropriate permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/default-sharepoint-groups) to delete the item or have a [site collection administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/customize-sharepoint-site-permissions#add-change-or-remove-a-site-collection-administrator) attempt remove the item.
- Retention policies can cause this. You might have to either disable or exclude the respective hold policy that's causing the issue. After a retention policy or hold is removed, it may take up to 24 hours for the change to take effect. Ensure that there is not a [retention policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/securitycompliance/retention-policies) set up on the item.
- The site might have exceeded its storage limit. [Increase the site quota](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/set-sposite?view=sharepoint-ps) and delete the item.
- Administrators can use [SharePoint Patterns and Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps#installation) (PnP), which contains a library of PowerShell commands that allows you to perform complex management actions such as force the deletion of items you cannot otherwise delete. <br/>
