# "A different version of this App is already installed with the same version number" error when you try to update a SharePoint app

## Problem

When you try to update a Microsoft SharePoint app that you're developing by using Microsoft Visual Studio, you receive the following error message:

**A different version of this App is already installed with the same version number.**

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use a later version number in the App element of the Appmanifest.xml file.

For more information, see [Update SharePoint Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/update-sharepoint-add-ins).

## More information

This error can occur if you don't manually update the app version number in the app manifest file (Appmanifest.xml).
