# "Couldn't connect to the catalog server for this app" error when you click a guest link to a SharePoint Online item

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You publish an app to a Microsoft SharePoint app catalog.
- An item (such as an Excel worksheet) that uses the app is shared to guest users by its URL.
- When you configured sharing, you cleared the **Require sign-in** check box.
- The recipient of the shared item clicks the guest link to open the shared resource.

In this scenario, the user receives the following error message:

**App Error We couldn't connect to the catalog server for this app.**

## Solution

To work around this issue, publish your app to the Office Store. Or, provide an account in the organization through which the user can access the content.

## More information

This error occurs because the guest user has access to the content that uses the app, but doesn't have access to the app catalog.
