# MSN Weather Service API has been retired

## Information

Microsoft discontinued access to the MSN Weather Service API on April 15, 2016. Because of this change, the MSN Weather Service request URL is now disabled. For example, the following URL no longer returns results:

```asciidoc
http://weather.service.msn.com/data.aspx?weadegreetype=F&culture=en-US&weasearchstr=Redmond,WA 
```

There are third-party alternative providers that offer API-based weather information.
