# "This content cannot be displayed in a frame" when you view Outlook Web App in a Page Viewer Web Part

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You add a Page Viewer Web Part to your Microsoft SharePoint Online page.

- Within the properties for the Web Part, you configured the **Link** setting to point to the Microsoft Office 365 Outlook Web App.

In this scenario, when you view the Web Part on a SharePoint Online page, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
This content cannot be displayed in a frame

To help protect the security of information you enter into this website, the publisher of this content does not allow it to be displayed in a frame.
```

## Solution

This issue occurs because the Outlook Web App can't be opened in a frame.
