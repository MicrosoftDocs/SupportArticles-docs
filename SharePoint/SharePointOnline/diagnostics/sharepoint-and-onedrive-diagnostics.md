# How to troubleshoot issues in SharePoint Online and OneDrive using diagnostics

## Summary

It’s important that administrators can diagnose and resolve issues quickly in SharePoint Online and OneDrive. To support this effort, the SharePoint support team has released new features in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is not available for Microsoft 365 Government, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany.

## More information

Diagnostic capabilities for a few text queries were first released within the Microsoft 365 admin center support portal in December 2018.
