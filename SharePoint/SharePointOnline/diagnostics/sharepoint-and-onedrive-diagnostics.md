# Self-help diagnostics for SharePoint Online and OneDrive administrators

## Summary

It's important that administrators can diagnose and resolve issues quickly in SharePoint Online and OneDrive. To support this effort, the SharePoint support team has released features in the Microsoft 365 admin center to resolve common issues. 

> [!NOTE]
> These diagnostics are not currently supported for GCC High, DoD, or Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet.

## More information

Diagnostic capabilities for a few text queries were first released within the Microsoft 365 admin center support portal in December 2018.

When IT admins run customer diagnostics in the Microsoft 365 admin center to resolve issues without logging support requests, Microsoft will make donations to global nonprofit organizations.
