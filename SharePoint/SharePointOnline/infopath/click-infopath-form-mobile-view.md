# "Sorry, something went wrong" when you click an InfoPath form in mobile view in SharePoint Online

## Problem

On a mobile device, you browse to a forms library that contains a published InfoPath form. When you click the form, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Sorry, something went wrong.

An unexpected error has occurred.
```

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, use full-screen view (also known as PC view) on your mobile device, and then click the InfoPath form to open it.

For more information about full-screen view, see [Use a mobile device to work with SharePoint Online sites](https://support.office.com/article/a99f2acf-381a-442c-b305-3e74c251bcb6).

> [!NOTE]
> In this scenario, you may have to browse to another list or library to find the option to switch to full-screen view.
