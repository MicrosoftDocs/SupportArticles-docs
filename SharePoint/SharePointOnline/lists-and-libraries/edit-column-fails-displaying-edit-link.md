# "Edit (link to edit item)" column in a SharePoint Online list doesn't display the edit link

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You're using the new look and navigation experience for document libraries in SharePoint Online.
- You add the **Edit (link to edit item) column** to the view.

However, when you view the library by using the new look and navigation experience, no link is present for items in the library.

## Solution

To Edit Properties of the file/item you can 

click the ellipsis (...) for an item in the list, select **more**, and then click **Properties** to edit the item.
or
Select the item in the select and click on Information Panel(i)
