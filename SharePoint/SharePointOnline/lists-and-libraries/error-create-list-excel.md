## Cause

The default **Document Library** is deleted, or its name is renamed from **Documents** to something else.  

## Resolution

- If the default **Document Library** is deleted and present in the recycle bin, restore it.

- If the default **Document Library** is deleted and not present in the recycle bin, create a **new library** with the name **Documents**.

- If the default Document Library name is renamed from **Documents** to something else, rename it back to **Documents** from **Library Settings -> List name, Description and Navigation -> Name**.
