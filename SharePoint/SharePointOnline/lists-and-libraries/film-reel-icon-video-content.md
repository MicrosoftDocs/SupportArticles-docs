# SharePoint Online Asset Library displays a film reel icon for the Video content type in Office 365

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- In SharePoint Online, you create an Asset Library.

- You create a folder in the Asset Library.

- You change the properties of the folder and then change the Content Type setting from Folder to Video.

- You change the properties and then change the Content Type setting back to Folder from Video.

When you view the thumbnail image for the folder, it still displays the film reel icon for a video.

## Solution

This is a known issue in SharePoint Online. Although the film reel icon appears, the Content Type will function as a folder.
