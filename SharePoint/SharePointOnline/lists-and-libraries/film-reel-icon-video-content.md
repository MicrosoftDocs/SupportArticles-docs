# SharePoint Online Asset Library displays a film reel icon for the Video content type in Microsoft 365

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- In SharePoint Online, you create an Asset Library.

- You create a folder in the Asset Library.

- You change the properties of the folder and then change the Content Type setting from Folder to Video.
  In classic UI, the thumbnail image will have film reel icon 
  In Modern UI, the thumbnail image will have folder icon still

- You change the properties and then change the Content Type setting back to Folder from Video.
  In classic UI, the thumbnail image will have film reel icon still
  In Modern UI, the thumbnail image will have folder icon 

## Solution

This is a known issue in SharePoint Online.
Although the film reel icon appears in classic UI, the Content Type will function as a folder.
