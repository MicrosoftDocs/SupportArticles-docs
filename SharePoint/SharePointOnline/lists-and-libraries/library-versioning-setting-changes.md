# Changes to the default versioning setting for SharePoint Online document libraries

## Introduction

This article describes previous changes to the default versioning setting for SharePoint Online document libraries.

## More information

Changes were made previously to SharePoint Online that enable the **Create major versions** setting for all document libraries on current sites. By default, this configuration is also enabled for document libraries on all newly created sites. Document versioning lets you recover earlier versions of your files so that you can revert to an earlier version if you want to.

For most users, there should be no additional action required. In the unlikely event that your storage quota runs low, users and administrators can resolve these issues by performing one of the following actions:

- Delete earlier versions that are no longer needed from the **Version History list**.
- Add to the storage quota for the affected site. For more information, see [Manage site collection storage limits](/sharepoint/manage-site-collection-storage-limits).

For more information about versioning configuration in SharePoint Online, see [How does versioning work in a list or library](https://support.office.com/article/how-does-versioning-work-in-a-sharepoint-list-or-library-0f6cd105-974f-44a4-aadb-43ac5bdfd247)
