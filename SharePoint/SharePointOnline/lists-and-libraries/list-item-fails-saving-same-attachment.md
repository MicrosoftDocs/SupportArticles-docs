# Error when you delete a SharePoint Online list item attachment and then attach a file with the same name

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You're using the classic view for a Microsoft SharePoint Online list.
- You edit a list item that has an attachment, and you select the option to **Delete** the attachment.
- You reattach the same file or a file that has the same file name.

When you click **Save** in this scenario, you receive the following error message:

**Sorry, something went wrong.**

**A file with the name already exists.**

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:

- After you delete the attachment for the list item, click **Save**. Edit the list item again, reattach the file, and then click **Save**.
- Upload the attachment with a different file name before you click **Save**.
