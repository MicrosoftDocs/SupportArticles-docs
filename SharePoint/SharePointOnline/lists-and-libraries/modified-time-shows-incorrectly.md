# Modified time is not displayed correctly for a SharePoint Online list item

## Problem

When you view the **Modified** column in a SharePoint Online list, the list item shows the time stamp as "12:00 AM," even though no change was made at that specific time. The following conditions are also true in this situation:

- Under **Site Settings, Regional Settings, Locale**, your locale is set as **English (South Africa)**.
- Under **Site Settings, Regional Settings, Time Format**, the time format is set as **12 Hour**.

## Solution

To work around this issue, set the time format to **24 Hour**. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Browse to the site where the issue exists.
1. Click the gear icon to open the **Settings** menu, and then click **Site settings**.
1. In the **Site Administration** section of the Site Settings page, click **Regional settings**.
1. Change the **Time Format** setting to **24 Hour**, and then click **OK**.

> [!NOTE]
> After you make this configuration change, the time stamp will reflect an accurate time. However, it'll be displayed in 24-hour format.
