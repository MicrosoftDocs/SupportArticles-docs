1. Return to the Office 365 portal, and then create a document.

### Method 2: Create a "Documents" list on your Team Site

1. Browse to your Team Site at http://*YourDomain*.sharepoint.com/teamsite, where *YourDomain* is the domain for your organization.
1. In Quick Launch on the left side of the page, click **All Site Content**.
