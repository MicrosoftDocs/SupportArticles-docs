# SharePoint Online Picture Library doesn't display thumbnail previews

## Problem

You have a picture library that's using the classic experience for lists and libraries in SharePoint Online. You add a large image to the Picture Library. However, when you use the **Thumbnails** view for the library, the thumbnail image isn't displayed. Additionally, when you click the image, the Preview field displays a broken image-link icon and the text "Picture."

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, reduce the image to less than 50 megapixels, or use the new SharePoint Online Document Library view.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the thumbnail preview for the image is affected by this issue, you can open the file as expected by clicking the file name.

## More information

This issue occurs when the size of an image exceeds 50 megapixels in a picture library that uses the classic view.
