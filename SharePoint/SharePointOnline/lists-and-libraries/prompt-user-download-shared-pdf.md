# A link to a shared PDF file from SharePoint Online in Office 365 or OneDrive for Business prompts the user to download the file

## Problem

Consider the following scenario.

- You browse to a SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business site, and then you click SHARE for a PDF file.
- You click Get a link, and then click CREATE LINK for either the View Only or Edit options.
- You share the link with a user.
In this scenario, when the user browses to the shared PDF, they're prompted to download the file and they can't view it in the browser.

## Solution

This is expected behavior in SharePoint Online. Users must download the PDF file in order to view it.
