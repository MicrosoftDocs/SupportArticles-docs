## Problem

When you browse to a SharePoint Online document library in classic Experience, the following simple controls are missing and aren't available for the list:

- Upload
- Sync
- Edit
- Manage
- Share

## Solution

To work around this problem, use the **Default** style within the view for the affected library.
or
Switch to Modern Experience 

## More information

This problem occurs when you use a view for the document library if the view style is configured to any setting other than **Default**.
