# The simple controls are missing for a SharePoint Online document library

## Problem

When you browse to a SharePoint Online document library, the following simple controls are missing and aren't available for the list:

- New

- Upload

- Sync

- Edit

- Manage

- Share

## Solution

To work around this problem, use the **Default** style within the view for the affected library.

## More information

This problem occurs when you use a view for the document library if the view style is configured to any setting other than **Default**.
