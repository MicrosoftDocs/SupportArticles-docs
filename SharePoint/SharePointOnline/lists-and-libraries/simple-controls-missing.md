## Problem

When you browse to a SharePoint Online document library in classic Experience, the following simple controls are missing and aren't available for the list:

- Edit

- Manage

## Solution

To work around this problem, use the **Default** style within the view for the affected library.

Switch to Modern Experience 

## More information
