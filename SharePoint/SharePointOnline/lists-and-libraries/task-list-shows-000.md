# Task list shows item title as `.000`

## Symptom

When you view a Task list in SharePoint, the title of an item appears as:

> `.000`

## Cause

You're viewing the list in the new experience. Currently, the new experience doesn't support task lists.

For more information about content types, see [Create and edit content types](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-edit-content-types-3d5d45af-608d-4183-8d51-073095fe0312).

## Resolution

Task lists are supported in the classic experience. Switch the list to Classic experience by following the instructions found on [Switch the default experience for lists and libraries from new or classic](https://support.microsoft.com/office/switch-the-default-experience-for-lists-and-libraries-from-new-or-classic-66dac24b-4177-4775-bf50-3d267318caa9).
