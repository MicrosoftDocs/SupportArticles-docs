# Search results missing in SharePoint Online

## Problem

When a user tries to search a site in SharePoint Online, items may be missing from the search results. For example, the following items may be missing:

- Content
- Pages
- ASPX pages

This issue may occur even though the site was crawled and indexed by the Search service, and the user has permissions to access the resource by using a search query.

## Cause

There are various reasons why expected results may be missing that are related to crawl latency or settings in SharePoint Online.

## Solution

1. Make sure that **Allow this site to appear in Search results** is set to **Yes**.
        
     1. As an admin, locate the site that's missing results.
    
     1. Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner.
    
     1. Select **Site Settings**.
    
     1. Under **Search**, select **Search and offline availability**.
    
     1. Make sure that **Allow this site to appear in Search results** is set to **Yes**. 
    
         After the setting is set to **Yes**, the site should be indexed during the next scheduled crawl.
    
         > [!NOTE]
         > From the same location, admins can also select **Reindex Site** to enable the site to be picked up during the next scheduled search crawl.
    
         See the [More Information](#more-information) section for a detailed explanation and walk-through of site-level search configuration settings.

1. Make sure that **Allow items from this document library to appear in search results?** is set to **Yes**.

    1. As an admin, locate the library that's missing from search results.
    
    1. Click the gear icon in the upper-right corner.
    
    1. Select **Library Settings**.
    
    1. Select **Advanced Settings**.
    
    1. Make sure that **Allow items from this document library to appear in search results?** is set to **Yes**.
    
         After the setting is set to **Yes**, the library should be indexed during the next scheduled crawl.
    
         > [!NOTE]
         > From the same location, admins can also select **Reindex Document Library** to make sure that all content in the document library is indexed during the next scheduled crawl.

1. Verify draft items are crawled, see [Draft items are not crawled in SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/9198c307-13d6-425c-a174-542a60e410e4).

1. Verify the site's search visibility options at the following location: 

     **<site_name>/_layouts/srchvis.aspx**

     Make sure that the **Allow this site to appear in Search results** option is selected.

### Parent site and sub site-specific search issues

The default setting for search visibility is one of the following options:

- **Do not index Web Parts if this site contains fine-grained permissions**
- **Always index all Web Parts on this site**
- **Never index any Web Parts on this site**

If a subsite on the site collection doesn't inherit permissions, .aspx pages won't appear in the search results. To resolve this issue, set the search visibility option in Srchvis.aspx to **Always index all Web Parts on this site**. Additionally, you may set the subsite to inherit permissions from the parent site.
