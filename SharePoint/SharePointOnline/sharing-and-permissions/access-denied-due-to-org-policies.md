- If you're receiving an error message that states "Due to organizational policies, you can't access this resource from this **untrusted device**" it may be due to an [Unmanaged Device Policy](/sharepoint/control-access-from-unmanaged-devices).
- If you're receiving an error message that states "Due to organizational policies, you can't access this resource from this **network location**.", continue with the

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, try the following method, depending on your level of permissions.

### Non-administrators

If you receive this error message, contact your [Microsoft 365 Administrator](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). 

### Administrators

> [!NOTE]
> This diagnostic isn't currently supported for GCC High, DoD, Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet, or Microsoft 365 Germany customers.

If you are an administrator, and you have locked yourself out of SharePoint and OneDrive because of a location-based policy, follow these steps to unlock the tenant:

1. Select **Run Tests**, which will populate the diagnostic in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. 

    > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
    > [Run Tests: Access Denied due to Network Location](https://aka.ms/AccessDeniedDuetoNetworkLocation)

2. In the diagnostic form, select the SharePoint Online root URL and then select **Run Tests**.

3. If the test detects that you have a network-based location policy set and you are currently locked out of your tenant, you can choose to disable the policy.
