# Anonymous users are prompted for credentials in a library  

## Symptoms  

When anonymous users try to access an asset in a Microsoft SharePoint Online style library, they receive an authentication prompt.

The following list includes the affected file name extensions that trigger the prompt:

```  
.gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe, .jfif, .bmp, .dib, .tif, .tiff, .themedbmp, .themedcss, .themedgif, .themedjpg, .themedpng, .ico, .png, .wdp, .hdp, .css, .js, .asf, .avi, .flv, .m4v, .mov, .mp3, .mp4, .mpeg, .mpg, .rm, .rmvb, .wma, .wmv, .ogg, .ogv, .oga, .webm, .xap
```

## Cause  

Microsoft has changed the behavior of the "Everyone" claim. This claim no longer includes anonymous users in SharePoint Online.   

## Resolution  

If you use SharePoint Online to host assets in a custom solution, and people try to access those assets as anonymous users, we recommend that you use external Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to host the assets.
