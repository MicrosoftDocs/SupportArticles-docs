# "EMAIL EVERYONE" link is hidden when you share in SharePoint Online

## Problem

You click **Option** and then open the **Share** window to share a resource for a SharePoint Online site, folder or file. When you view the **Shared with** tab, you notice that the **EMAIL EVERYONE** option is missing.

## Solution

The **EMAIL EVERYONE** option is available only when the number of users that the SharePoint Online site, folder, or file is shared with is less than 30. If the site, folder, or file is already shared with more than 30 users, you cannot use the **EMAIL EVERYONE** functionality.

## More information

This is expected behavior in SharePoint Online.
