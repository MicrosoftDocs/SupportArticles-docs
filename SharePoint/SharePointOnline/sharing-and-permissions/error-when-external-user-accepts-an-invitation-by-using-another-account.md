# Error when a guest user accepts a SharePoint Online invitation by using another account

## Symptoms

You receive one of the following error messages when trying to access a shared resource by using a guest account:

- `Access Denied`
- `Let us know why you need access to this site.`
- `User is not found in the directory`
- `You need permission to access this site.`

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Determine which account accepted the invitation.
1. Remove the incorrect account and add the correct account.
1. Reinvite the user to the resource.

> **Note**:
> Many examples in this article use \<contoso\> as a placeholder. In your scenario, replace \<contoso\> with the domain that you use for your organization.

### Determine which account has access as a guest user

If you can access the site as the incorrect external user, follow these steps:

1. Sign in as the external user account that you used to accept the invite.

2. Click the profile image in the upper-right corner, and then click **My Settings**.

3. In the **Account** field, review the email address. For example, `i:0#.f|membership|JonDoe@contoso.com`.

   > **Note**:
   > In this example, JonDoe@contoso.com is the email account that accepted the user invitation.

4. If the address is incorrect, follow the steps in the "Remove the incorrect external user account" section of this article.

If you can't access the site as the incorrect external user, follow these steps:

1. As a SharePoint Online administrator, sign in to the site collection that was shared with the external user.

2. Select the gear icon for the **Settings** menu, and then select **Site settings**.

3. In the **Users and Permissions** section, select **People and groups**.

4. At the end of the URL in your browser window, after the **people.aspx?** part of the URL, replace **MembershipGroupId=\<number>** with **MembershipGroupId=0**, and then press Enter.

5. In the list of users, locate the name of the external user. Right-click the user name, and copy the shortcut.

6. In a new browser window or tab, paste the URL that you copied in the previous step into the address box. Add **&force=1** to the end of the URL, and then press Enter.

7. In the **Account** field, review the email address. For example, `*i:0#.f|membership|JonDoe\@contoso.com`.

   > **Note**:
   > In this example, JonDoe\@contoso.com is the email account that accepted the user invitation.

8. If the address is incorrect, follow the steps in the "Remove the incorrect external user account" section of this article.

### Remove the incorrect external user account

You need to remove the external user account from each site collection to which the account has access. To remove the user account, you can use either the SharePoint Online user interface or SharePoint Online Management Shell depending on your version of Microsoft 365.

For Microsoft 365 for Business subscriptions, use the SharePoint Online UI:

1. Browse to the Microsoft 365 admin center at https://portal.office.com.

2. In **service settings**, select **Manage Organization-wide settings**.

3. Select **sites and document sharing** from the left navigation menu, and then select **Remove individual external users**.

4. Select the external user to be removed, and then select the **Delete** icon.

For all other subscriptions, use SharePoint Online Management Shell by using the following steps:

> [!NOTE]
> This option doesn't apply to Office Small Business (P) organizations.

1. Download and install [SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://support.office.com/article/introduction-to-the-sharepoint-online-management-shell-c16941c3-19b4-4710-8056-34c034493429?ocmsassetID=HA102915057&CorrelationId=6f224f8f-1905-463f-8999-9dc7feec8d8a&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).

2. Start SharePoint Online Management Shell and run the following command:

   ```powershell
   $cred = Get-Credential
   ```

4. In the **Windows PowerShell Credential required** dialog box, enter your administrator credentials, and then select **OK**.

5. Connect to SharePoint Online, and then run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-SPOService -Url https://-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $cred
   ```

6. Remove the user from each site collection. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   $ExtUser = Get-SPOExternalUser -filter <account@contoso.com>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > In this command, replace <account@contoso.com> with the affected account. 

   To remove the user, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs @($ExtUser.UniqueId)
   ```

Use the following steps to remove the external user's ability to access SharePoint Online. However, the user might still appear in search results and within the SharePoint Online Management Shell `Get-SPOUser` cmdlet. 
To remove the user from SharePoint Online completely, remove the user from the UserInfo list by using one of the following methods. 

1. Use the SharePoint Online UI. Browse to each site collection that the user previously had access to, and then follow these steps:

   1. At the site collection, edit the URL by adding the following string to the end of the URL:

      ```powershell
      _layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0
      ```

      For example, the full URL resembles the following example:

      ```powershell
      https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0
      ```

   2. Select the user from the list.

   3. Click **Remove User Permissions** from the ribbon.

2. Use the SharePoint Online Management Shell. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This option doesn't apply to Small Business subscriptions.

   1. Start SharePoint Online Management Shell.

   2. Run the following command:
 
      ```powershell
      $cred = Get-Credential
      ```

      In the Windows PowerShell Credential required window, type your administrator credentials, then select **OK**.

   3. Connect to SharePoint Online, and then run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Connect-SPOService -Url https://<contoso>-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $cred
      ```

   4. Remove the user from each site collection.

      Run the following command to identify the affected guest user account:
  
      ```powershell
      Get-SPOUser -Site https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com | FT â€“a
      ```

    Notice the guest user's Login Name in the returned results. For a guest user, it might have a "live.com#" prefix if it's a Microsoft account.

    Run the following command to remove the external user account:

     ```powershell
     Remove-SPOUser -Site https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com -LoginName live.com#jondoe@company.com
     ```

   > **Note**:
   > Replace live.com#jondoe@company.com with the user's login name in your scenario.

Next, you have to remove the account from Microsoft Entra ID:

 1. Download and install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK by running the following command:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery 
    ```

1. Open PowerShell and connect to Microsoft Graph by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All","Directory.ReadWrite.All"
   ```

1. Enter your administrator credentials in the dialog box.
   
1. Locate the external (guest) user by running the following command. This command filters for the guest account by UPN and displays the ID, UPN, and UserType of the account. 
   Replace `jondoe_contoso.com#EXT#@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com` with the specific user in your scenario.

   ```powershell
   $guestUpn = 'jondoe_contoso.com#EXT#@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com'
   Get-MgUser -Filter "UserPrincipalName eq '$guestUpn'" -Property Id,UserPrincipalName,UserType | Format-Table -AutoSize
   ```
   
1. Remove (soft-delete) the guest user by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-MgUser -UserId <user-id> -Confirm:$false
   ```
   
1. (Optional) Delete the guest user from the recycle bin permanently by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   $deleted = Get-MgDirectoryDeletedItem -Filter "Id eq '<user-id>'" -All
   Remove-MgDirectoryDeletedItem -DirectoryObjectId $deleted.Id -Confirm:$false
   ```
      
### Clear the browser cache

SharePoint Online uses browser caching in several scenarios, including the People Picker feature. Even after a user is fully removed from the system, the user might still remain in the browser cache. Clearing the browser cache resolves this issue. When you clear the cache, make sure that you also select the **Cookies and website data** option.

### Reinvite the external user

After you delete the external user account, reinvite the external user to the site by using the appropriate email address. To make sure that the user accepts the invitation with the appropriate email address, it's a best practice to copy the link in the invitation and then paste it into an InPrivate browsing session. Doing so makes sure that no cached credentials are used to accept the invitation.

## More information

It isn't a requirement for a guest user invitation to be accepted by using the email address to which it was sent. It's a one-time invitation. If the user accepts the invitation by using a different account, or if the user who accepts the invitation signs in to the resource by using an account other than the email address to which the invitation was sent, they might see an `Access denied` message.

For example, consider this scenario. A user is signed in through a browser by using a Microsoft account, and the user receives an email invitation to their external user account in their email application. Then the user selects the link to accept the invitation. However, based on the user's browser cookies, the user accepts the invite by using the incorrect identity. So when the user signs in to the resource by using their external user account, they  receive the error that the user isn't found in the directory.
