# Error when an external user tries to access SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business

## Symptoms

When you try to access SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business as an external user, you receive one of the following error messages:

- Access Denied
- You need permission to access this site
- User not found in the directory

## Cause

Many scenarios can generate these messages. The most frequent cause is that permissions for the user or administrator are configured incorrectly or not configured at all.

## Resolution

Use the appropriate method for the situation in which the user receives the error message.

### An external user is accessing a site

1. Determine which <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/understanding-permission-levels" target="_blank">permission level</a> (member, owner, and so on) the user should have to the site. Then, verify the permissions through the **Check Permissions** feature, as follows:

   1. Navigate to the User.aspx page. To do this, select the gear icon in the upper-right corner, select **Site Permissions**, and then select **Advanced permissions settings**.

        For example, the full URL will resemble the following: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/user.aspx`

    2.	On the ribbon, select **Check Permissions**.
    3.	In the **User** or **Group** field, type the user's name, and then select **Check Now**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > This command displays the type of permissions that the user has on a site and which security group is the permissions are derived from (if applicable).
2.	If the user does not have appropriate permissions, grant the permissions to the <a href="https://support.office.com/article/share-sharepoint-files-or-folders-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank">file</a> or <a href="https://support.office.com/article/share-a-site-958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US" target="_blank">site</a> for the user.
3. If the user continues to receive an error message, remove the user from the site by using the following steps.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This option is available only if the user previously browsed to the site collection. Users are not listed if they are granted access but never visit the site.

   1. Browse to the site, and edit the URL by adding the following string to the end of it: `/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0`

      For example, the full URL resembles the following: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0`
   1. On the list, select the user, open the Actions menu, and then select **Delete Users from Site Collection**.
   1. Grant the permissions to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-sharepoint-files-or-folders-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank">file</a> or <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-a-site-958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US" target="_blank">site for the user</a>.
   
4. If there are still errors with the account after the previous steps, we recommend that you completely remove the guest account from M365:
    1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin.
    2. In the left pane, select **Users** > **Guest users**.
    3. Select **Delete a user**.
    4. Select the **user**, then **Select**, and then select **Delete**.

        Once the above action has been completed, ensure the account is completely removed from the site collection you are sharing with the user.

    5. Browse to the site, and edit the URL by adding the following string to the end of it: `/_layouts/15/people.aspx?MembershipGroupId=0`

        For example, the full URL resembles the following: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0`
    6. On the list, select the user, open the **Actions** menu, and then select **Delete Users from Site Collection**.
    7. Grant the permissions to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-sharepoint-files-or-folders-1fe37332-0f9a-4719-970e-d2578da4941c" target="_blank">file</a> or <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/share-a-site-958771a8-d041-4eb8-b51c-afea2eae3658?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US" target="_blank">site for the user</a>.

### An external user accepts a SharePoint Online invitation by using another account

To resolve this issue, determine which account accepted the invitation, remove the incorrect account (if itâ€™s necessary), and then re-invite the user to the resource.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Many examples in this article use \<contoso> as a placeholder. In your scenario, replace \<contoso> with the domain that you use for your organization.

#### Determine which account has access as an external user

If you can access the site as the incorrect external user, follow these steps:

1. Sign in as the external user account that you used to accept the invitation.
2. Select the profile image in the upper-right corner, and then select **My Settings**.
3. In the **Account** field, review the email address. For example, i:0#.f|membership|JonDoe@contoso.com.<br/>
   > [!NOTE]
   > In this example, \<*JonDoe\@contoso.com*> is the email account that accepted the user invitation.
4. If the address is incorrect, go to the "Remove the incorrect external user account" section.

If you can't access the site as the incorrect external user, follow these steps:

1. As a SharePoint Online administrator, sign in to the site collection that was shared with the external user.
2. Select the gear icon for the **Settings** menu, and then select **Site settings**.
3. In the **Users and Permissions** section, select **People and groups**.
4. At the end of the URL in your browser window, after the **people.aspx?** part of the URL, replace **MembershipGroupId=\<number>** with **MembershipGroupId=0**, and then press Enter.
5. In the list of users, locate the name of the external user. Right-click the username, and copy the shortcut.
6. In a new browser window or tab, paste the URL that you copied in the previous step into the address box. Add **&force=1** to the end of the URL, and then press Enter.
7. In the **Account** field, review the email address. For example, i:0#.f|membership|JonDoe\@contoso.com.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this example, \<*JonDoe\@contoso.com*> is the email account that accepted the user invitation.

8. If the address is incorrect, go to the "Remove the incorrect external user account" section.

#### Remove the incorrect external user account

External users are managed on a site collection-by-site collection basis. An external user account has to be removed from each site collection to which the account was given access. You can do this from the SharePoint Online user interface or through the SharePoint Online Management Shell, depending on your version of Office 365.

For Office 365 Small Business subscriptions, use the SharePoint Online UI. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Browse to the Office 365 admin center at https://portal.office.com.
2. In **service settings**, select **Manage Organization-wide settings**.
3. Select **sites and document sharing** from the left-side menu, and then select **Remove individual external users**.
4. Select the external user who has to be removed, and then select the **Delete** icon.

All other subscriptions must use the SharePoint Online Management Shell by following these next steps.

> [!NOTE]
> This option doesn't apply to Office Small Business (P) organizations.

1. Download and install the SharePoint Online Management Shell. For more information, see [Introduction to the SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://support.office.com/article/introduction-to-the-sharepoint-online-management-shell-c16941c3-19b4-4710-8056-34c034493429?ocmsassetID=HA102915057&CorrelationId=6f224f8f-1905-463f-8999-9dc7feec8d8a&ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US).
2. Start the SharePoint Online Management Shell.
3. Type the following cmdlet:

    ```cmdlet
    $cred = Get-Credential
    ```

4. In the **Windows PowerShell Credential required** dialog box, type your admin account and password, and then select **OK**.
5. Connect to SharePoint Online, and then type the following cmdlet:

    ```cmdlet
    Connect-SPOService -Url https://<contoso>-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $cred
    ```

6. Remove the user from each site collection. To do this, type the following cmdlets, and press Enter after each:

   ```
   $ExtUser = Get-SPOExternalUser -filter <account@contoso.com>
   ```

   ```
    Remove-SPOExternalUser -UniqueIDs @($ExtUser.UniqueId)
   ```


    > [!NOTE]
    > In the first cmdlet, replace \<*account\@contoso.com*> with the affected account. 

The following steps remove the external user's ability to access SharePoint Online. However, the user will still appear in any people searches and within the SharePoint Online Management Shell **Get-SPOUser** cmdlet. To remove the user completely from SharePoint Online, you must remove the user from the UserInfo list. To do this, you can use either of the following methods.

- **Use the SharePoint Online UI.** To do this, browse to each site collection to which the user previously had access, and then follow these steps:

   1. At the site collection, edit the URL by adding the following string to the end of the URL:

      ```
      _layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0
      ```

      For example, the full URL will resemble the following:

      ```
      https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/people.aspx/membershipGroupId=0
      ```

   2. Select the user from the list.
   3. On the ribbon, select **Remove User Permissions**.

- **Use the SharePoint Online Management Shell.** 

For more information about how to use this tool, see [Introduction to the SharePoint Online Management Shell](https://support.office.com/article/introduction-to-the-sharepoint-online-management-shell-c16941c3-19b4-4710-8056-34c034493429).

> [!NOTE]
> This option doesn't apply to Small Business subscriptions.

   1. Start the SharePoint Online Management Shell.
   2. Type the following cmdlet:
 
      ```
      $cred = Get-Credential
      ```

      In the Windows PowerShell Credential required window, type your admin account and password, then select OK.

   3. Connect to SharePoint Online, and then type the following cmdlet:

      ```
      Connect-SPOService -Url https://<contoso>-admin.sharepoint.com -Credential $cred
      ```

   4. Remove the user from each site collection. To do this, type the following cmdlets, and press Enter after each:
  
      ```
      Get-SPOUser -Site https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com | FT â€“a
      ```

      ```
      Remove-SPOUser -Site https://<contoso>.sharepoint.com -LoginName live.com#jondoe@company.com
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > In the first cmdlet, notice the external user's **Login Name** in the returned results. As an external user, it might have a "live.com#" prefix if it's a Microsoft account.<br/><br/>
      > In the second cmdlet, replace \<*live.com#jondoe\@company.com*> with the user in your scenario.

Next, you have to remove the account from Azure Active Directory. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Azure Active Directory PowerShell Module and its prerequisites. To do this, see [Manage Azure AD using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj151815.aspx).
2. Open the Azure Active Directory PowerShell Module, and then run the following commands:

   ```
   Connect-MSOLService
   ```

   Enter your administrator credentials in the dialog box:

   ```
   Get-MsolUser -ReturnDeletedUsers -UnlicensedUsersOnly | ft -a
   ```

3. Locate the external user who you just deleted, and then verify that they're listed.

   ```
   Remove-MsolUser -RemoveFromRecycleBin -UserPrincipalName 'jondoe_contoso.com#EXT#@yourdomaint.onmicrosoft.com'
   ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this command, replace \<*jondoe_contoso.com#EXT#\@yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com*> with the specific user in your scenario.

#### Clear the browser cache

SharePoint Online uses browser caching in several components, including in the People Picker. A user who is fully removed from the system may remain in the browser cache. Clearing the browser cache resolves this issue. To do this for Internet Explorer, follow the steps from [Viewing and deleting your browsing history](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17438).

When you clear the cache, make sure that you also select the **Cookies and website data** option.

#### Re-invite the external user

After you follow these steps, re-invite the external user to the site by using the desired email address. To make sure that the user accepts with the appropriate email address, it is a best practice to copy the link in the invitation and then paste it into an InPrivate Browsing session. This makes sure that no cached credentials are used to accept the invitation.

## More information

An external user invitation doesn't require that it be accepted by the email address to which it was first sent. It is a one-time invitation. If another user accepts the invitation, or if the user who accepts the invitation signs up by using an account other than the email address to which the invitation was sent, you may encounter an access denied message.

For example, a user is signed in through a browser by using a Microsoft account, and the user receives an email invitation to the user's external user account in the user's email application. Then, the user selects the link to accept the invitation. However, based on the user's browser cookies, the user accidentally accepts the invitation by using the incorrect identity.

When the user signs in to the resource by using the user's external user account, the user receives the error message that the user isn't found in the directory.
