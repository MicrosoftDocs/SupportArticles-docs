# "Everyone except external users" group is removed on Microsoft 365 private group website

## Symptoms

You notice that the `Everyone except external users` group is removed on a Microsoft 365 private group website after it is converted from a public group.

## Cause

This behavior is by design.

By default, the `Everyone except external users` claim is added to the Members group on public group sites. It will be removed if the group is changed to Private at the time of the conversion.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Create a separate SharePoint permissions group.
2. Assign to the new group the same permissions role as that of the original group.
3. Add the `Everyone except external users` group to the new group.

After you make this change, the claim is removed from only the default Members group.
