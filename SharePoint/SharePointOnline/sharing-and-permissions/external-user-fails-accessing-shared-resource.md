# An external user receives an error message when they click the link to a shared resource in SharePoint Online

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a newly created file in Microsoft SharePoint Online, and you select the option to share the file with a user.
- The file is located in a library where the **Require documents to be checked out before they can be edited?** option is set to **Yes**, and the file has never been checked in.

When a user clicks the link to the file in this scenario, they receive one of the following error messages:

- **The webpage cannot be found**
- **404 NOT FOUND**

## Solution

To resolve this issue, check in the affected file before you share it. To do this, click the ellipsis button (â€¦) for the affected file, click the second ellipsis, find the **Advanced** section, and then click **Check In**.

This must be performed by an administrator or by the user who created the file.

> [!NOTE]
> When the **Require Check Out** option for the library is set to **Yes**, newly created files can't be shared until they're checked in.

## More information

This issue occurs because the document that you're trying to share is checked out to a user.
