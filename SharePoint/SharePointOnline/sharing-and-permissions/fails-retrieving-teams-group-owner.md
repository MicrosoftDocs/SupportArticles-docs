# Creator of Microsoft Teams group is listed as a SharePoint admin

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You use Microsoft Teams to create a new group.
- You locate the SharePoint site of the created group.
- The activity web parts displays an activity for the site creation.

In this scenario, the activity mentions that the site was created by another user, for example:

"*SomeUser* created the site"

## Cause

In certain scenarios, SharePoint can't retrieve the group owner. In these scenarios, SharePoint will list the first site administrator of the root site collection in the site creation activity.

## Solution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Locate the tenant root site (for example, https://*TenantPrefix*.sharepoint.com).
1. Locate **Site Settings** > **Site Collection**.
1. Add your CompanyAdministrator as the first entry in the **Administrators** field.

## More information

Microsoft is aware of the issue and working to improve the user experience.
