# External users can't find users in the people picker in SharePoint Online

## Problem

An external user tries to share a Microsoft SharePoint Online resource with a Microsoft 365 user. But when the external user types either the other user's name or a partial email address, the people picker doesn't return results.

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, external users must type the complete email address of the internal users to share anything within SharePoint Online with those users.

## More information

This issue occurs because external users can't run Active Directory queries in the people picker in SharePoint Online.
