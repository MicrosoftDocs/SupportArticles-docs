# Error: ResponseStatusNotOK when sharing a SharePoint or OneDrive site

## Symptoms

When users in your organization try to share a SharePoint or OneDrive site with external users, they receive one of the following error messages:

- Error: ResponseStatusNotOK, message: This invitation is blocked by cross-tenant access settings.
- At least one invitation failed. Error: ResponseStatusNotOK, message: Guest invitations not allowed for your company.

## Cause

This error usually occurs because of restrictions in the [B2B collaboration](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/what-is-b2b) settings in your organization.

## Resolution

To fix the error, make sure that the appropriate settings for your organizationâ€™s needs are configured for external and B2B collaboration:

- [Microsoft cloud settings](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-cloud-settings)
- [Cross-tenant access settings](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/cross-tenant-access-settings-b2b-collaboration)
