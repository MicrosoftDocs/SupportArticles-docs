# "External sharing is disabled for the site" error when a delegated partner administrator tries to access a client's SharePoint Online Admin Center

## Problem

When a delegated partner administrator tries to access the SharePoint Online Admin Center of one of the partner's clients in Microsoft SharePoint Online, he or she receives the following error message:

**External sharing is disabled for the site.**

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use the SharePoint Online management shell to delete the external user account from the client's organization. To do this, run the following cmdlet:

```
Remove-SPOExternalUser
```

For more information about this cmdlet, go to the following Microsoft websites:

- [Remove-SPOExternalUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/sharepoint-online/Remove-SPOExternalUser?view=sharepoint-ps)

- [What is the SharePoint Online Management Shell?](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-online/introduction-sharepoint-online-management-shell?view=sharepoint-ps)

## More information

This issue occurs when the account that the delegated partner administrator uses for sign-in was originally invited to the SharePoint Online site of the partner's client as an external user. External user permissions override a delegated partner's permissions. This prevents external users from accessing the SharePoint Online Admin Center.
