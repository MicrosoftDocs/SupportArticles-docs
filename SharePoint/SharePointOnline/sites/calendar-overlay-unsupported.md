# The "HTTP request is unauthorized" error in a SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server calendar after you configure a calendar overlay to Exchange Online

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a calendar overlay in Microsoft SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server.
- You configure the calendar overlay to do the following:
  - Retrieve a calendar from Microsoft Exchange Online
  - Display the calendar within the SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server calendar

In this scenario, information from the Exchange Online calendar isn't displayed in SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server. Additionally, you receive the following error message, which is displayed above the calendar:

**The HTTP request is unauthorized with client authentication scheme 'Ntlm'. The authentication header received from the server was 'Basic Realm=""'.**

## Solution
