# Classic usage and popularity reports to be discontinued

## Introduction

This article contains information about changes to the Classic usage and popularity reports. We will continue to update this article as more information becomes available. 

## More information

Site admins for classic sites could use the popularity reports to understand the usage of their sites. The popularity reports provide historical data for a period of 3 years on the usage of their sites, site collections, document libraries, folders and items. To understand these reports better, please review [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/view-popularity-trends-and-most-popular-items).

These reports are in the process of being removed and will no longer be available after 29th February 2020. Users would instead have to use the modern Site Usage report. The data represented in the modern Site Usage report includes data from Classic sites as well as from modern sites.

### What will happen to the existing data?

The data from the classic popularity reports will not be available after 29th February 2020. If required, you can download and save historical data from these reports.

### Where can I find my data in the future? 

Site usage data for Classic sites wonâ€™t be available from popularity reports from 1st March 2020. You would be able to get site usage data from the modern Site Usage page. Clicking "Popularity trends" from Site settings will automatically redirect you to the modern Site Usage page, where you can access usage data for the last 90 days. The data represented in the modern Site Usage report includes data from Classic sites as well as from modern sites. 

Please note, usage data on the modern Site Usage page may not match exactly with the Classic popularity reports. To learn more about the modern Site Usage page, please review [our documentation here](https://support.office.com/article/2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e).
