# Classic usage and popularity reports to be discontinued

## Introduction

Classic usage and popularity reports are in the process of being removed and will no longer be available after **February 29th, 2020**. Instead, users will be able to find site usage data through the modern Site Usage report. The data represented in the modern Site Usage report includes data from classic sites as well as from modern sites. 

The popularity reports provide historical data for a period of 3 years on the usage of their sites, site collections, document libraries, folders and items. To understand these reports better, please review [View Popularity Trends and Most Popular Items](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/view-popularity-trends-and-most-popular-items)

## What will happen to the existing data?

The data from the classic popularity reports will not be available after February 29th, 2020. If required, you can download and save historical data from these reports prior to February 29th, 2020.

## Where can I find my data in the future?

Site usage data for classic sites won't be available in popularity reports starting March 1st, 2020. Instead, get site usage data from the modern **Site Usage** page:

1. Select **Popularity trends** from **Site settings** to view the **Site Usage** page.
1. Now, you can access usage data for the last 90 days. The data represented in the modern **Site Usage** report includes data from classic sites as well as from modern sites. 

Usage data on the modern Site Usage page may not match exactly with the classic popularity reports. Learn more about the modern [Site Usage](https://support.office.com/article/2fa8ddc2-c4b3-4268-8d26-a772dc55779e) page.
