## Cause

The homepage of the SharePoint site might have been deleted.

## Resolution

Check whether the homepage is in the recycle bin or site collection recycle bin. For more information about how to recover files from those locations, see [Restore items in the recycle bin that were deleted from SharePoint or Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/restore-items-in-the-recycle-bin-that-were-deleted-from-sharepoint-or-teams-6df466b6-55f2-4898-8d6e-c0dff851a0be).

If the homepage isn't in the recycle bin or site collection recycle bin, do either of the following.

**Make an existing page the homepage**

1. Go to the Site Pages library.

   Example Site Pages library URL:
   `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/SitePages/Forms/ByAuthor.aspx`

1. Select the three vertical dots after the name of the page that you want to use as the homepage.
1. Select **Make homepage**.

**Create a new homepage**

1. Go to the Site Pages library.
1. Select **New** > **Site page**.
1. Enter the page content.
1. Select **Save as draft** > **Publish**.
1. Go back to the Site Pages library, and select the three vertical dots after the page name.
1. Select **Make homepage**.
