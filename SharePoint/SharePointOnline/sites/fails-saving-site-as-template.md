# "Sorry, something went wrong" error when you try to save a site as a template in SharePoint Online or SharePoint Server

## Problem

When you try to save a site as a template in SharePoint Online, SharePoint Server 2013, 2016 or 2019, you receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
Sorry, something went wrong
Sorry, this site can't be saved as a template. It contains apps that don't work in templates: 
<name of app, or apps>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The ***name of app or apps*** placeholder represents the actual app name that appears in the error message.

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, remove any affected apps that are listed in the error message, and then save the site as a template. If you want to use the app after you save the site as a template, you'll have to add it to the site again.

> [!NOTE]
> Use caution when you remove apps to make sure that you don't lose any data that's associated with the app.

## More information

This issue occurs if the site contains apps that can't be saved as part of the template.
