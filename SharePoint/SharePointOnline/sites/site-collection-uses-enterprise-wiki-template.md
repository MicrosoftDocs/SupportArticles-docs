# A newly created SharePoint Online site uses the Enterprise Wiki template instead of the Publishing Portal template

## Problem

When you create a SharePoint Online root site collection by using the Publishing Portal template in Office 365 Enterprise, the newly created site collection uses the Enterprise Wiki template.

> [!NOTE]
> This applies to the root site collection only.

## Solution

This is expected behavior in SharePoint Online. The Publishing Portal template isn't available as a root level site collection template. If you want to use the Publishing Portal template, create the site at a location other than the root URL.
