# SharePoint Online site theme in Office 365 isn't displayed when you use Internet Explorer 8

## Problem

When you use Internet Explorer 8 to view a SharePoint Online site that has a theme applied in Office 365, the default theme is displayed instead of the configured theme.

## Solution

To resolve this issue, update your web browser. For more information about web browser support and Office 365 system requirements, see [System requirements for Office](https://products.office.com/office-system-requirements).

## More information

This issue occurs because recent changes were made to render themes in the browser instead of on the server. Office 365 is designed to work with the current or immediately preceding version of Internet Explorer. Therefore, Internet Explorer 8 can't render the themes.
