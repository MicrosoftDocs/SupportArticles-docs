# SharePoint Online sites don't automatically update to the 25 terabyte limit

## Problem

When you use Manual Site Collection Storage Management for the SharePoint Online sites, the sites don't automatically update to allow for the new 25 terabyte limit.

## Solution

To resolve this problem, you must manually increase the storage limit quota for sites. For more information about how to do this, see [Manage site collection storage limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/manage-site-collection-storage-limits).

## More Information

This issue occurs because, when you use **Manual Site Collection Storage Management**, you must increase the storage limit quota for sites manually.

**NOTE** This scenario applies only to the Site Collection quota.
