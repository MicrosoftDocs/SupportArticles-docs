When trying to delete a SharePoint site, you might get an error stating the site can't be deleted, such as:

- Can't delete site
- This site has a compliance policy set to block deletion
- The requested operation is not supported for site
- A compliance policy is currently blocking this site deletion

The above errors are a sample of the possible errors. There are several other errors that will state the site can't be deleted.
