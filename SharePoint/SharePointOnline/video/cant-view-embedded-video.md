# Can’t view embedded Stream video in Teams app

When a Stream video is embedded in a SharePoint site, and then that page is added as a tab in Microsoft Teams, you can’t view it within the Teams app. You might see the following error:

> To see this content, sign in to Microsoft Stream.

Stream is unable to authenticate if you’re viewing the video in the Teams app. Microsoft is working to fix this issue, and this article will be updated with more information later.

In the meantime, you can work around this issue by opening the SharePoint site in a new window and viewing the video there, or use Teams in your browser instead of the app.

You can also solve this problem by adding your Work account in the Windows **Access work or school** settings. Stream will then be able to authenticate and play the video. For instructions on adding your Work account, see [Add or remove accounts on your PC](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/add-or-remove-accounts-on-your-pc-104dc19f-6430-4b49-6a2b-e4dbd1dcdf32).
