# "Sorry, something went wrong" when you change the "Summary Links" Web Part in SharePoint Online

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a Microsoft SharePoint Online site collection that has the **SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure** option enabled.

- The site collection includes a subsite that contains a **Summary Links Web Part**.

- You save the subsite as a template by using the **Save site as template** functionality.

- You use the saved template to create another subsite in the site collection.

- You browse to the new site and then try to create a new link, edit an existing link, or change the contents or settings in the **Summary Links** Web Part.

In this scenario, you receive the following error message:

```adoc
Sorry, something went wrong

List does not exist.

The page you selected contains a list that does not exist. It may have been deleted by another user.
```

## Solution/Workaround

To work around this issue, delete and then re-create the Web Part on the page. After you have done this, populate the required links.

## More information

This issue occurs because SharePoint doesn't support **Save Site as Template** functionality when the **SharePoint Server Publishing Infrastructure** option is enabled.
