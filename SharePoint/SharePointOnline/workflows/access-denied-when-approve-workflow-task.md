# "Access denied" error when a user tries to approve an Approval Workflow task

## Problem

In SharePoint Server 2013, SharePoint Server 2010, or SharePoint Online, you use the SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform to configure an **Approval** workflow. However, when an approver tries to approve the item, he or she receives the following error message:

**Access Denied**

## Solution

To resolve this issue, grant **Edit** access to the specific task list for the workflow to the affected user.

Additionally, the user who is approving the item as part of the workflow is also required to have **Read** access to the item that's the target of the workflow.

## More information

This behavior is by design. Users who try to approve a SharePoint 2010 Approval Workflow task, but who have only **Edit** permissions to the task list item, can't view the task's form page. The user must have at least **Read** access to the workflow task list.
