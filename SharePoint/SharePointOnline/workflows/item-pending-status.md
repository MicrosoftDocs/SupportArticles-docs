# SharePoint Online item that requires content approval reverts to "Pending" status

## Problem

Consider the following scenario.

- In a Microsoft SharePoint Online library, the **Require content approval for submitted items?** option under **Library Settings, Versioning settings** is set to ***Yes***.

- You run a Microsoft SharePoint 2013 workflow on an item that's contained in the library.

- After the workflow is finished, the **Approval Status** of the item changes to ***Pending***.

## Solution

To work around this issue, disable automatic updating of the workflow status to the current stage name. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the affected workflow in SharePoint Designer 2013.

1. On the **Workflow Settings** page for the workflow, clear the **Automatically update the workflow status to the current stage name** check box.

1. Save the workflow, and then and publish it to the SharePoint website.

## More information

The status of the item changes when the workflow is run and when the **Automatically update the workflow status to the current stage name** is enabled for the workflow. This starts the approval process for the affected item.
