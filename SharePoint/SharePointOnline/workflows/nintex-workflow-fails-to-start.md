# Nintex workflow on SharePoint Online does not start

## Symptoms

When you try to run the Nintex workflow on SharePoint Online, you receive the following error message:

>Oops.. Something went wrong. Please visit status.nintex.com for the latest Nintex service status or contact your system administrator to check the health of your Microsoft 365 tenancy.

:::image type="content" source="./media/nintex-workflow-fails-to-start/nintex-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the error displaying in a browser window.":::

## Cause

This error occurs because the **DisableCustomAppAuthentication** SharePoint setting is enabled. By default, this setting is enabled for new tenants that were created after August 25, 2020.

## Resolution

In the SharePoint Online Management Shell, run the following command to verify that **DisableCustomAppAuthentication** is set to **True**:

`Get-SPOTenant | select DisableCustomAppAuthentication`

If this setting is set to **True**, set it to **False** by running the following command:

`Set-SPOTenant -DisableCustomAppAuthentication $false`

If the setting is set to **False** when you check it, or if setting the value to **False** doesn't resolve the issue, contact Nintex support or check [the Nintex support community post about this error](https://community.nintex.com/t5/Technical-Issues/Error-quot-Oops-something-went-wrong-Please-visit-status-nintex/ta-p/89612).
