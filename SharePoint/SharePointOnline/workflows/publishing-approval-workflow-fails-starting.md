# Publishing Approval workflow doesn't automatically start in SharePoint Online or in SharePoint Server on-premises

## Problem

A Publishing Approval workflow that uses the Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Workflow platform doesn't start automatically in SharePoint Online or in an on-premises installation of SharePoint Server. On the Workflow Status page, you receive the following error message:

```asciidoc
The workflow could not update the item, possibly because one or more columns for the item require a different type of information.

An error occurred in Page Approval.
```

For the on-premises installation of SharePoint Server, the Unified Logging System (ULS) log contains the following information:

```asciidoc
System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, use SharePoint Designer 2013 to publish the globally reusable workflow from the root of the site collection. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Use SharePoint Designer 2013 to sign in to the affected site.
1. On the **Site Objects** menu, click **Workflows**.
1. In the list of workflows, click the affected workflow.
1. On the **WORKFLOW SETTINGS** tab on the ribbon, click **Publish**.

## More information

This issue may occur if the user account that created the site collection or that started the Publishing Approval workflow feature was removed from the site collection.
