## Cause

This problem typically occurs after an administrator uses a service account to log on to the server for an interactive session, and then logs off. For example, an administrator may log on to a Web Front End (WFE) server by using the farm account, and then log off. This activity forces the registry keys to be unloaded in the profile of that account. This condition makes the keys unavailable for future use.  

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use either of the following methods.  

### Method 1

Do not log on to the server for interactive sessions by using a service account.  

### Method 2

Disable the related Windows User Profile Service feature. To do this, follow these steps:  

1. Open the Group Policy editor (Gpedit.msc) on the affected server.
2. Open the UserProfiles folder in the following path:  

   **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **UserProfiles**

3. Locate the **Do not forcefully unload the user registry at user logoff** setting.
4. Change the setting to **Enabled**.
