# "SharePoint Foundation administration tool has stopped working" error during a slipstream installation  

## Symptoms  

When you run a a slipstream installation of SharePoint Server 2016, you receive the following error message:

**"SharePoint Foundation administration tool has stopped working"**  

## Cause  

This error occurs because the Microsoft SharePoint Foundation administration tool (Stsadm.exe) tries to access the SharePoint farm during a slipstream installation before the farm is created.  

## Status  

You can safely ignore this message because the error does not affect the integrity of the SharePoint slipstream installation.

## Workaround  

To avoid this error, run a non-slipstream installation of SharePoint Server 2016. After the SharePoint Server 2016 installation is complete, install the SharePoint updates.

## More information  

A slipstream installation installs the product and additional product updates at the same time. To run a slipstream installation, put the .msp files from the SharePoint updates into the updates folder of the SharePoint installation media. Then, run the Setup.exe file from the SharePoint installation media.
