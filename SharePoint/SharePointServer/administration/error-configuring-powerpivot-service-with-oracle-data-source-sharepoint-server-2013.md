# Error when configuring a PowerPivot service with an Oracle data source in SharePoint Server 2013

## Symptoms
When you attempt to configure a PowerPivot-scheduled refresh with an Oracle data source in SharePoint Server 2013, you see the following error while adding the Oracle-related SSID under data source credentials:

> The provided Secure Store target application is either incorrectly configured or does not exist.

The Unified Logging Service (ULS) will also display the following details:

```

```

Credentials failed with the following exception:

```
System.ServiceModel.FaultException`1[Microsoft.Office.SecureStoreService.Server.SecureStoreServiceCredentialsNotFoundFault]: Credentials were not found for the current user within the target application 'PPIVORA'. Please set the credentials for the current user. (Fault Detail is equal to Microsoft.Office.SecureStoreService.Server.SecureStoreServiceCredentialsNotFoundFault). 423dbd9e-5d81-e070-ca0c-21267ad6b241
```

## Cause
PowerPivot and farm admin service accounts must be present in the **Members** groups under the **Secure TargetId** in the Secure Store Service (SSS).

## Resolution
Two SSIDs (one using Oracle credentials and other using Windows credentials) are required for a third party data source, such as Oracle.

Perform the following steps to see the error:

1. Browse to the **PowerPivot Gallery**.
2. Locate the workbook for which you want to **Schedule a Data Refresh**.
3. Select **Manage Data Refresh**.
4. Select **Use the data refresh account configured by the administrator**.
5. Select **Connect using the credentials saved in the Secure Store Service (SSS) to log on to the data source**.
6. Enter the ID used to look up the credentials in the SSS ID box.

Since the farm account is different from the PowerPivot account, the error appears due to a lack of permission.

## More information

The target ID created in the SSS should be a "Group" type.
