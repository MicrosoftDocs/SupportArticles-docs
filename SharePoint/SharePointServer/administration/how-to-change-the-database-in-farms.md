# How to change the database server in a SharePoint farm  

## Summary  

In a SharePoint farm, you may have to migrate databases from one server that is running SQL Server to another. If you don't use a SQL Server client alias during the SharePoint installation, or you if you have to rename the database server for various reasons (for example, after a security breach), follow the steps in this article to change the database server.   

Through good planning and high availability, you can perform these steps in a production environment without having to stop all services.   

## Change the database server  

This article assumes that all SharePoint databases are hosted on a single SQL Server instance. Adjust the parameters in these steps as necessary for your environment.   

Before you start, create a backup of the configuration database for troubleshooting in case the SharePoint farm becomes inaccessible when you perform the steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you begin, make sure that you understand this action plan. If the SharePoint farm becomes completely inaccessible, or if the configuration database becomes corrupted, you will have to restore the functionality from the latest farm backup.  

### Step 1: Create a new SQL alias on all SharePoint servers in the farm  

To do this, follow these steps:   

1. Make sure that you use a user account that's a member of the following:  
   - The Administrators group    
   - The **db_owner** fixed database role           
2. Start the SQL Server Client Network Utility (cliconfg.exe). This utility is typically located in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (32-bit) or C:\Windows\System32 (64-bit) folder.    
3. On the **General** tab, verify that TCP/IP is enabled.    
4. On the **Alias** tab, click **Add**.  
   **Note** The **Add Network Library Configuration** window appears.    
5. In the **Server alias** box, enter the name of the new SQL Server alias.    
6. In the **Network libraries** area, click **TCP/IP**.    
7. In the **Server name** box in the **Connection parameters** area, enter the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the new server that's running SQL Server, and then click **OK**.    
8. Repeat steps 2 to 7 on all SharePoint servers that connect to the instance of SQL Server that hosts the databases.      

### Step 2: Point the SharePoint databases to the new SQL alias  

This step changes the SQL Server instance pointer on all SharePoint databases. If you want to store the databases on different SQL Server instances, modify the script accordingly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SharePoint configuration database and Central Administration content database must reside on the same SQL Server instance.   
To change the SQL Server instance pointer, run the following PowerShell script in an elevated SharePoint Management Shell window:   

```  
$SPDBs = Get-SPDatabase  
 ForEach ($DB in $SPDBs)  
 {  
     $DB.ChangeDatabaseInstance('SPSQLRenamed')  
 }  
```  

To verify the change, run the following PowerShell cmdlet in an elevated SharePoint Management Shell window:   

```  
Get-SPDatabase | Select Name,Server  
```  

You should receive a result that's similar to the following example:

![DB output](./media/how-to-change-the-database-server-in-farms/db-output.png)

### Step 3: Point the default database instance for the web applications to the new SQL Server instance  

This step is required so that when you create databases without specifying the database server, they won't connect to the old SQL Server instance.  

The following action plan is going to point all databases to the same SQL Server instance (the one that serves the configuration database). Modify this script to match your requirements.   

Run the following PowerShell script in an elevated SharePoint Management Shell window:   

```  
$ConfigDB = Get-SPDatabase | ?{$_.Name -eq 'SharePoint_Config'}  
 $WebApps = Get-SPWebApplication -IncludeCentralAdministration  
 ForEach ($WebApp in $WebApps)  
 {  
     $WebApp.Parent.DefaultDatabaseInstance = $ConfigDB.ServiceInstance  
     $webapp.Parent.Update()  
     $webapp.Update()  
 }  
```  

To verify the change, run the following PowerShell cmdlet in an elevated SharePoint Management Shell window:   

```  
$webapps = Get-SPWebApplication -IncludeCentralAdministration  
 foreach ($webapp in $webapps)  
 {  
     Write-host "WebAppUrl: $($webapp.DisplayName)`tDefaultDatabaseInstance: $($webapp.Parent.DefaultDatabaseInstance.DisplayName)"  
 }  
```  

You should receive a result that resembles the following example:

![DB instance output](./media/how-to-change-the-database-server-in-farms/db-instance-output.png)   

### Step 4: Change the Distributed Cache cluster configuration  

> [!IMPORTANT]     
> This step describes how to directly modify the SharePoint configuration database. Direct database modification is generally not supported for most SharePoint-related databases. The actions that are specified here are permitted only for this specific purpose. We do not grant permission to use these steps to make any other changes.

To do this, follow these steps:   

1. Get the current configuration object from the server that's running SQL Server by using the following SQL query:  

   ```  
   SELECT [ID],[Properties]  
   FROM [SharePoint_Config].[dbo].[Objects]  
   WITH (NOLOCK)  
   WHERE Properties like '%_cacheConfigStorageLocation%'  
   ```  

2. The query returns a single row that has two columns. One column is for the GUID of the configuration item, and the other is for the content of the configuration item, as in the following example:  

   ```
   <object type="Microsoft.SharePoint.DistributedCaching.Utilities.SPDistributedCacheClusterInfo, Microsoft.SharePoint, Version=16.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=Token"><fld type="Microsoft.SharePoint.DistributedCaching.Utilities.SPDistributedCacheClusterConfigStorageLocation, Microsoft.SharePoint, Version=16.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=Token" name="_cacheConfigStorageLocation"><object type="Microsoft.SharePoint.DistributedCaching.Utilities.SPDistributedCacheClusterConfigStorageLocation, Microsoft.SharePoint, Version=16.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=Token"><sFld type="String" name="_provider">SPDistributedCacheClusterProvider</sFld><sFld type="String" name="_connectionString">Data Source=SPSQLRenamed;Initial Catalog=SharePoint_Config;Integrated Security=True;Persist Security Info=False;Enlist=False;Pooling=True;Min Pool Size=0;Max Pool Size=100;PoolBlockingPeriod=Auto;Asynchronous Processing=False;Connection Reset=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Replication=False;Connect Timeout=15;Encrypt=False;TrustServerCertificate=False;Load Balance Timeout=0;Packet Size=8000;Type System Version=Latest;Application Name=".Net SqlClient Data Provider";User Instance=False;Context Connection=False;Transaction Binding="Implicit Unbind";ApplicationIntent=ReadWrite;MultiSubnetFailover=False;TransparentNetworkIPResolution=True;ConnectRetryCount=1;ConnectRetryInterval=10;Column Encryption Setting=Disabled</sFld></object></fld><sFld type="String" name="_clusterSize">medium</sFld><sFld type="Boolean" name="_enableHA">False</sFld><sFld type="Boolean" name="_isInitialized">True</sFld><sFld type="Boolean" name="_isDataCacheSecurityEnabled">False</sFld><sFld type="Boolean" name="m_DeploymentLocked">False</sFld><fld type="System.Collections.Hashtable, mscorlib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=Token" name="m_UpgradedPersistedFields" /><fld name="m_Properties" type="null" /><sFld type="String" name="m_LastUpdatedUser">SP2016\Administrator</sFld><sFld type="String" name="m_LastUpdatedProcess">psconfigui (3536)</sFld><sFld type="String" name="m_LastUpdatedMachine">SP16APP1</sFld><sFld type="DateTime" name="m_LastUpdatedTime">Time</sFld><fld name="m_LastUpdatedStackTrace" type="null" /><sFld type="Int32" name="m_LastUpdatedThreadId">31</sFld><sFld type="Guid" name="m_LastUpdatedCorrelationId">CorrelationId</sFld></object>.
   ```

3. Copy the result into Notepad, and then replace the following with the new SQL Server instance:  

   ```
   Data Source=SPSQLRenamed;Initial Catalog=SharePoint_Config;
   ```

4. Run the following SQL command to update the configuration object:  

   ```  
   UPDATE Objects  
   SET Properties = '[content in Notepad]'  
   WHERE ID = '[GUID of the configuration object in the query result]'  
   ```  

### Step 5: Reprovision the Distributed Cache service on all Distributed Cache servers  

To do this, follow these steps:   

1. On one of the Distributed Cache servers, gracefully shut down the service by running the following PowerShell cmdlet in an elevated PowerShell prompt:  

   ```  
   Use-CacheCluster  
   Stop-CacheHost -Graceful -CachePort 22233 -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME  
   ```  

2. Wait until the service is stopped. You can monitor the status by using the following PowerShell cmdlet:  

   ```  
   Get-CacheHost  
   ```    

   When the service is stopped, you should receive a result that's similar to the following example:  

   ![cache host output](./media/how-to-change-the-database-server-in-farms/cache-host-output.png)   

3. Remove the local server from the Distributed Cache cluster by running the following PowerShell cmdlet:  

   ```  
   Remove-SPDistributedCacheServiceInstance  
   ```  

4. Restore the local server to the Distributed Cache cluster by running the following PowerShell cmdlet:  

   ```  
   Add-SPDistributedCacheServiceInstance  
   ```  

5. Open Registry Editor, and then verify that the **ConnectionString** value of the HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AppFabric\V1.0\Configuration key is updated. Here is an example:  

   ![registry](./media/how-to-change-the-database-server-in-farms/registry.png)   

6. Repeat step 1 to 5 on each of the other servers in the Distributed Cache cluster.      

### Step 6: Remove reference to the old server  

To do this, run the following PowerShell cmdlet in an elevated SharePoint Management Shell window:   

```  
$OldServer = Get-SPServer | ?{$_.Address -eq '<The name of the SQL Server to be removed>'}  
 $OldServer.Delete()  
```  

### Step 7: Verify the change  

To verify that the database server is successfully changed, run the following cmdlet:   

```  
Get-SPServer  
```  

You should receive a result that resembles the following example:   

![server output](./media/how-to-change-the-database-server-in-farms/server-output.png)
