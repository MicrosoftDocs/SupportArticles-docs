# Hybrid Picker prerequisite check fail in a consuming farm  

## Symptom  

Consider the following scenario:   

- In a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2016 cross-farm environment, you have a publishing farm (farm P) and a consuming farm (farm C).    
- You publish a User Profile service application in farm P and consume it in farm C.    
- You run the Hybrid Picker wizard in farm C.      

In this scenario, the following prerequisite check fails:

```   
The SPO365LinkSettings cmdlet is accessible on the server.
```

**Note** You may continue with the Hybrid Picker wizard. However, the changes that are made by the SPO365LinkSettings cmdlet won't be configured.  

When you run the Get-SPO365LinkSettings cmdlet in SharePoint management shell, you receive the following error message:

```       
Get-SPO365LinkSettings : UserProfileApplicationNotAvailableException_Logging :: UserProfileApplicationProxy.UserProfileApplication has null upa  
 At line:1 char:1  
 + Get-SPO365LinkSettings  
 +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
 + CategoryInfo : InvalidData: (Microsoft.Offic...GetLinkSettings:SPO365GetLinkSettings) [Get-SPO365LinkSettings], UserProfileApplicationNotAvailableException  
 + FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles.Powershell.SPO365GetLinkSetttings       
```

## Cause  

The issue occurs because running Hybrid Picker from a consuming farm that consumes the User Profile service application from a publishing farm isn't supported yet.   

## More Information  

Microsoft is aware of this issue and will address it in a future update.
