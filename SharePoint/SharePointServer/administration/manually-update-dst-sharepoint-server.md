# Update the DST information manually in SharePoint Server

In Microsoft SharePoint Server, to include the latest daylight saving time (DST) start date and time and standard time for a locale, you have to update the time zone definition file, Timezone.xml. Usually, this information is updated for most locales when you install the latest cumulative updates for SharePoint Server. However, if the Timezone.xml file can't be updated automatically, you might experience one of the following scenarios:

- The specific constraints of your environment make it difficult to install the latest cumulative updates as soon as they become available.
- The updated DST information for your locale isn't available in the latest cumulative update.
- Cumulative updates are no longer available for your version of SharePoint Server.

## Update Timezone.xml manually

If an automatic update isn't possible, update the Timezone.xml file manually on all SharePoint servers in the farm by using the DST information and standard time for the affected locales. Follow these steps:

1. In a text editor, such as Notepad, open the Timezone.xml file from the following folder path:

   `%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\16\CONFIG`
1. Locate the time zone information that you want to modify. For example, locate *(UTC+12:00) Auckland, Wellington* in the following file information:

   ```xml
   <TimeZone ID="17" Name="(UTC+12:00) Auckland, Wellington" Hidden="FALSE" KeyName="New Zealand Standard Time">
     <Bias>-720</Bias>
     <StandardTime>
       <Bias>0</Bias>
       <Date>
         <Month>3</Month>
         <Day>3</Day>
         <Hour>2</Hour>
       </Date>
     </StandardTime>
     <DaylightTime>
       <Bias>-60</Bias>
       <Date>
         <Month>10</Month>
         <Day>1</Day>
         <Hour>2</Hour>
       </Date>
     </DaylightTime>
   </TimeZone>
   ```

   If the **DayOfWeek** element isn't specified, its value is assumed to be **0**. This value indicates Sunday. The value is incremented by 1 for each day through a value 
   of **6** for Saturday. In this example, because the value of **DayOfWeek** isn't specified, the standard time begins on the third Sunday in March while DST begins on 
   the first Sunday in October.
1. Add a [History](/sharepoint/dev/schema/history-element-regional-settings) element to the [TimeZone](/sharepoint/dev/schema/timezone-element-regional-settings) element to preserve the existing time zone definition. In the **Year** attribute of the **History** element, specify the last year for which the time zone definition applies.
1. Update the [StandardTime](/sharepoint/dev/schema/standardtime-element-regional-settings) and [DaylightTime](/sharepoint/dev/schema/daylighttime-element-regional-settings) elements by using the correct date and time for the current period.

   The following example shows the **TimeZone** element from step 2 by using the following updates:

   - The standard time has been modified to the first Sunday in April at 03:00 (3:00 AM).
   - The DST has been modified to the fifth (or last) Sunday of September at 02:00 (2:00 AM).
   - The history of these settings is preserved for the calendar year 2006 and the years that precede it.

   ```xml
   <TimeZone ID="17" Name="(UTC+12:00) Auckland, Wellington" Hidden="FALSE" KeyName="New Zealand Standard Time">
     <Bias>-720</Bias>
     <StandardTime>
       <Bias>0</Bias>
       <Date>
         <Month>4</Month>
         <Day>1</Day>
         <Hour>3</Hour>
       </Date>
     </StandardTime>
     <DaylightTime>
       <Bias>-60</Bias>
       <Date>
         <Month>9</Month>
         <Day>5</Day>
         <Hour>2</Hour>
       </Date>
     </DaylightTime>
     <History Year="2006" Name="nz2007">
       <Bias>-720</Bias>
       <StandardTime>
         <Bias>0</Bias>
         <Date>
           <Month>3</Month>
           <Day>3</Day>
           <Hour>2</Hour>
         </Date>
       </StandardTime>
       <DaylightTime>
         <Bias>-60</Bias>
         <Date>
           <Month>10</Month>
           <Day>1</Day>
           <Hour>2</Hour>
         </Date>
       </DaylightTime>
     </History>
   </TimeZone>
   ```

1. Do steps 2 through 4 for all time zones that have to be updated, and then save the Timezone.xml file.  

> [!NOTE]
> After you modify the Timezone.xml file, if you install a SharePoint Server update, your modified version of the file might be overwritten. Therefore, you must also verify that your time zone requirements are still being met after an update, and adjust the Timezone.xml file as necessary.
