# NullReferenceException with Products Configuration Wizard  

## Symptoms  

You may experience the following issues:   

- When you use the SharePoint Products Configuration Wizard, it fails during task 8 and returns the following error message:  

   ```
   Failed to install the application content files.  
   This is a critical task. You have to fix the failures before you can continue.   
   An exception of type System.NullReferenceException was thrown. Additional exception information: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.   
   To diagnose the problem, review the application event log and the configuration log file located at:C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\15\LOGS\        
   ```

   And the following error is recorded in the PSCDiagnostics log file:
