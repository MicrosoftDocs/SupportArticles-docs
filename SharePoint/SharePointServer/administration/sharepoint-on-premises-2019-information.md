# Information about SharePoint On-Premises 2019

Last year at Ignite, we announced that Microsoft Office 2019 will ship in the fall of 2018. Previews will be available in the second quarter of 2018. This includes apps (Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, and Skype for Business) and servers (Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, and Skype for Business).

Microsoft Office 2019 will provide five years of mainstream support with two years of extended support as an exception to the 10-year [Fixed Lifecycle Policy term](https://support.microsoft.com/help/14085). This seven years term will align with the support period for Microsoft Office 2016.

## Additional information

Microsoft Office 2019 will be supported on:

- Any supported Windows 10 Semi-Annual Channel
- Windows 10 Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) 2018
- The next LTSC release of Windows Server

The Microsoft Office 2019 client apps will be released with Click-to-Run installation technology only. We will not provide MSI as a deployment methodology for Microsoft Office 2019 clients. We will continue to provide MSI for Microsoft Office Server products.
