# System Center 2016 Operations Manager APM Agent causing heap corruption in SharePoint  

## Symptoms  

Heap corruption occurs in the SharePoint IIS worker process (w3wp.exe) in an environment that includes System Center 2016 Operations Manager Application Performance Monitoring (APM) Agent (Microsoft Monitoring Agent version: 8.0.10918.0).

Additionally, the following information is logged in the Windows Server application log:  

```
Image path: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\APMDOTNETAgent\V8.0.10918.0\x64\MicrosoftInstrumentationEngine_x64.dllFile version: 14.0.22325.0

```

## Cause   

This is a known issue in Operations Manager 2016. This issue occurs because the APM agent is installed and uses the .NET Framework 2.0 application pool.   

## Workaround  

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods:  

- Uninstall the Operations Manager 2016 monitoring agent.  

  **Note** You have to restart the computer to completely unload all .dll files.   

- Reinstall the Operations Manager 2016 agent without APM. To do this, run the following command:

  **msiexec /i MonAgent.msi NOAPM=1**

  **Note** The NOAPM=1 parameter causes the Operations Manager agent to install without the .NET Framework application performance monitoring.
