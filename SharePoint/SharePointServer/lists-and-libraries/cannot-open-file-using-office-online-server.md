# Something went wrong when you open a file by using an Office Web App or Office Online Server

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2761265

## Symptoms

When you try to open a file by using an Office Web App or Office Online Server, you receive the following error message:

> Error
>
> Sorry, something went wrong
>
> An error has occurred on the server.
>
> Technical Details

> Troubleshoot issues with Microsoft SharePoint Foundation.
>
> Correlation ID: <*Correlation ID*>

## Cause

This issue occurs when you log on to the SharePoint Server by using a system account. Office Online requires the SharePoint server to pass a user token on every request. However, SharePoint Server cannot create a user token for a system account.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, don't use a system account when you log on to a SharePoint Server site.
