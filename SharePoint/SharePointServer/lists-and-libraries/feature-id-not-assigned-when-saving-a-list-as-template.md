# Feature ID not assigned when saving a list as a template  

## Symptoms  

After saving a list as a template, the file created in the template gallery does not have a feature ID or product version associated with it. Also, when creating a new list dialog, the list template is not available as an option.  

## Cause  

This can be caused by having the 'ParserEnabled' property on the SPWeb set to 'false'.  

## Resolution  

Use PowerShell to enable the 'ParserEnabled' property for the web site:  

```
$web = Get-SPWeb <url of web>  
$web.ParserEnabled = $true  
$web.Update()  
```
