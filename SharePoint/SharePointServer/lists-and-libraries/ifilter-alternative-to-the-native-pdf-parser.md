# IFilter alternatives to the native PDF parser  

Microsoft SharePoint Search versions 2019, 2016, and 2013 use a built-in parser to process PDF files and make them searchable. This built-in PDF parser is coded to handle most PDF files, but not all of them.

To mitigate the possibility of a PDF parsing failure, SharePoint 2013 Search introduced a new feature in the July 2014 cumulative update that lets you bypass the built-in PDF parser and configure the use of an iFilter instead.

Using an IFilter for PDF parsing will eventually help you to improve the PDF Parsing quality in SharePoint Search.

## PDF iFilter tool

The commercial PDF IFilter tool is available. This tool is among the most commonly used:

- [Foxit PDF IFilter (commercial)](https://www.foxitsoftware.com/products/pdf-ifilter/)

If you're experiencing PDF parsing issues when you use the SharePoint built-in PDF parser, we recommend that you try to use a PDF iFilter instead.

## Enabling support for installed PDF iFilter

Enabling third-party PDF iFilter tools can be done via SharePoint PowerShell once the iFilter has been installed on the search servers.

For example:

```
$ssa = Get-SPEnterpriseSearchServiceApplication -Identity "Search Service Application"
Set-SPEnterpriseSearchFileFormatState -SearchApplication $ssa -Identity PDF -Enable $true -UseIFilter $true
```
