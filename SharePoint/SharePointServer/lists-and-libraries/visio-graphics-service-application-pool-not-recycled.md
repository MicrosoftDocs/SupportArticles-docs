# Unable to retrieve data from the server when you display Visio files in SharePoint Server 2013

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4012706

## Symptoms

When the Visio Graphics Service application pool is not recycled for a few days in SharePoint Server 2013, you may receive the following error message when you try to display Visio files:

> Unable to retrieve data from the server. The web request failed.

Meanwhile, you may find the following entries in the ULS log:

> w3wp.exe Visio Graphics Service Web Access 9004 Warning  
> Failed to access the cache.  
> w3wp.exe Visio Graphics Service Graphics Service 8079 Critical
Failed to generate raster diagram for file `https://SERVER/sites/SITENAME/Documents/VISIODOCUMENTNAME.vsdx` page ShapeInfo Error : System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Drive:\Program Files\Microsoft Office Servers\15.0\Data\VisioServer\VisioCachexxx\VisioBundlexxx.cache  
> at Microsoft.Office.Visio.Server.GraphicsServer.DiskCache.ReadBundlePart(Bundle bundle, Int32 index)  
> at Microsoft.Office.Visio.Server.GraphicsServer.ServiceCore.GetRasterPageItem(RasterPageItemRequest request)  
> at Microsoft.Office.Visio.Server.GraphicsServer.VisioGraphicsService.GetRasterPageItem(RasterPageItemRequest request)

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you can recycle an application pool for the Visio Graphics Service daily during non-business hours.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Before recycling, make sure that access to the Visio cache isn't blocked (by permissions or antivirus software, for example).
> - When you recycle an application pool in a farm, you may receive errors for a short period.
