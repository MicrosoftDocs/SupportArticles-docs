# SharePoint crawler has insufficient permissions to crawl file shares

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You create a file share on a server that's running Windows Server 2012 or a later version, and assign Read permissions to the SharePoint crawler (content access account).
- For this file share, you set up a content source of the "File Shares" type through the SharePoint Search Service Application administration.
- You start to crawl for content source of the "File Shares" type.
- In the SharePoint Search Center, you run a search query for a file stored in the file share.

In this scenario, no search result is returned. Additionally, the following error message is generated in the crawl log:

**The crawl account did not have sufficient privileges to access the security attributes of this file or folder. Ensure the crawl account has the 'Manage auditing and security log' privilege.**

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, assign the **Manage Auditing And Security Log** (SeSecurityPrivilege) privilege to the SharePoint content access account. To do so, follow these steps on the computer that hosts the file shares:

1. Select **Start** > **Run**, type `gpedit.msc`, and then select **OK**.
1. Navigate to the following location in the Local Group Policy Editor:

   Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment

1. In the right pane, locate and right-click **Manage auditing and security log**, and then click **Properties**.
1. Click the **Add User or Group** button in the **Manage auditing and security log properties** dialog box, and then add the crawl (content access) account that the SharePoint crawler uses.
1. Click **OK** in the **Manage auditing and security log properties** dialog box.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you assign the **Manage Auditing And Security Log** permission by using a Group Policy Object (GPO), add the crawl account to the GPO.
