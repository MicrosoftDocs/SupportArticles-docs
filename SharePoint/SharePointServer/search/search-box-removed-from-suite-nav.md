# Search box removed for customers with Suite Navigation search control turned off

## Summary

Effective September 14, 2020, static layout pages on modern Microsoft SharePoint sites will no longer display the search box for users who do not use the Suite Navigation search box experience in their organization or who have turned off the feature.

## More information

Searching from the home page of the SharePoint website is not affected. Such searches will continue to provide the same results.
After this change takes effect, the following static layout pages will no longer display the search box:

- **News** (/_layouts/15/news.aspx)
- **Planner** (/_layouts/15/planner.aspx)
- **Events** (/_layouts/15/events.aspx)
- **See-All** (/_layouts/15/seeall.aspx)

Before September 14, users who opted out of the Suite Navigation search box experience will continue to see a search box on their layout pages. For team sites, the search box appears over the navigation pane. For communication sites, it appears on the site header.

Starting on September 14, the Suite Navigation search box experience will no longer be provided as part of modern layout pages.

Note that future static layouts released in SharePoint will also have the search box disabled if the Suite Navigation search box experience is disabled. 

We recommend that you consider updating your training and documentation to direct users to go to the SharePoint Site's home page in order to search.
