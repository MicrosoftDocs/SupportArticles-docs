# A Web Part that is configured to refresh automatically on a SharePoint Foundation 2010 Web page never finishes refreshing

## Symptoms

You have a virtual List Web Part that is configured to refresh automatically on a Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 Web page. However, the refresh never finishes. This problem also occurs in a Data Form Web Part (DFWP) and a regular list.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the JScript code for the automatic refresh is not processed.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, configure the Web Part or the regular list in Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the page that contains the virtual List Web Part in Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010.   
2. Click **Edit file**.   
3. Click the Web part.   
4. On the **Options** tab, click to select the **Asynchronous Update** check box.   
5. Click the **Refresh Interval** drop-down list, select an interval, and then save the settings.
