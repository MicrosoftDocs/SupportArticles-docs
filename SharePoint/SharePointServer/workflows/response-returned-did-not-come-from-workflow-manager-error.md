# "A response was returned that did not come from the Workflow Manager" error in SharePoint Server 2016

## Symptoms

When you set up SharePoint Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016 with a single WFM server, then install and configure a workflow manager with SharePoint, registering it to use "SP-WorkflowService", the workflows using SharePoint Designer fails with the following error:

```
Microsoft.Workflow.Client.AuthenticationException: A response was returned that did not come from the Workflow Manager. Status code = 401:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"/>
<title>401 - Unauthorized: Access is denied due to invalid credentials.</title>
<style type="text/css">
<!--
body{marg
```

## Cause
The "Anonymous" authentication has been disabled on the WFM server in your DEV farm.

## Resolution
Reenabling "Anonymous" authentication should fix the issue.

## More information

### How we narrowed down the issue

- We used Fiddler's ability to act as proxy and listen to end point calls between SharePoint and Workflow Manager. (https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/general-development/debugging-sharepoint-server-workflows) 
- Fiddler revealed that we were failing while putting up/updating scope information for the given workflow and its URL in WFM.

- We captured ETL traces to read workflow manager internal activities while publishing the workflow.
- Failing condition revealed that the request was not even reaching WFM internally.
- In working condition, we are updating scope information as such.

- This proved that the request was reaching WFM server but not going deep further to SB or backend. Hence the component in question was IIS. 
- We captured IIS log on WFM in house while publishing the workflow. It revealed that IIS has events in fact while publishing.

- Based on the error "You do not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials that you supplied", we explored permissions of the "Workflow Management Site" IIS virtual server on WFM in our lab. We have "Anonymous" and "Windows Authentication" set as enabled.
- Disabling "Anonymous" authentication instantly reproduced the error.
- If you are using Claims authentication (Windows claims, Forms authentication or a Trusted Identity provider), the application will be configured for Forms authentication in the web.config, along with ensuring that Anonymous Authentication and Forms Authentication are enabled in IIS configuration (https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2655719/sharepoint-authentication-settings-in-central-administration-do-not-ma) 
- We by default use windows claim authentication starting SP 2013 and WFM > SP communication happens over Oauth on top of that. 
- We identified that "Anonymous" authentication was disabled on WFM server in your DEV farm. Enabling it fixed the issue.
- We were able to publish and run the workflows successfully.
