# (Specified RunAs account is invalid) error when you configure Workflow Manager 1.0

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3026799

## Symptoms

Assume that you have installed Workflow Manager 1.0 as a part of a SharePoint Server 2013 build on a non-SharePoint server. Then, you configure a new Workflow farm in Workflow Manager 1.0. The validated service account that is provided in the Configure Service Account  section works effectively with the Active Directory administrator user. However, it does not work with the other domain\user. Additionally, you receive the following error message:

> Specified RunAs account is invalid.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue occurs because of a permissions problem.

## Resolution

The setup account or service account has read permissions in Active Directory to view a User object. However, the account does not have read permissions for CN=Computers. Read permissions are required for CN=Computers to install Workflow Manager and Service Bus. Currently, there are no workarounds for this issue.
