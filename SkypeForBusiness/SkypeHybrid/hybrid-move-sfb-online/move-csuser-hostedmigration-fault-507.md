## Problem 

In a Lync hybrid deployment, when you try to move a user to Skype for Business OnlineÂ (formerly Lync Online) by using Skype for Business Online PowerShell, you receive the following error message:

## Solution 

Before you try to move the user to Skype for Business Online, the user must be enabled for both Lync Server on-premises and Skype for Business Online. The solution is to sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center and then assign the user a license for Skype for Business Online. For more information about how to assign a license to a user, go to the following Microsoft website: [Assign or remove a license](https://docs.microsoft.com/skypeforbusiness/skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-add-on-licensing/assign-skype-for-business-and-microsoft-teams-licenses)  

## More information

After you assign a license, you may receive the error that is mentioned in the "Problem" section until the user is fully provisioned for Skype for Business Online. This can require up to 30 minutes in some cases.
