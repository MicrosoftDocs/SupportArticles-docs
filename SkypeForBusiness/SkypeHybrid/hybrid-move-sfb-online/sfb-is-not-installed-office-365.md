# Skype for Business 2016 isn't installed when you switch from Microsoft 365 Small Business Premium to Microsoft 365 Business Standard

## Problem 

Consider the following scenario:  
 
- You had a subscription to the Microsoft 365 Business Premium (P2) plan.    
- You switch to the current Microsoft 365 Business Standard subscription and then install Microsoft Office 2016.    
 
In this scenario, Skype for Business 2016 isn't installed on your computer.  

## Solution 

To fix this issue, manually install Skype for Business 2016. To do this, follow these steps:
