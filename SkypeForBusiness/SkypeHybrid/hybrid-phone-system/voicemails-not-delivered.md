# Voicemail messages aren't delivered in Teams or Skype for Business client

## Symptom 1

Voicemails aren't delivered in Microsoft Outlook clients, the Microsoft Skype for Business client, or the Microsoft Teams client. 

## Resolution for Symptom 1

To resolve this issue, check whether you have any Microsoft Exchange Server mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) enabled, or you use a third-party email system (such as Gmail).

- Exchange mail flow rules

   These rules might affect delivery of email messages. Cloud Voice Mail (CVM) service now supports mail flow rules. For example, rules can be enabled to mark as spam any email messages that have MP3 attachments. This ability means that voicemails are filtered out before they arrive in the Inbox. Check whether any such rules are enabled, and then change them accordingly. Voicemail notifications that have SPF failures will be delivered to Exchange. However, mail flow rules that analyze the SPF failures might prevent delivery of these messages to the user's mailbox and, therefore, won't be available in any endpoint.
- Third-party email systems
  
   Third-party email systems aren't supported. For more information, see [Set up Phone System voicemail](/microsoftteams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail?bc=%2fskypeforbusiness%2fbreadcrumb%2ftoc.json&toc=%2fskypeforbusiness%2ftoc.json).

   The primary issue that affects third-party email systems is that the **FROM** address is formatted for PSTN calls in a nonâ€“RFC-compliant manner. However, the Skype for Business or Teams client filters messages depending on the formatting of the **FROM** field. To fix this issue, change the mail protection filter of the third-party email system to use the "P1 sender address" (that is formatted correctly). Then, enable these kinds of email messages to pass through.

Additionally, run the following PowerShell command in a remote Exchange PowerShell session to check the `OpenDomainRoutingEnabled` setting in the Exchange Online transport configuration:

```powershell
 Get-TransportConfig | fl OpenDomainRoutingEnabled
```

If the value of `OpenDomainRoutingEnabled` is **True**, the `Content-Class` header of voicemail messages changes from `Voice-CA` to `unauthenticatedVoice-CA`. This change prevents the correct PR message class from being defined. Therefore, Teams can't correctly identify and process these messages as voicemail messages.

To fix this issue, submit a support request to [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus) to update this setting to **False** in your tenant configuration.

> [!NOTE]
> The `OpenDomainRoutingEnabled` setting is a legacy setting that's used for anti-spam detection before the implementation of Exchange Online Protection.

## Workaround for Symptom 1

Add the Cloud Service IP addresses that's listed at [Microsoft 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams) in an SPF record. Alternatively, create a transport rule to bypass the spam filtering for Cloud Voicemail that comes from those addresses.

## Symptom 2

Voicemails are delivered to email clients (such as Outlook), but don't appear in the Teams or Skype for Business client. 

### Use Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer to diagnose

Go to [Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer for Teams](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/teams), and then select **Teams Voicemail** to run the test.

If the Teams Voicemail test doesn't return any errors, but the Teams client isn't retrieving any or all voicemails that are received in email (for example, the Teams client retrieves voicemails from internal callers but not from external PSTN callers because of Exchange mail flow rules), try the following resolution.

## Resolution For Symptom 2

### Exchange Client Access Rules

Make sure that there are no [Exchange Client Access Rules](/exchange/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/client-access-rules/client-access-rules#client-access-rules-and-middle-tier-applications) that block access. 

### Exchange Web Access Rules

Make sure that there are no [Exchange Web Access Policies](/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-control-access-to-ews-in-exchange) that block access. 

### Exchange Email Connector

A change that was made in October 2018 requires one additional step when you configure Exchange on-premises support. The email item class is stripped when it's delivered through SMTP. To prevent this behavior from occurring, you must set up the connector correctly. The Skype for Business and Teams clients show voicemails only if the class is correct. To enable voicemail messages to appear in the Teams client, the message class must be `IPM.Note.Microsoft.Voicemail.UM`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Teams users that have on-premises Exchange mailboxes can use voicemail together with Teams and receive voicemail messages in Outlook. However, voicemail messages aren't available to view or play within the Teams client.
> - Voicemail messages that are protected by Rights Management Services aren't viewable in Teams. They are viewable in Outlook. However, they can be played only by using the Outlook Web client (OWA), and transcriptions can be read only in Outlook or OWA. 

### Exchange mail flow rules

Exchange mail flow rules can also affect the availability of messages in Skype for Business or Teams. If changes are made to headers, the messages won't be available in the voicemail folder that's used by these clients for retrieval. If voicemail messages are visible in Outlook but not in Teams, the problem is likely caused by changes to the message content that are preventing the messages from being deposited into the voicemail folder. To investigate, use [MFCMAPI from GitHub](https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi/releases) to view the contents of the user's Outlook **Voice Mail** folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> The bit version of MFCMAPI must match the bit version of Outlook

To access the **Voice Mail** folder, open MFCMAPI, open the user's Outlook mailbox from the MFCMAPI Quick Start menu, and then expand the **`Root Container\Finder`** folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> Third-party spam or antivirus filtering solutions can also modify voicemail headers that prevent voicemails from being available in the voicemail folder.
