# "Cannot be reached" when you dial out to a telephone number from a PSTN Conferencing meeting in Skype for Business Online

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You're enabled for Skype for Business public switched telephone network (PSTN) conferencing with Microsoft as the dial-in conferencing provider.   
- While you're connected to a Skype for Business meeting through PSTN conferencing, you try to dial-out to a telephone number so that you can add another person to the meeting.   
- The telephone number that you're dialing is in a country that's not in the following list:
  - Belgium   
  - Canada   
  - Denmark   
  - Finland   
  - France   
  - Germany   
  - Italy   
  - Netherlands   
  - Norway   
  - South Africa   
  - Spain   
  - Sweden   
  - Switzerland   
  - United Kingdom   
  - United States   
   
When you do this, you receive the following error message: 

```adoc
<number> cannot be reached.
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, have the user whom you're calling join the Skype for Business meeting by using a Skype for Business client or by calling directly into the dial-in conference.
