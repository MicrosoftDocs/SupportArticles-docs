# PSTN callers can't join a Skype for Business dial-in conference call

## Problem

When public switched telephone network (PSTN) callers try to join a Skype for Business Online dial-in conference call, they're put in the lobby and can't join the call.  

## Solution 

To allow PSTN callers to join a Skype for Business Online dial-in conference call, unlock the conference call by selecting any option other than **The meeting organizer** in the **These people don't have to wait in the lobby** list.

## More Information

This issue occurs because the conference call is locked, and the organizer doesn't receive a notification that callers are waiting in the lobby. Conference calls are locked when the **These people don’t have to wait in the lobby** option is set to **Only me, the meeting organizer** in the Outlook invite meeting options or to **The meeting organizer **in the Skype meeting options during the meeting.
