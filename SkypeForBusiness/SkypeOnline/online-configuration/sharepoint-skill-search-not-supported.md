# A Microsoft SharePoint Skill search isn't supported in Skype for Business Online

## Problem

When you search for a contact by using Skype for Business OnlineÂ (formerly Lync Online), and the search fails, Skype for Business Online displays a link that suggests that you can use the Microsoft SharePoint Skill search. However, when you try to use a SharePoint Skill search, the search fails, and you receive an error message.

## Solution

Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

If your computer previously logged on to an on-premises Office Communications Server (OCS) or Lync Server, and then the same computer logs on to Skype for Business Online, you must delete the policies that were previously pushed by the administrator. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, type regedit, and then from the search results, click **Regedit.exe**.   
2. In Registry Editor, you must delete the SPSearchInternalURL value from the following registry subkeys:
      - **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Communicator**   
      - **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Communicator**
