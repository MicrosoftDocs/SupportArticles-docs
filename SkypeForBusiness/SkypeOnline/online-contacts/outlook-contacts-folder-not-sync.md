# Outlook Skype for Business "Contacts" folder doesn't sync with Skype for Business contacts

## Problem

Consider the following scenarios:

- You add a new Skype for Business contact. But the contact doesn't appear in the Outlook Skype for Business Contacts folder.   
- You remove a contact from Skype for Business. However, the contact isn't removed from the Outlook Skype for Business Contacts folder.   
- The Outlook Skype for Business Contacts folder contains stale contact information (it isn't updating). This stale data may still sync to Skype for Business contacts.   

In these scenarios, the Outlook Skype for Business (formerly Lync) Contacts folder doesn't sync with your Skype for Business contacts as the folder previously did.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, you can remove the contacts in the Outlook Skype for Business Contacts folder (but not the Contacts folder itself). To do this, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps to remove the contacts in the Contacts folder should only be performed by an administrator. After the following steps are performed, the Contacts folder will remain, but the contacts won't. And the contacts will no longer cause stale information to replicate.

1. Download and install MFCMapi from the following Microsoft website: [MFCMAPI](https://github.com/stephenegriffin/mfcmapi).
2. Close Skype for Business and Microsoft Outlook.   
3. Open MFCMapi. If you're prompted, click **OK** on the usage notes box.

This behavior is by design. The sync between the Outlook Skype for Business Contacts folder and the Skype for Business contacts is deprecated.
