# UM-enabled mailbox migration to Exchange Online fails

## Symptoms

When you try to migrate a Unified Messaging (UM)-enabled mailbox from on-premises Microsoft Exchange Server to Microsoft Exchange Online, the migration fails and returns an error message that resembles the following: 

```AsciiDoc
Mailbox '**USER**' in the source forest is currently enabled for Unified Messaging but it can't be enabled for Unified Messaging in the target forest for the following reason: Unified Messaging isn't available in the target forest. Please fix the problem or disable the mailbox for Unified Messaging before you try the operation again.
     + CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (**USER**:MailboxOrMailUserIdParameter) [New-MoveRequest], RecipientTask
    Exception
     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : [Server=**Server**,RequestId=**RequestId**,TimeStamp=**TimeStamp**] [FailureCategory=Cmdlet-RecipientTaskException] xxxxxxxx,Microsoft.Exchange.Management.RecipientTasks.
   NewMoveRequest  
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because Exchange Online cannot find a valid target forest that you are trying to migrate to. 

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the user has an Exchange Online license. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > [Exchange Online Service Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/exchange-online-service-description.aspx) indicates that some mailbox plans don't include UM. To resolve this issue, a license must be applied for a mailbox plan that includes UM (for example, Office 365 Enterprise E3 or E5).    
2. Verify that the value of the **LicenseReconciliationNeeded** property is **False**. To do this, run the following Microsoft Online Services Module for Windows PowerShell cmdlets in the given order:  
   - Connect-MsolService    
   - Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName**UPN** |fl LicenseReconciliationNeeded    

    > [!NOTE]
    > If the value is **True**, assign an Exchange Online license to the user account. Doing this operation resets the **LicenseReconciliationNeeded** property to **False** and enables the migration to continue.    
3. Map the UM mailbox policy on the cloud and on the on-premises Exchange-based server. To do this, follow these steps:  
   1. Run the following command in Exchange Online PowerShell:

        ```powershell
        Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity "Office365UMPolicy" -SourceForestPolicyNames "OnPremisesUMPolicy"
        ```

    2. Run the following command in the on-premises Exchange Management Shell: 

        ```powershell
        Set-UMMailboxPolicy -identity "OnPremisesUMPolicy" -SourceForestPolicyNames "Office365UMPolicy"
        ```
