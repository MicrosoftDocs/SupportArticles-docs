# You can't send an IM to external contacts from Outlook Web App

## Problem

You try to start an instant message (IM) conversation in Outlook Web App with an external contact, also known as a federated contact. You do this from another Lync or Office Communications Server (OCS) organization. However, the message isn't sent, and no error message is generated.

## Solution 

> [!NOTE]
> This solution requires the assistance of an Office 365 administrator.

To resolve this issue, create a Contact object in the Exchange Admin Center, and then add the external contact’s IM address to the **Proxy Address** field. Make sure that the IM address contains the **sip:** prefix for the IM address of the external contact.

For more information about how to add the IM address as a proxy address to the external contact, use the instructions at the following Microsoft website, but make sure that you use the "sip:user2@sip-contoso.com" format for the address.

[Add or remove email addresses for a mailbox](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb123794%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx)

To send an IM to the newly created external contact, type the contact’s IM address, and then add **sip:** to the beginning of the IM address. The message should be sent successfully.

## More Information

This issue occurs when the **IM Address** field is populated only with **user2\@sip-contoso.com**. Outlook Web App uses the IM address to look for external contacts in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) that have a matching Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) address in the **ProxyAddresses** attribute in AD DS. However, the IM address in the **ProxyAddresses** attribute always includes the **sip:** prefix. If the **IM Address** field is populated only by **user2\@sip-contoso.com**, Outlook Web App won't be able to find the user, and the IM will fail. 

The IM address must also exist as a SMTP proxy address for the user account. Although the IM address doesn't have to be a primary SMTP address, it must exist so that the user and the SIP address can be located.
