# LastActive attribute gives wrong user status info in Skype for Business Online

## Symptoms

In Skype for Business Online, the **LastActive** attribute occasionally shows outdated information (for example, a user may see a colleague who was online yesterday as "Offline 88 days"). This behavior may occur even when the **LastActive** attribute is disabled. A user whose **LastActive** attribute is incorrect can resolve the inaccurate time stamp by signing out and in or by manually changing their presence. 

## Status

Microsoft has researched this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
