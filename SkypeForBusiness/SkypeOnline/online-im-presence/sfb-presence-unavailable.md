# Skype for Business presence is unavailable on the Office 365 navigation bar

## Problem

When you use any Microsoft Office 365 service other than Outlook on the web services, Skype for Business presence info is unavailable on the Office 365 navigation bar.

## More Information 

This issue occurs because Skype for Business presence in the Office 365 navigation bar is available only in Outlook on the web services, such as Mail and Calendar in Office 365. Skype for Business presence information on the Office 365 navigation bar is not available in other Office 365 services.

Note If you experience issues about Skype for Business presence in SharePoint Online lists or libraries that are using the classic list or library experience, see [Lync presence is unavailable or missing on SharePoint sites ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2813701).
