# Attendees of a broadcast can't see annotations that event team members make during a Skype Meeting Broadcast

## Problem

Event team members in a Skype Meeting Broadcast can make annotations on a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation that's given during the meeting. However, attendees of the broadcast can't see these annotations.Â 

## More Information

Annotations in a Skype Meeting Broadcast aren't supported and therefore can't be viewed by attendees of the broadcast. Event team members should avoid using this functionality.
