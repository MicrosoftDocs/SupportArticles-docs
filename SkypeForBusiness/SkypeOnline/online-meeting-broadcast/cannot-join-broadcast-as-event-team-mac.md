# You can't join a Skype Meeting Broadcast as an "Event team" member by using Skype for Business on Mac

## Problem 

Consider the following scenario:
 
- You try to join a Skype Meeting Broadcast as an Event team member.
- You have Skype for Business on Mac or Lync for Mac 2011 installed.

In this situation, the Skype for Business on Mac or Lync for Mac 2011 client does not open successfully.

## Solution

### For Skype for Business on Mac

To resolve this issue, refresh your browser. When you do this, the Skype for Business on Mac client should join the meeting.

Or, another member of the Event team can click **Invite More People** in the Skype for Business meeting, and then select the Skype for Business on Mac user in question.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Broadcast** controls aren't available to Skype for Business on Mac users. Skype Meeting Broadcast controls are available only in the following Windows clients:

- Skype for Business 2015 (build 15.0.4747 and later)
- Skype for Business 2016 (build 16.0.4227 and later)

### For Lync for Mac 2011

Lync for Mac 2011 is not supported for Skype Meeting Broadcast. Clients that use this version of Lync are not able to join as an event team member.

## More information

This is a known interoperability issue in Skype Meeting Broadcast and the Skype for Business on Mac client.
