# Can't add someone to a Skype Meeting Broadcast as an Event team member or attendee

## Problem

When you're scheduling a Skype Meeting Broadcast at [https://portal.broadcast.skype.com](https://portal.broadcast.skype.com/), you do one of the following:

- In the **Event team** section, you enter a name in the **Members** field.    
- Under **Attendees**, you select **Access = Secure**, and then you enter a name in the **Attendees** field.   

In these scenarios, the name that you entered disappears when you press Enter.

## More Information

There are certain limitations concerning which users can be listed as an Event team member or as an attendee. When you enter a member of the Event team, or when you enter names of attendees for a closed meeting, be aware of the following:


- The creator of the Skype Meeting Broadcast event is automatically a member of the Event team and can't be added again.   
- Users must be members of the same organization as the meeting organizer. External users can't be added at this point.   
- The users must be synchronized by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).   
- The accepted formats by which to enter a name are as follows:Â    
  - Email address   
  - Alias   
  - User principal name (UPN)   
  - Session initiation protocol (SIP) proxy address
