# You can't add yourself to the Members list in the "Event team" area when you create a Skype Meeting Broadcast

## Problem

Consider the following scenario:

- You create a Skype Meeting Broadcast in the [Skype Meeting Broadcast portal](https://portal.broadcast.skype.com/).   
- You enter your email address or alias in the **Members** list in the **Event team** area and then click **Check Names**.    

After you do this, your email address or alias entry disappears from the **Members** list without an error message or warning being displayed.

## More Information

When you schedule a Skype Meeting Broadcast, you're already a member of the Event team and don't have to add yourself explicitly. This avoids any potential issues of forgetting to add yourself to the Event team.
