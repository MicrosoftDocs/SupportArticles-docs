# Event Team members are repeatedly prompted for a password when they try to join a Skype Meeting Broadcast

## Problem

Consider the following scenario. 

- You're enabled for Modern Authentication in Office 365.   
- You try to join a Skype Meeting Broadcast as an **Event Team** member.    

In this situation, you're repeatedly prompted for your Office 365 password. This behavior occurs after you've joined the **Event Team** meeting and while the producer controls are being loaded. For example, this occurs when a PowerPoint presentation is uploaded or when a video feed is started. 

## Solution

To work around this issue, use an account that isn't configured for Modern Authentication as a member of the Skype Meeting Broadcast **Event Team**, and then use the producer controls. 

## More Information

Currently, the producer controls aren't supported when you're configured for Modern Authentication.
