# Users are removed from a meeting while using Skype for Business UCWA applications

When using a Skype for Business Unified Communications Web API (UCWA) application, there is a long running HTTP GET request for application events. If the GET request is closed or times out and the client isn't notified, itâ€™s unable to renew the request. The UCWA server ends the application and the user is removed from the meeting. For more information about UCWA Event Channel, read [Events in UCWA](https://docs.microsoft.com/skype-sdk/ucwa/eventsinucwa). 

In most cases, this issue can be managed in the underlying network by setting HTTP or TCP timeouts to at least 15 minutes. When using a privately managed remote network (for example, a home Wi-Fi), the network may end the connection after a long period without event activity. As a result, the user is removed from the meeting, although it may appear to the user that the session is still active and connected.
