# Error when adding a new derived SBC for Direct Routing: Cannot find specified Gateway 

## Symptoms

When adding a new derived Session Border Controller (SBC) for Direct Routing using New-CSOnlineVoiceRoute cmdlet, you receive this error message:

> "Cannot find specified Gateway" 

## Cause

New domains must have at least one user enabled for Enterprise Voice to create a voice route for a derived SBC.

## Resolution

Enable at least one user for Enterprise Voice in the newly verified domain. See the detailed steps [here](/microsoftteams/direct-routing-enable-users#configure-the-phone-number-and-enable-enterprise-voice-and-voicemail).
