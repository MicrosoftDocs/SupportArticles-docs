# Skype for Business or Lync Basic 2013 client users can't use all Skype Voice features

## Problem

When you use the Skype for Business or Lync Basic 2013 client, you discover that some Skype Voice features aren't available.

## Solution

This is the expected behavior. You must use a client version that supports the advanced Skype Voice features. For more information about Skype for Business (formerly Lync) client feature comparisons, see [Client comparison tables for Lync Server 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg425836%28v=ocs.15%29.aspx).

## More Information 

This behavior occurs because the Skype for Business and Lync Basic 2013 clients don’t support the advanced Skype Voice features. For more information, see [Collect data about Office installations by using Robust Office Inventory Scan](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh221405%28v=office.14%29.aspx).
