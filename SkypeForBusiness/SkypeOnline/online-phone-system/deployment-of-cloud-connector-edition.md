# Deployment of Cloud Connector Edition in Amazon Web Services fails

## Problem 

You try to deploy Cloud Connector Edition in Amazon Web Services, but the deployment script fails.

## More Information

This is expected behavior. There's no current workaround. We don't support deploying Cloud Connector Edition in Amazon Web Services. Deploying Cloud Connector Edition is supported only in an on-premises environment on a Hyper-V server.

Additionally, deploying Cloud Connector Edition isn't supported in Azure or in a VMware virtualization infrastructure.
