# Validating a PSTN Calling emergency address returns an abbreviated city name

## Symptoms

You validate an emergency address for your organization in the Skype for Business Administration Center. The address is validated correctlyÂ but the name of the city is abbreviated.

## Resolution

This is functioning by design. No action is required. The address is correctly validated for the organization. Office 365 administrators can safely ignore this change in the name of the city. Typically, this occurs with the name of a city located in the state of California.
