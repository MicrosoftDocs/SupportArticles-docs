# Outlook mailbox rules aren't applied to Cloud PBX voice mails

## Problem

You receive a Cloud PBX voice mail, but the Outlook mailbox rule to handle the receipt of a new voice mail isn't applied as expected.  

## Solution

This is the expected behavior. There's currently no workaround. Cloud PBX voice mail uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) to put the voice mail in the user’s Office 365 mailbox. It does this by adding the voice mail as an attachment to an email message. Therefore, the email message isn't evaluated by the Outlook mailbox rules that are processed during new voice mail delivery.

## More Information
