# Troubleshoot Microsoft 365 issues when signing in to Microsoft Skype for Business

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4087361

## Introduction

You may experience issues in Microsoft Skype for Business when signing in to the Microsoft 365 service. The problem can occur randomly after you successfully sign or when you sign in for the first time. This inconsistent behavior makes it difficult to determine the cause.

## More information

To troubleshoot Microsoft 365 issues when signing in to Skype for Business, you can use the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant (SaRA). This tool can help you automatically diagnose and fix a range of known issues related to signing in to Skype for Business.

You can download the application to your local computer, sign in with your work or school account, and choose to run the Skype for Business Sign-In diagnostic scan. The tool helps you set up a new profile and run a series of diagnostic tests. If SaRA detects a problem, the tool suggests solutions.

To download and install the tool, go to [About the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](https://support.microsoft.com/office/about-the-microsoft-support-and-recovery-assistant-e90bb691-c2a7-4697-a94f-88836856c72f).
