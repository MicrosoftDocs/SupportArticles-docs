# Troubleshoot Skype for Business Online sign-in issues for admins

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 10133

This article will begin by asking you questions about your installation and the symptoms you're experiencing. Then we'll take you through a series of troubleshooting steps and configuration checks that are specific to your situation.

The amount of time you spend will depend on the type of Office 365 installation you have, and the root causes of your sign-in issues.

## One user, or a few users here and there affected

### Access to Office 365 on the web

If the affected users can sign in to Office 365 portal at [here](https://login.microsoftonline.com), go to [Valid Skype for Business user](#valid-skype-for-business-user).

If the users can't sign in to Office 365, see the [Can't sign in to Office 365](#cant-sign-in-to-office-365) section.

### Can't sign in to Office 365

If the users can't sign in to Office 365, ask them to try the troubleshooting steps suggested in [You can't sign in to Office 365, Azure, or Intune](/office365/troubleshoot/sign-In/sign-in-to-office-365-azure-intune).

If the issue still exists, [contact support](#contact-support).

### Valid Skype for Business user

Check that the affected users have a valid Skype for Business license with the following steps:

1. Sign in at <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339" target="_blank">admin.microsoft.com</a> with your admin account.
2. Go to **Users** > **Active users**, select the user that you want to check the license status.
3. In the right pane, select **Licenses and Apps**.
4. Verify that the user is licensed for Skype for Business Online.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshoot-sign-in-issues-for-admins/verify-user-licensed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the user's license information with a license for Skype for Business Online assigned.":::

    Your user license screen may be different from this example.
5. Wait 30 minutes, and then ask the user to try signing in again.

If this method doesn't resolve your issue, [sign in on another device](#sign-in-on-another-device).

#### Sign in on to another network

If users can sign in on to a different network, for example, at home, or at a public wireless access point, [verify internal network server setup](#verify-internal-network-server-setup). If users can't, go to the [Directory synchronization](#directory-synchronization) section.

If users don't have access to a different network right now, [verify internal network server setup](#verify-internal-network-server-setup).

##### verify internal network server setup

Make sure your organization's firewall isn't blocking Lync traffic. To do to this, run the Lync Online Transport Reliability IP Probe (TRIPP) tool.

Check for blocked ports or URLs:

1. On the affected network, go to the TRIPP tool address that is nearest to the users physical location:
    1. Amsterdam, NL: `http://trippams.online.lync.com`
    1. Blue Ridge, VA: `http://trippbl2.online.lync.com`
    1. Dublin, IE: `http://trippdb3.online.lync.com`
    1. Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: `http://tripphkn.online.lync.com`
    1. San Antonio, TX: `http://trippsn2.online.lync.com`
    1. Singapore: `http://trippsg1.online.lync.com`
1. Click **Start Test**.
1. If any of the tests fail, correct your internal server settings, and then rerun the TRIPP tool to verify your changes.
1. Try signing in again.

For more information about the TRIPP tool, see [You can't connect to Skype for Business Online, or certain features don't work, because an on-premises firewall blocks the connection](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2409256).

If the issue isn't solved, does your organization have an internal firewall, proxy server, or DNS server? If yes, [verify internal DNS autodiscover settings](#verify-internal-dns-autodiscover-settings). If no, go to the [Directory synchronization](#directory-synchronization) section.

##### Verify internal DNS autodiscover settings

Make sure your internal DNS server has the CNAME and SRV records required for internal user sign-in

The following tables list Internal Lync autodiscover settings.

| Type  |Host name  |Destination  |TTL  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|CNAME     |   `sip.yourDomainName.com`     |     `sipdir.online.lync.com`    |   1 hour      |
|CNAME     |  `lyncdiscoverinternal.yourDomainName.com`       |    `webdir.online.lync.com`     |  1 hour       |

|Type |Service  |Protocol  |Port  |Weight  |Priority  |TTL  |Name  |Target  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|SRV   |_sip       |_tls         |443     |1       |100       |1 hour       |@       |`sipdir.online.lync.com`        |

If the issue still exists, see the [Directory synchronization](#directory-synchronization) section below.

###### Directory synchronization

Find out if you've set up directory synchronization:

1. In the Office 365 admin center, go to **User and groups**.
1. Check the status of Active Directory synchronization.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshoot-sign-in-issues-for-admins/check-status-of-ad-synchronization.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Active Directory synchronization status in the User and groups tab.":::

If your organization synchronizing Active Directory with Office 365 is using the Windows Azure Directory Synchronization Tool, go to [Single sign-on](#single-sign-on) section. If not, [contact support](#contact-support).

###### Single sign-on

Is your organization using single sign-on with Office 365? If yes, go to the [Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) configuration](#active-directory-federation-services-ad-fs-configuration) section.

If your organization isn't using single sign-on with Office 365, see the [Duplicate or conflicting Active Directory entries](#duplicate-or-conflicting-active-directory-entries) section.

###### Duplicate or conflicting Active Directory entries

If you had a previous version of Skype for Business Server, or a current Skype for Business installation that's not configured for hybrid, then existing user attributes carried over from your on-premises Active Directory can conflict with the online values and cause sign-in issues.

To make sure that obsolete or duplicate Active Directory entries are not causing your sign-in issues, use the Active Directory Service Interfaces Editor (ADSI Edit) to:

- Check for duplicate SIP addresses.
- Make sure the `msRTCSIP-UserEnabled` attribute for affected users is set to **TRUE**.

If the issue still exists, [contact support](#contact-support).

###### Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) configuration

Check for known Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) issues that might prevent single sign-on from working as expected. For details, see [Enterprise single sign-on users in Office 365 can't sign in to Lync Online from inside their corporate network](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2839539).

If this method doesn't solve this issue, go to the [Hybrid Deployment with on-premises Skype for Business Server](#hybrid-deployment-with-on-premises-skype-for-business-server) section.

###### Hybrid Deployment with on-premises Skype for Business Server

You have a hybrid deployment if you've set up a [shared SIP address space](/skypeforbusiness/deploy/integrate-with-exchange-server/outlook-web-app) with Skype for Business Online, and your on-premises Lync server shares a domain with your Office 365 organization.

If you have a Skype for Business Server 2015 and Skype for Business Online hybrid deployment, go to the [Skype for Business users enabled on-premises and moved to the cloud](#skype-for-business-users-enabled-on-premises-and-moved-to-the-cloud) section. If you don't have, go to [Duplicate or conflicting Active Directory entries](#duplicate-or-conflicting-active-directory-entries).

###### Skype for Business users enabled on-premises and moved to the cloud

Make sure the users have been:

1. Enabled for Skype for Business on the on-premises Skype for Business Server.
1. Licensed for Skype for Business in Office 365.
1. [Moved to Skype for Business Online](/SkypeForBusiness/hybrid/move-users-between-on-premises-and-cloud?toc=/SkypeForBusiness/toc.json).

If the issue still exists, [contact support](#contact-support).

## Everybody in a specific group or at a single location affected

### Custom domain

Office 365 creates a domain for you when you sign up (the domain name includes .onmicrosoft.com). But most companies prefer to use their own domain, like fabrikam.com, for their business email addresses and website.

If your current domain name ends in .onmicrosoft.com, you don't have a custom domain.

Are you using a custom domain with Office 365? If yes, go to the [Office version](#office-version) section. If no, go to the [Access to Office 365 on the web](#access-to-office-365-on-the-web) section.

### Office version

To check your Office 365 subscription, sign in and go to **Admin** > **Licensing**.

What type of Office 365 subscription do you have?

- [Small Business](#custom-domain-status-small-business)
- [Academic](#skype-for-business-server-and-skype-for-business-online-hybrid-deployment)
- [Midsize Business](#skype-for-business-server-and-skype-for-business-online-hybrid-deployment)
- [Enterprise](#skype-for-business-server-and-skype-for-business-online-hybrid-deployment)
