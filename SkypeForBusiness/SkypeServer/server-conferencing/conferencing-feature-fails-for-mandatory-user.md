## Cause

This issue occurs when users sign into the Lync client using a Windows Active Directory Domain Services mandatory profile. Mandatory profiles are read-only user profiles. Since changes to the mandatory profile cannot be saved, the design of the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) functionality does not allow this operation. This causes the creation of the secure keys that are needed for the creation of the focus for the Lync conference to fail.

## Resolution

Do not sign into the Lync client using a Windows Active Directory Domain Services mandatory profile when planning to use the conferencing features of the Lync client.
