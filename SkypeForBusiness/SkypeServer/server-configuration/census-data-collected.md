# Census data is now collected for all Lync 2013 (Skype for Business) and Skype for Business 2016 clients

## Summary

After you apply the latest updates, a new category of client telemetry (Census) data collection is enabled for Microsoft Lync 2013 (Microsoft Skype for Business) and Microsoft Skype for Business 2016.

## More Information

The December 8, 2015, security update enables new telemetry data collection for all clients in any on-premises, online, or hybrid Skype for Business organization.
