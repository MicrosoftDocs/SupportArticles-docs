# Lync Server Enable-CsAdForest command fails in a multi domain active directory

## Symptoms

The Lync Server Enable-CsAdForest command will fail under the following circumstances and return the error listed below:

- When used as a Lync Server active directory preparation step for an Office Communications Server and Lync Server migration coexistence scenario   
- When run in an active directory domain that does not host the pre-existing Office Communications Server RTC Universal security groups   

```adoc
PS C:\Users\Administrator.SERVER01> Enable-CsAdForest
WARNING: Enable-CsAdForest failed.
WARNING: Detailed results can be found at
"C:\Users\Administrator.CONTOSO\AppData\Local\Temp\2\Enable-CsAdForest-b299482f-b912-441c-a39c-82c2bc86b478.html".
Enable-CsAdForest : Command execution failed: Active Directory operation failed on DC01.contoso.com. The object 
"CN=RTCUniversalReadOnlyAdmins,CN=Users,DC=contoso,DC=com" does not exist. At line:1 char:18 + Enable-CsAdForest <<<< 
 + CategoryInfo : InvalidOperation: (:) [Enable-CsAdForest], ADNoSuchObjectException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : 
ProcessingFailed,Microsoft.Rtc.Management.Deployment.PrepareForestCmdlet
```

## Cause

The Enable-CsAdForest Lync Server command is designed to run from the Active Directory Domain Services forest root domain for security purposes. If the pre-existing RTC Universal security groups do not exist in the Active Directory Domain Services forest root domain the Enable-CsAdForest Lync Server command will fail with an error that is similar to the one listed in the Symptoms section of this article.

## Resolution

The Enable-CsAdForest Lync Server command has to be directed to the Active Directory Domain Services domain that hosts the pre-existing RTC Universal security groups for the forest using the -GroupDomain parameter. As listed below:

**Enable-CsAdForest -GroupDomain domain.contoso.com**

## More Information

The Lync Server Get-CsADForest command will not reveal any information that is related to the Office Communications Server forest preparation. The Office Communications Server command-line tool LcsCmd.exe can be used with the following parameters to provide an HTML report that will disclose the Active Directory Domain Services domain that hosts the pre-existing RTC Universal security groups for the forest. As listed below:

**LcsCmd /forest:<forest FQDN> /action:CheckForestPrepState**

The Office Communications Server LcsCmd.exe command listed above will provide a path location for the CheckForestPrepState HTML report that is similar to the one listed below:

"C:\Users\ADMINISTRATOR\AppData\Local\Temp\2\Forest_CheckForestPrepState[YYYY_MM_DD][HH_MM_SS].html"
