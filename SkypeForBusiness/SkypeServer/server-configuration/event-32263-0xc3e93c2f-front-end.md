# Event 32263 error 0xC3E93C2F on Front-End servers in Skype for Business Server

## Symptoms

You find the following event log entry logged on Front-End servers in Microsoft Skype for Business Server 2015, Microsoft Lync Server 2013, and Microsoft Lync Server 2010:  

```AsciiDoc
Event ID: 32263
Error code: 0xC3E93C2F(SIPPROXY_E_UNKNOWN_USER_OR_EPID), Error identifier: NotifySingle.Notify
Cause: Possible issues with the other front end or with this front end.
Resolution:
Ensure the front end is functioning correctly.  
```

## Cause

This issue occurs because client sessions sometimes don't disconnect cleanly from the Front-End server. This causes stale subscriptions to remain on the server. When a notification is generated for one of these subscriptions, the server doesn't find a valid user for that subscription. Therefore, it logs the event entry that is mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.  

## More Information

This issue can be safely ignored because it's caused by client behavior. This issue is not an indication of a server or environmental problem.
