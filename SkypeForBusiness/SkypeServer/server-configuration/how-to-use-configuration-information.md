# How to use Configuration Information in Office Communicator R2, Lync Server 2013, Lync Server 2010, or Skype for Business clients

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3026442

The Configuration Information feature in Microsoft Office Communicator (OC) R2, Lync Server 2013, Lync Server 2010, and Skype for Business clients can be used to troubleshoot Outlook integration and address book issues.

## More information

To access this information, press and hold the Ctrl key while you right-click the Communicator, Lync Server or Skype for Business icon in the notification area, and then select **Configuration Information**. The information that the Configuration Information feature retrieves occurs during logon and is typically set up by Group Policy. Although this information can be found in the log files and registry, this dialog box offers an easy way to read it. This makes Configuration Information a good starting point for troubleshooting.
