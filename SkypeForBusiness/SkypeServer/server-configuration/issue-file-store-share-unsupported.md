## Cause

This Lync server file store problem occurs because of configuration issues that involve the supported Windows file server share, the Windows file server DFS share, or the supported Server Access Network (SAN) device.

Note Network Access Storage (NAS) devices are not supported in Lync Server 2010 or Lync Server 2013 deployments. This support limitation is caused by the variable design of NAS devices that have to provide file system adaptability to the Windows Server-based computer that accesses the devices' shared file system.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Lync Server deployment hosts its shared information by using a supported file storage infrastructure. 

For information about supported Lync Server 2013 file storage configurations, see the following TechNet article:

[File storage support in Lync Server 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/gg399073.aspx)

For step by step information about configuring Lync Server 2013 file storage, see the following TechNet article:

[Configure file storage for Lync Server 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj205150.aspx)

For step by step information about moving Lync Server 2013 file storage, see the following TechNet blog post:
