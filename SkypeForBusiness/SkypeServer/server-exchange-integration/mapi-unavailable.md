# "MAPI unavailable" error in Skype for Business 2016 client

## Symptoms

In certain situations, the MAPI connection to Exchange Server may not be available to Skype for Business 2016 clients. This issue occurs in the following scenarios:

- You have a new installation of Office 2016, or you create a new Outlook 2016 profile.   
- You upgrade an existing Office 2013 installation to Office 2016, and then you create a new Outlook 2016 Exchange Server profile.   

This issue may occur for Office 365 Exchange Online or Exchange On-Premises users. When this issue occurs, the MAPI connection is unavailable to Skype for Business 2016 clients. Additionally, you may experience the following symptoms:

- The Skype for Business Configuration Information feature (hold down the Ctrl key and right-click the Skype for Business 2016 system tray icon) shows a "MAPI unavailable" status, as shown.

    ![The screenshot for MAPI status ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3147146.png)

    If you click the Conversations tab (![the conversations tab ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3147148.png)), and then you click **View more in Outlook**, you receive the following error message:

    **Your Outlook profile is not configured correctly. Contact your support team with this information.**   
- Delegate functionality may be broken. For example, you cannot schedule a meeting on behalf of someone else. When you try to create the online meeting, you receive the following error message: 

    **You do not have permissions to schedule online meetings on behalf of the owner of this account. Please contact the owner of the account to get delegate permissions in Lync.**   


## Cause

This issue occurs because Skype for Business 2016 uses the PR_PROFILE_USER property to get the free/busy information. However, Microsoft Outlook 2016 doesn't write the property as part of the Reliable Profiles feature. 

## Resolution

To fix this issue, use one of the following methods, depending on your Office installation type. See the "More Information" section to determine whether your Office installation is MSI-based or Click-to-Run.

### For MSI-based versions of Skype for Business 2016

To fix this issue, install the [July 5, 2016, update (KB3115268)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3115268) for Skype for Business 2016.

## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To work around this issue in a Click-to-Run version of Skype for Business 2016, use the Workaround in this section.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the workaround itself is supported by the Outlook team. The preliminary steps in the first procedure are unsupported. However, this procedure provides information that is required to complete the workaround. These steps also provide a method to verify that the workaround is deployed correctly and to back out the changes if it's necessary.

### Preliminary steps (unsupported)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following procedure is unsupported by the Outlook team and may cause other issues in Outlook. Use this procedure at your own risk. We do not recommend that you use this procedure. However, we are including it here because it was previously published, and you may have to have to use these steps to remove the MAPI PR_PROFILE_USER property (or registry key) after fixes are released for all Click-to-Run product channels.

1. Start Registry Editor. 

    **Windows 10**
    
    Type regedit.exe at the **Start** screen, and then tap or click **regedit** in the search results.
    
    **Windows 8.1 and Windows 8**
    
    Swipe in from the right to open the charms, select **Search**, and then type regedit.exe in the search box.
    
    **Windows 7 and Windows Vista**
    
    Click **Start**, type regedit in the **Start Search** box, and then press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click **Allow**.

2. Locate the following registry subkey:

    **HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Profiles**

3. Under this subkey, locate and expand the name of your Outlook profile. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, the profile name is "Outlook." However, your profile may have a different name if you created it manually.

4. Under the profile, locate and then expand the **9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676** key. 
5. Under the **9375CFF0413111d3B88A00104B2A6676** key, you should see a subfolder for each account that's in your profile. Select the first subfolder (00000001), and then examine the data of the **Account Name** binary value by double-clicking the value. Repeat this process until you find the **Account Name** value that includes your SMTP address. 
6. Under the \0000000x subkey that includes your SMTP address, locate the Service UID binary value. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > This value represents a GUID (for example, c3 d1 9a 7b 80 1b c4 4a 96 0a e5 b6 3b f9 7c 7e). 

7. Locate the subfolder in your profile that matches the GUID value that you found in step 6 (for example, \c3d19a7b801bc44a960ae5b63bf97c7e). 

8. Under the subkey from step 7, examine the **01023d0d** binary value. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > This value represents a GUID (for example, 5f cf d5 f1 ba 5c 6f 45 b3 57 cc 5e 0d 16 94 58). 

9. Locate the subfolder in your profile that matches the GUID value from step 8 (for example, \5fcfd5f1ba5c6f45b357cc5e0d169458). 

10. In this location, create a string value that's named 001e6603, as shown.

    ![String value ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186666.png)

11. Find the user's Legacy Exchange domain name (DN).

12. Press and hold Ctrl while you right-click the Outlook system tray icon. Then, select **Test E-mail AutoConfiguration**. 

13. In the dialog box that opens, clear both the **Use GuessSmart** and **Secure Guessmart Authentication** check boxes, and then click **Test**. 

14. After the test is complete, select the **XML** tab, and then locate the Legacy DN value, as shown.

    ![Auto-configure ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186667.jpg)

    Copy the legacy DN information. Although the entire tagged entry is highlighted in this screen shot, the value that you want to copy is everything between the <LegacyDN> tags. In this example, it is **/o=Contoso /ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF23SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=4ef0d05da334258afda34a7ce08a430-TestDir1**. 

15. In the registry, populate the **Value data** field by using the legacy DN information that you just copied, as shown. Then click **OK**.

### Workaround (supported)

1. Obtain the MFCMapi tool from the following CodePlex website:

    [https://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/](https://mfcmapi.codeplex.com/)   
1. Start the tool on the affected user's computer.

    ![MFCMapi](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186669.png)

3. Click **Profile**, and then click **Show Profiles**.

4. Double-click the affected user's profile. In this situation, there is only the default profile that's named "Outlook." If the user has multiple profiles, select the one that represents their primary user account that is experiencing this issue.

    ![Outlook profiles](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186670.png)

5. In the **Services** table that opens, locate the service that has the Display Name of "Microsoft Exchange," and then double-click that service to open it.

    ![Services](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186671.png)

6. In the Providers table that opens. locate and select the provider that has the SMTP address of the affected user that has no entries for "PR_PROVIDER_DISPLAY."

    ![Providers ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186672.png)

7. In the MFCMapi tool, examine the Providers window to make sure that the user's SMTP address provider is selected. Then, look for the property that's named PR_PROFILE_USER. If this property exists, go to step 10. If this property does not exist, click **Additional Properties** on the **Property** menu, and then click the **Add** button.

    ![Providers property ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186673.png)

8. In the **Property Tag** dialog box, type PR_PROFILE_USER.

    > [!NOTE]
    > MFCMapi translates the named Property Tag into the correct values, as shown. 

    ![Property tag editor ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186674.png)

9. Click **OK**. Then, click **OK** in the Additional Properties window.

    ![Additional properties ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186675.png)

10. Run Test Autodiscovery from the Preliminary steps procedure to get the affected user's Legacy Exchange DN (LegDN). Copy this information to the clipboard.

11. In the Providers window, right-click the PR_PROFILE_USER property, and then click **Edit**. 

    ![Properties editor ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186638.png)

12. Paste the user's LegDN information in the **Ansi** text box, and then click **OK**.

    ![Property Editor completed ](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186639.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > MFCMapi may now show two entries for **PR_PROFILE_USER**. This is a known display issue that can be safely ignored.

13. Optional: Use the method that is described in Workaround 1 to examine the new registry value that was created by MFCMapi and verify that it's in the correct Outlook Profile for the affected user.

    ![Outlook profiles](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186640.png)

14. Close all MFCMapi windows and Registry Editor, and then test MAPI connectivity. Also, completely log off from Skype, and verify that the program is not running.   
15. Log back on to Skype, wait a minute or two, and then check the Skype configuration. You should now see **MAPI Status** displayed as **OK**.

    ![MAPI Status](https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/Library/Images/3186916.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > It can take some time for the change to take effect. You may have to log out of Outlook and Skype for Business and then sign back in to see the change.
