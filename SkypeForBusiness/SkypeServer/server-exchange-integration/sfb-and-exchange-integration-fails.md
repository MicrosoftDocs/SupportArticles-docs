# Skype for Business and Exchange integration fails if wildcards used in AcceptedDomains entries

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a Microsoft Lync 2013 or Skype for Business server, and you have configured integration with Microsoft Exchange 2013 or 2016.   
- At least some of the users have contoso.com as primary SMTP.   
- On the Exchange server, you change the AcceptedDomains settings so that instead of contoso.com you have \*.contoso.com, as described in [Procedures for accepted domains in Exchange 2016](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/aa996314%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx).   

After this change, Skype for Business and Exchange integration starts failing. The following error message is reported in the Lync server log:

```adoc
Log Name:      Lync Server
Source:        LS Storage Service
Date:          dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss

Computer:      FE01.contoso.com
Description:

The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized. ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.
```

Also, the following details are reported if you run the command Test-CsExStorageConnectivity -SipUri "sip:bob@contoso.com" -Verbose:

```adoc

```

## Cause

Wildcard domains are not supported for server-to-server communication under AcceptedDomains.

## Resolution

The only solution is to explicitly define all accepted domains on the Exchange server and not use any wildcards.
