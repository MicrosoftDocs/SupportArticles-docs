# "Cannot find any suitable disks for database files" error message when you try to install or update Lync Server 2013 or Lync Server 2013 databases

## Symptoms

You receive the "Cannot find any suitable disks for database files. You must manually specify database paths" error message in the following scenarios:

- You try to install or update Microsoft Lync Server 2013 by using the Lync Server 2013 Deployment Wizard.   
- You try to install or update Lync Server 2013 by using Bootstrapper.exe at a command prompt.    
- You try to install or update Lync Server 2013 databases by using the Install-CsDatabase PowerShell command in the Lync Server Management Shell.    

## Cause

This issue occurs because the drive on the computer on which you try to install or update Lync Server 2013 or Lync Server 2013 databases has less than 16 GB of free space.

To install or update Lync Server 2013 databases, the drive must have at least 16 GB of free space. Therefore, when the Install-CsDatabase PowerShell command discovers that there is less than 16 GB of space on the locally detected or user specified drive, you receive the error message.

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.

**Method 1**

If the issue occurs when you try to install Lync Server 2013, make sure that the computer on which you want to install the Lync Server 2013 databases has at least 72 GB of free space on its local drives.
