# The installation of Lync 2010 will not complete using Windows Installer (MSI)

## Symptoms

You may experience one or more of the following symptoms:

- A local Windows Installer (MSI) installation for Microsoft Lync 2010 will not complete, and the following warning is displayed in the Microsoft Lync 2010 Setup dialog box:

    **Microsoft Lync 2010 must be installed by running the appropriate Lync setup executable**   
- The Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Software Installation Group Policy setting for MSI deployment methods will not complete when Lync.msi is deployed to supported Windows clients.   
- The Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2003 or Configuration Manager 2007 R2 automated deployments of the Lync.msi may not complete, or errors that are specific to the SMS environment or to the Configuration Manager environment may occur.   

## Cause

The Lync 2010 client must be installed by using the client executable file.

> [!NOTE]
> The initial installation of Lync 2010 on a supported Windows client creates the Lync.msi file in the following locations:

- %program files%\OCSetup   
- %program files(x86)%\OCSetup    

The Lync.msi file can be used to deploy the Lync 2010 client by using the local and automated deployment methods that are described in the "Symptoms" section.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
