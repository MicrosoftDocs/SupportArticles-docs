## Symptoms

- You create an online meeting, and then you select the meeting recipients from cache instead of the global address list (GAL).   
- You select the **send** option to send a meeting invitation.   

In this scenario, you receive the following error message:

**The request failed. Please try again. Make sure that you are signed in to Skype for Business.**
