# Mobile Skype for Business message content does not appear in Apple push notifications

## Symptoms

When you receive a push notification for a Microsoft Skype for Business message on your Apple iPhone or Apple iPad device, the message content is missing.

## Resolution

For security, Skype for Business for iOS update 6.26 prevents IM message content from being sent on mobile devices. Users see only the sender's name.
