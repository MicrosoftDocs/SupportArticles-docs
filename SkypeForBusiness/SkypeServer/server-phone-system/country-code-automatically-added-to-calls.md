# + is automatically added to all Skype for Business for iOS calls

## Symptoms

After you upgrade to the Skype for Business for iOS application on your iPhone or iPad, you notice that "+<**country code**>" is automatically added at the front of the number text box. This may cause a problem for customers who dial by using an extension or who have other custom dialing behavior. 

For example, customers in the **United States** that have a country code of **1**. They are used to dialing "5000" to call an internal DID. However, the dialing rules encounter "+15000" instead. In this situation, the call may fail for this user.

## Cause

The same dialing behavior in the Skype Consumer iOS application is adopted by the Skype for Business for iOS application. This includes automatically adding +<**country code**> to all calls.

## Resolution

This issue can be addressed by both the user and the Enterprise Voice administrator in the on-premises deployment.

**HOW TO FIX:**

In the Skype for Business for iOS application, the user can press and hold the **Delete** button to backspace over the +<**country code**> entry. 

Enterprise Voice administrators can manipulate dialed numbers by using normalization rules within the dial plan. They may also be able to use a trunk translation rule to do this, depending on the dial plan configuration.
