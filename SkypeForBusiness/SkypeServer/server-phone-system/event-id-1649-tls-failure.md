We see that Lync server finds the Exchange server and umdialplan but get a TLS error when the call gets reroutes to third call manager that pulls up the auto attendant setting.

## Workaround

So recommendation is: 

1. Change the dial plan to use wildcard and change UM service startup mode to use TLS
1. Reassign the certificate on server to set FQDN as subject name but unable to assign the cert on UM and UM call router service. unable to delete the old certificate 
1. Disabled the Startup mode to use TCP 4) Now remove the old cert and assigned a new certificate for UM & UM callrouterservice 
1. Assign the certificate with UM services 
1. Change start up mode back to TLS
