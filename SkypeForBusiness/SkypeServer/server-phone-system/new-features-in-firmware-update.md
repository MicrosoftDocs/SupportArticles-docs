# New features in the firmware update for Polycom VVX IP phones

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Skype for Business Online will be retired on July 31, 2021. If you haven't upgraded your Skype for Business Online users to Microsoft Teams before that date, they will be automatically scheduled for an [assisted upgrade](/microsoftteams/upgrade-assisted). If you want to upgrade your organization to Teams yourself, we strongly recommend that you begin planning your upgrade path today. Remember that a successful upgrade aligns technical and user readiness, so be sure to leverage our [upgrade guidance](/microsoftteams/upgrade-start-here) as you navigate your journey to Teams.

## Introduction 

This article describes the features of the firmware update for the Polycom VVX Phone for Skype for Business (IP phone) that supports Microsoft Skype for Business Online.


### Firmware upgrade options

Phones that are certified for the Skype for Business Cloud PBX add-on are configured to download and install new firmware automatically when updates are available. For manual control of firmware upgrades, see [Set-CsIPPhonePolicy](/powershell/module/skype/Set-CsIPPhonePolicy).

To avoid affecting core business hours, the phones receive firmware updates during off hours for specific regions. The updates are also delivered on a staggered schedule to have a minimal effect on traffic bandwidth.

### Prerequisites for Cloud PBX automatic device updates

The following prerequisites apply to automatic device updates for Cloud PBX.
- The phone must be signed in by using a Skype for Business Online user account in order to download and install the new firmware.   
- A minimum software release of 5.4.0.10182 must be deployed on the phone in order to automatically download and install the new firmware by using a device update policy.
