# Lync 2013 client experiences one-way audio after a PSTN call is put on hold

## Summary

The Microsoft Lync 2013 client may experience issues with one-way audio when the user applies the Hold feature during a call to or from the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The user of the Lync 2013 client will be unable to use the Resume feature to regain two-way audio functionality for the Voice over IP (VoIP) call.

Additionally, the Lync 2013 client displays the following error notification:

**Call could not be put on hold**

This issue may occur when the following conditions are true:

- The Media Bypass feature for the Lync Server 2013 Enterprise Voice infrastructure is enabled.   
- The Lync 2013 client's user makes a call and puts a remote PSTN user on hold by using the Lync 2013 Hold feature.
