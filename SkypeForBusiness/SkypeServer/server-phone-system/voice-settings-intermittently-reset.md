# Voice settings are intermittently reset in Skype for Business app

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario: 
- You are enabled for Enterprise Voice.    
- You use the Skype for Business app on an iOS-based or Android-based mobile phone.    
- You set **Voice Settings** to **Cellular** or **VoIP over Wi-Fi only**.    
 
In this scenario, when you join a Skype for Business meeting, the **Voice Settings**Â value is intermittently reset to **VoIP always**. 

## Cause

The issue occurs because the user isn't recognized as enabled for Enterprise Voice under some conditions.
