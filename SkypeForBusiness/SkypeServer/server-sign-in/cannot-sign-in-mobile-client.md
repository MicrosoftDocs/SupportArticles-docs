# Lync Mobile users cannot sign in after they update to client version 5.4

## Symptoms

After Lync users update to the latest Microsoft Lync Mobile 2013 client (5.4), they cannot sign in, and they receive the following error message:

**Can't verify the certificate from the server. Please contact your support team.**

Additionally, users may see the following entry or entries in the logs if the issue occurred on an iOS device:

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, install your Enterprise Root CA Certificate on the iOS Device. You can do this manually or by using the [Apple Configurator](https://www.apple.com/support/business-education/apple-configurator/). 

## More Information

The cause of each message is slightly different, but both errors are caused by the inability to verify the authenticity of a certificate or certification authority.

For more information, go to the following Apple website: 
[Digital certificates - iOS Deployment Reference](https://help.apple.com/deployment/ios/#/apddb157952e)

Or, contact [Apple Enterprise Support](https://www.apple.com/support/enterprise/) for help with managing your iOS devices.
