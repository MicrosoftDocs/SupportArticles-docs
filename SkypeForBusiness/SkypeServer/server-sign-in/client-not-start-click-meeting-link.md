# Lync or Skype for Business client does not start when you click a meeting link if the default browser is Google Chrome

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- Google Chrome is configured as your default browser.
- Your Google Chrome installation is upgraded to version 42 or a later version.
- You try to join a meeting by clicking a "Join Lync Meeting" or "Join Skype Meeting" link, and any one of the following criteria are true:
  - You click the link within any application other than Microsoft Outlook 2013.
  - The meeting organizer did not create the meeting by using the Outlook Lync or Skype for Business meeting plugin.
  - The meeting organizer is from another organization that has not configured the option to preserve the Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) for outgoing email messages. For more information, go to the following Outlook website:

    > [Manage TNEF Message Formatting with Remote Domains](https://help.outlook.com/140/gg263346.aspx)

In this scenario, when you click the "Join Lync Meeting" or "Join Skype Meeting" link, you expect the locally installed Lync or Skype for Business client to start. Instead, the default web browser starts and you are directed to the Lync Web App or Skype for Business Web App webpage. Then, you are prompted to install a plugin or you are joined to the meeting by using the web experience.

## Cause

This problem occurs because, by default, the updated version of Google Chrome deprecates and disables support for the Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI). NPAPI is currently used as part of the client detection process for the Lync or Skype for Business client when you join a meeting by clicking a link. When NPAPI is disabled, the webpage cannot determine whether you have the client installed.

## Resolution

[May 2015 cumulative update (5.0.8308.887)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2809243) for Microsoft Lync Server 2013 that enables Mac users and Windows users to join a meeting by using Lync Web App in any default browser that you set. It does not require to use NPAPI to join a meeting if Chrome is the default browser. See the following article for more information:
