# How to troubleshoot issues that you may encounter when you use the Lync 2010 mobile client for Google Android

## Introduction 

The Lync 2010 mobile client for Google Android requires a Lync account from your company organization. If you aren’t sure whether you have a Lync account, contact your company system administrator or support team.

The Lync 2010 mobile client for Google Android smartphones isn't supported on Android tablets or on other non-phone Android devices. For more information, go to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

[2691382](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2691382) 

Android smartphone devices that are supported for use with Lync 2010 for Android  This article describes how to troubleshoot some common issues that you may encounter when you use the Lync 2010 mobile client for Google Android.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're looking for help with Lync Mobile 2013 for Android phones or tablets, go to the following Microsoft websites: 

- [2806012](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2806012) Users can't sign in to Skype for Business Online by using Lync Mobile 2013

## Procedure 

### Signing in to Lync 2010 on Google Android

#### Verify your password, account information, server settings, and client version  

1. If can't sign in to Lync Mobile 2010, visit the [Lync Sign-In Troubleshooter for Users](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10054) to be guided through a series of steps to help resolve the most common sign-in issues.    
2. Make sure that you can sign in to Lync from a desktop by using Lync 2010, Microsoft Lync 2013, or Microsoft Lync for Mac 2011. If you can’t sign in from a regular desktop client, you probably can't sign in to a mobile client.    
3. Make sure that you enter the correct password. If the password is incorrect, you'll have to change it. 
4. Make sure that you enter the correct account information. Unless your administrator has told you otherwise, you probably use the same account information to sign in to Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft SharePoint, and your work computer. If you can sign in to Lync from a desktop computer, use the same information to sign in to your mobile device.

    The following table describes the sign-in fields that are required for Android users, depending on where their Lync account is located and how their account information is set up.  

    |Lync account |SIP address and UPN |Required fields|
    |-|-|-|
    |On-premises Lync server|Same|Sign-in address: SIP address; User name: Blank |
    |On-premises Lync server|Different|Sign-in address: SIP address; User name: UPN or domain\username |
    |Office 365|Same|Sign-in address: SIP address; User Name: Blank |
    |Office 365|Different|Sign-in address: SIP address; User name: UPN |

5. Verify whether **Autodetect server** is **On**. Lync tries to determine your Lync server based on your sign-in address. If it can't detect your Lync server, you may have to turn off **Autodetect server** and specify the Lync server manually.

    If **Autodetect server** is turned on but you still can’t sign in, try manually entering the internal and external discovery addresses. This doesn’t resolve the issue. However, if you can successfully sign in manually, this indicates that the **Autodetect server** option isn’t set up correctly by your administrator.  
      - For Skype for Business Online (formerly Lync Online) users in Office 365:  
         - Internal discovery address: `https://webdir.online.lync.com/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root`    
         - External discovery address: `https://webdir.online.lync.com/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root`         
      - For Lync on-premises users, contact your support team or system administrator for help with determining your internal and external discovery address. In most cases, the internal and external discovery address should resemble the following:  
         - Internal discovery address: `https://lyncdiscover.lyncFE01.contoso.local/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root`    
         - External discovery address: `https://lyncdiscover.contoso.com/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root`     
 
        > [!NOTE]
        > To access the **User name**, **Domain**, **Internal discovery address**, and **External discovery address** fields, click **Server Settings** on the sign-in screen.    
6. Make sure that you're using the latest version of the Lync 2010 mobile client for Google Android. Download the latest version from Google Play. If you receive a message that states the client version is blocked or not supported, contact your support team or administrator because the Lync server might not be set up yet for mobile clients. 

#### Connecting over Wi-Fi through an authenticating proxy  
 
If the Wi-Fi connection that's used requires authentication before you connect, Lync may not connect because it can't use the credentials to connect through a proxy. To work around this issue, connect through the mobile carrier’s data connection instead of through Wi-Fi.

#### Connecting on a network that requires certificates  
 
If your organization requires certificates to connect to their Wi-Fi or corporate network, and you receive an error message from Lync about certificates being incorrect or missing, you may have to import certificates from your company. There are apps in the Google Play store for importing and managing certificates. Contact your support team or administrator for help.
