|Split gallery participant videos|When there's no shared content in a meeting that includes more than nine remote participants, and the meeting is presented in dual front-of-room displays, video participants on a front-of-room display that have the self-preview feature might appear as audio participants.

This lets Windows update to the latest supported OS version. <br><br>**Important** The Group Policy or MDM setting must be removed (left unconfigured) and not set to **0**.

## Limitations

- Front row is currently labeled as **Preview** on the layout picker in the front-of-room display.
- Front row layout displays up to four video participants on a single front-of-room display and up to nine video participants on dual front-of-room displays. These participants are chosen from the last active speakers.
- Front row requires 1920x1080 resolution for 16:9 display or 2560x1080 resolution for 21:9 display. These displays are set to 100 percent scaling. If the chat panel on your front-of-room display shows unreadable UI, see [Change scale and resolution for front-of-room](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-operations#change-scale-and-resolution) to adjust your display settings.
- Microsoft Teams Rooms doesn't support HDCP input. HDCP input has been observed to cause issues that affect High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ingest functionality (video, audio). To avoid these issues, make sure that switches that are connected to Microsoft Teams Rooms have HDCP options turned off.

## Expected behavior

- If your Microsoft Teams Rooms device loses trust with the domain, you won't be able to authenticate into the device and open settings. For example, if you remove Microsoft Teams Rooms from the domain after it gets domain joined, trust is lost. In this situation, sign in to the device by using a local administrator account.

- A consumer TV that's used as the front-of-room display might cause stability issues in Microsoft Teams Rooms for the following reasons:
  - Inconsistent implementation of standby modes
  - Active video source selection
  - Incorrect EDID information that's communicated to the Microsoft Teams Rooms device

  Known symptoms include a black or gray screen on the front-of-room display, or the Microsoft Teams Rooms console becomes unresponsive after waking from standby mode. If you experience issues when you use consumer TVs, we recommend that you install a configurable EDID controller or EDID emulator, such as the [HD-RX-201-C-E](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-201-C-E) from Crestron, or [DR-EDID Emulator](https://fsrinc.com/fsr-products/product/dr-edid-manager-learner/category_pathway-143) from FSR Video Products Group.
