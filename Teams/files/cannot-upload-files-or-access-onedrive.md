# Error when uploading a file or accessing the OneDrive storage in Teams

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Teams, you receive one of these error messages:

### Error 1

When uploading a file in a chat, you receive this error message:

> The file <*FileName*> didn't upload.  
> The file <*FileName*> is locked.

**Note:** This error occurs while Teams is uploading the file to the OneDrive cloud storage.

### Error 2

When accessing the OneDrive cloud storage from the **Files** section, you receive this error message:

> This item might not exist or is no longer available.  
> This item might have been deleted, expired, or you might not have permission to view it. Contact the owner of this item for more information.

## Cause

These error messages occur when the document library on your OneDrive site has been changed from its default name "**Documents**" to another name.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, the document library must be renamed to **Documents**.

You must have administrator permissions or contact your administrator to make these changes.

1. In [SharePoint Designer](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=35491), open your OneDrive site.
2. Go to **All Files**.
3. Right-click the document library, select **Rename**, and rename it to **Documents**.

**Note:** We don't recommend using SharePoint Designer to perform any customization on OneDrive sites.
