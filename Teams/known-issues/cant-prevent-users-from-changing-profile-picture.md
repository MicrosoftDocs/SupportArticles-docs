# Organizations are unable to prevent users from changing profile photos

## Summary

Currently, Teams does not have a mechanism to prevent users from changing photos. 

## More information

If you have customers who would like the ability to prevent Profile Photo uploading in Teams, have them add their vote and business case to the [Microsoft Teams UserVoice](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/18600505-disable-user-ability-to-change-profile-photos).
