# Chrome version 80 users unable to sign in to some apps on the Teams platform

## Summary

After users have properly entered their password credentials to an app's sign-in page, a continuous cycle is initiated where the user is not recognized by the app and redirected back to the app's sign-in page. 

## Workaround

Use the Teams desktop client to sign in.
