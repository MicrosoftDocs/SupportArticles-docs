# Error "We couldn't add member" when adding users to Teams 

## Symptoms

When you add an internal or external member to Teams, you see the following error: 
"We couldn't add member. We ran into an issue. Please try again later." 
However, members can be added directly to Office 365 groups.

## Workaround

This issue occurs when the value **UsersPermissionToReadOtherUsersEnabled** is set to **False** in AAD. To correct the issue, change this setting to **True**.
