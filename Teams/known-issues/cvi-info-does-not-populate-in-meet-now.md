# CVI information autopopulated in a Teams Meet Now instance does not work

## Summary

If the Cloud Video Interop (CVI) information that you populated into a **Meet Now** meeting in Microsoft Teams does not work, the cause might be the status of your CVI license. To verify the license status, check with your CVI partner.

To meet right away by using working CVI coordinates, select **Meet Now** in the Teams calendar or the Outlook calendar, per the following screenshot.
