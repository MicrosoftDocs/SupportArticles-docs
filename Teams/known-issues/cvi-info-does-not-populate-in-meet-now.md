# CVI information autopopulated in a Teams Meet Now instance does not work

## Summary

Cloud Video Interop (CVI) information populated in a Meet Now instance of a meeting in Microsoft Teams, with an existing CVI license, will not work.

To meet right away, users can click New Meeting in Microsoft Teams, instead of Meet Now, and type in a meeting name and optionally invite a guest. This will schedule a meeting in your calendar with working CVI coordinates. 

## Workaround

We recommend that you schedule the meeting to populate this information.

## More information
Microsoft is researching how to enable working CVI coordinates for Meet Now scenarios and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
