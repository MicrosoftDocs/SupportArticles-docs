description: Explains why deleted messages in Teams with an @ mention will send notifications to the channel instead of the message.

# Deleted messages with an @ mention send notifications with a channel link

## Summary

When a user is "at-mentioned" (@ mentioned) in a deleted message, the notification in the feed will navigate to the channel but not to a specific message.

## More information

This is by design.
