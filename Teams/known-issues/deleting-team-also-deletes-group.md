# Deleting a team also deletes the group associated with it in Teams

## Summary

When deleting a team in Microsoft Teams, the group associated with it is also deleted. 

## More information

This is by design. Users may not realize that the underlying Office 365 Group is deleted when the team is deleted. Additionally, if the underlying Office 365 Group is deleted, the team is deleted as well. 

Additional language in Microsoft Teams provides this information to the user. This information is not present in the Office 365 Groups interface. Your help desk can recover a deleted Group/Team.
