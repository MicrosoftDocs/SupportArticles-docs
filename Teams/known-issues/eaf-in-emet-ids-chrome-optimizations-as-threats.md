# EAF policy in the EMET identifies Chromium sandbox optimizations as threats

## Symptoms

An issue has been identified with Chromium sandbox in which the Export Address Table Access Filtering (EAF) policy in the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) and in Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) incorrectly identifies Chromium sandbox optimizations as threats. This issue causes Teams to work incorrectly.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, turn off EAF for Teams. More about this issue can be found in the [EMET mitigations guidelines](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2909257/emet-mitigations-guidelines). 

## More information
For more information about Windows Defender ATP and EAF policy, see [Enable exploit protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/enable-exploit-protection).
