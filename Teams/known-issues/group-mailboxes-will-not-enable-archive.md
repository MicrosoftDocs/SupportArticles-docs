# Teams group mailboxes will not enable for archival purposes 

## Summary

Group mailboxes in Teams will not enable for archival purposes (or for creating extra storage).

## Cause

In the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center, global admins can only enable archival flags on user mailboxes, not group mailboxes. 

## Resolution

If the group mailbox is at or near capacity, [contact Microsoft Office Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/) to extend the mailbox size.
