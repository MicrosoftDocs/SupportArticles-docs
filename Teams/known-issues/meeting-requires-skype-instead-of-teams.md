# Skype for Business required for some meetings instead of Teams

## Symptoms

When joining a meeting in your calendar, Skype for Business is launched instead of Microsoft Teams.

## Cause

If the meeting was scheduled with Skype for Business, Microsoft Teams will launch Skype for Business client to complete your entrance into the meeting. Meetings scheduled within Microsoft Teams will initiate directly within the product. 

## More information

Microsoft Teams will decide whether Skype for Business is required for a user to join the meeting based on the URL included in the meeting description.
