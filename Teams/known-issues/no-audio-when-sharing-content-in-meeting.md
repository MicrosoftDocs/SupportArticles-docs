# No audio while sharing content during a live event in Microsoft Teams

## Symptoms

When you share content during a live event in Teams, audio from the shared content (such as a YouTube link or a saved video file) cannot be heard by participants.

## Resolution

To share your system audio during a live event:

1.	Open your meeting controls, and then select **Share**.
2.	Select **Include system audio**.

> [!NOTE]
> - You won't be able to include your computer's audio while you share a PowerPoint presentation or Whiteboard.
> - Currently, we support this feature on Windows devices only.
