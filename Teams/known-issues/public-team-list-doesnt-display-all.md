# Public team list does not display all teams in Teams

## Symptoms

Not all teams in the public team list are displayed in Microsoft Teams.

## Resolution

The list of public teams is based on the Microsoft Graph. If you don't see a team, try searching for it in the top right search box. Also, the team owners should communicate team names to colleagues since many teams could show up in the search results.
