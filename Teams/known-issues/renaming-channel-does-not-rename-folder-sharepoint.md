# Renaming a Teams channel does not rename the corresponding folder in SharePoint Online

## Summary

When a channel is renamed in Microsoft Teams, the folder in the SharePoint Online document library corresponding to the team does not change to match. However, the correct SharePoint Online folder name is displayed at the top of the renamed channel's **Files** tab. 

## Cause

This is by design.
