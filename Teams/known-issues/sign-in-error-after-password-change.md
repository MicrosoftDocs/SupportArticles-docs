# Sign-in error after password change in Microsoft Teams

## Symptom

You receive the following error message after changing your password:
"Either your password changed or the server needs your sign-in info again"

## Resolution

Restart the computer to supply a new modern authentication token and try to sign in again. If you still can't sign in, sign out, and then sign in again using the old (or incorrect) credentials. After it fails, enter in your correct credentials.
