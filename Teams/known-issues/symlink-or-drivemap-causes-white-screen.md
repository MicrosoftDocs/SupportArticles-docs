# Using a symlink or mapping a drive to C:\users causes Teams to start with a white screen

## Symptoms

When using a Unix symlink or mapping a drive to C:\users, the Teams app with start or launch to a white screen. 

## Cause

When Microsoft Teams is installed to Program Files using installation scripts rather than to the default location, the client will not auto-update when new versions are available.

## More information

This is by design. Make sure you install the application in the default location: `user\Appdata`. If the mapping must exist, use the web version of Microsoft Teams instead.
