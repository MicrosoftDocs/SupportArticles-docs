# Teams is slow during video meetings on laptops docked to 4K/HDR monitors

## Summary

Overall Teams performance on laptops may be affected during meetings that use video. This can occur if a laptop is docked to an external 4K or ultra-high-definition (also known as high-dynamic range or HDR) display.

## Workaround

Reduce the resource requirements for your laptop to improve the Teams experience during the meeting. To do this, try one or more of the following methods:

- Close any other applications that are running video.
- Close browser tabs that you don’t need during the meeting.
- Disconnect your monitor from the port replicator or docking station, and directly connect it to the video port on the laptop, if available.
- Change the resolution of your 4K or HDR monitor temporarily to 1920 x 1080. Instructions for doing this on Windows are located at [Change desktop icon size or screen resolution](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026956/windows-10-change-screen-resolution).
- Turn off your own video during the meeting. To do this, select **Turn camera off** in the meeting controls.
- Turn off incoming video during the meeting. To do this, select  **More actions …** > **Turn off incoming video** in the meeting controls.
- Restart your laptop.

## Resolution

Microsoft is actively working to resolve these issues, and will be releasing updates over the next several months. We’ll post more information in this article as it becomes available.
