# Teams stops working when joining from Edge or Internet Explorer 

## Symptoms

When trying to join Microsoft Teams using Edge or Internet Explorer, Teams will loop, stop working, or fail to sign in.

## Cause

Your organization utilizes Trusted Sites in Internet Explorer. The Teams web-based application will not correctly sign in if Teams are not allowed as a trusted site.

## Resolution

Make the following changes to IE or Edge settings from the Control Panel, either with Administrator rights or a Group Policy Object:

1. Under **Internet Options** > **Privacy** > **Advanced**, accept **First-Party and Third-Party cookies**, and check the box for **Always allow session cookies**.
2. Select **Internet Options** > **Security** > **Trusted Sites** > **Sites**, and add the following URLs:
   - https://login.microsoftonline.com
   - https://*.teams.microsoft.com

> [!NOTE]
> Always validate and allow all trusted URLs for Teams and the requirements from the following document: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges.](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges)
