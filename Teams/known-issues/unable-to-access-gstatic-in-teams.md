# Microsoft Teams requires access to Google Gstatic

## Symptom

You are unable to access Google Gstatic through Microsoft Teams. 

## Cause

Teams presently requires access (TCP port 443) to the Google ssl.gstatic.com service for all users; this is true even if you're not using Gstatic. Teams will remove this requirement soon (early 2020).

## Resolution

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information when the information becomes available.
