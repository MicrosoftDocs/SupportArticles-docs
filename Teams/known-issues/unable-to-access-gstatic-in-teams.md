# Microsoft Teams requires access to Google GSTATIC

## Symptom

You are unable to access Google GSTATIC through Microsoft Teams. 

## Cause

Teams presently requires access (TCP port 443) to the Google **ssl.gstatic.com** service for all users; this is true even if you're not using GSTATIC. Teams will remove this requirement soon (early 2020).

## Resolution

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information when the information becomes available.
