# Teams website tabs leads to customer confusion 

## Summary

Customers become confused by using website tabs in Microsoft Teams.

## More information

Website tabs are not equivalent to standard a web browser. A number of sites, especially those requiring authentication or using popups, will not work as expected when pinned as a website tab. Microsoft is working on improving the UI to make it clearer for customers.
