description: Some websites (such as internet portals) do not display in the Teams desktop app if Conditional Access restrictions are in place.
---

# A website with Conditional Access does not display when viewed in the Website tab 

## Symptoms

A website (such as an intranet portal) does not render as a tab inside of the Teams desktop app when that website has Conditional Access policies in place (such as browser or IP address restrictions).

## Workaround

We recommend that you use Teams in a browser instead of the desktop app.
