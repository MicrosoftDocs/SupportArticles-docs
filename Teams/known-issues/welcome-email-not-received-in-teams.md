# User does not receive welcome email when added by an administrator

## Summary

When adding a member to a team using PowerShell or the Teams admin center, they do not receive a welcome email from Microsoft Teams.

## More information

Adding a member from the Teams UI directly is the only way to send the welcome email. Currently, there is no workaround doing so administratively.
