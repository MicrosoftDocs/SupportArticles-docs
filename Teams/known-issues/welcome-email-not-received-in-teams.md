# User does not receive welcome email when added by an administrator

## Summary

When adding a member to a team using PowerShell or the Teams admin center, they do not receive a welcome email from Microsoft Teams.

## More information

[Adding a member from the Teams UI](https://support.office.com/article/add-members-to-a-team-in-teams-aff2249d-b456-4bc3-81e7-52327b6b38e9) directly is the only way to send the welcome email. Currently, there is no workaround doing so administratively.
