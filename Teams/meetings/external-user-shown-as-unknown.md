# External users appear as Unknown in meeting details

Consider the following scenario:

- An external (federated) user joins meetings and calls by using the Teams client.
- In the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), you access the call analytics information for the user:
  
     1. Under **Users** > **Manage Users**, you select the user.
     1. On the user's profile page, you select the **Meetings & calls** tab.
- You select a meeting ID to view the details.

In this scenario, the username is displayed as **Unknown** on the **Overview** page. The following screenshot shows an example.

This behavior is by design. On the meeting details page, the Teams admin center UI uses the Microsoft Graph API to query the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant for user properties, such as **displayName**. Because external users aren't available for queries, the username is displayed as **Unknown**.

For more information about call analytics, see [Set up call analytics for Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/set-up-call-analytics).
