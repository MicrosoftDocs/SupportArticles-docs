# Known issues that affect Teams webinars

Microsoft Teams recently unveiled the webinar feature as an alternative to standard meetings. To learn how to manage webinars, see [Set up for webinars in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/set-up-webinars). To learn how to use webinars, see [Get started with Teams webinars](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-teams-webinars-42f3f874-22dc-4289-b53f-bbc1a69013e3) and [Schedule a webinar](https://support.microsoft.com/office/schedule-a-webinar-0719a9bd-07a0-47fd-8415-6c576860f36a). This article discusses known issues that might occur when you use webinars, and provides resolutions and workarounds that you can try.

## The "For everyone" option is greyed out or missing

When you create a webinar, the **For everyone** option on the **Require registration** menu is unavailable (grayed out) or missing. This occurs even though the `WhoCanRegister` parameter value is set to **Everyone** by default.

This issue occurs if there's a change in the meeting policy.  

To fix this issue, reset the `WhoCanRegister` parameter value to **Everyone**, and wait 24 hours. To reset the `WhoCanRegister` parameter, run the following PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -WhoCanRegister Everyone
```

**Note:** If the "anonymous join" functionality is turned off in the meeting settings, anonymous users can't join the webinars. To enable this setting, see [Manage meeting settings in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/meeting-settings-in-teams).

## A blank screen appears when joining a webinar

When you try to join a webinar, a blank screen appears after authentication.

This issue may occur if **Require Registration** is set to **None** when the webinar is created.

To work around this issue, set **Require Registration** to **For people in your org** or **For everyone** when scheduling a webinar.
