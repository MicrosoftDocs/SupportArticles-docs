# Resolve issues that affect Teams Meeting add-in for Outlook

If you're a Microsoft Teams administrator, and your users can't install the Teams Meeting add-in for Outlook, schedule Outlook meetings from Teams, or schedule Teams meetings from Outlook, try the following steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## Check policies

Verify that the following policies are assigned to the affected users:

- A Teams Upgrade policy that enables scheduling meetings in Teams. For more information, see [Set your coexistence and upgrade settings](/microsoftteams/setting-your-coexistence-and-upgrade-settings).

- A Teams Meeting policy that enables the Outlook add-in to be installed. For more information, see [Meeting policy settings](/microsoftteams/meeting-policies-in-teams-general#outlook-add-in).

## Use the Teams Add-in Missing in Outlook diagnostic

If you're an administrator, you can use the following diagnostic tool to validate that a user has the correct policies to enable the Teams Outlook add-in.

1. Select the following **Run Tests** button to populate the diagnostic in the Microsoft 365 admin center:

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Run Tests: Teams Add-in Missing in Outlook](https://aka.ms/TeamsAdd-InDiag)

2. In the **Username or Email** field under **Run diagnostic**, enter the email address of the user who is experiencing issues when they try to enable the Teams Outlook add-in. Then, select **Run Tests**.
3. The tests will suggest next steps to resolve any tenant or policy configuration issues and validate that the user is correctly configured to enable the Teams Outlook add-in.

## Use Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant note](../../includes/sara-note-new-teams.md)]

If the policies are assigned correctly, but you still can't install the add-in, or if you're not an administrator, download and run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant by selecting the following button. The Assistant is the recommended solution to perform automated troubleshooting steps and make the required fixes.

## The Enterprise version of the Assistant

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant note](../../includes/sara-note-new-teams.md)]

If you're an administrator who has multiple users who are affected by the issues that affect the Teams Meeting add-in, you can use the Enterprise version of the Assistant. The Enterprise version of the Assistant is a command-line version that can be scripted to detect and fix most issues automatically without requiring user interaction. For details about how to use the Enterprise version of the Assistant, see [Enterprise version of Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant](/microsoft-365/troubleshoot/administration/sara-command-line-version#supported-switches).  

## Fix the issue manually

If you want to perform the checks and make the fixes manually, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the users have the Teams desktop client installed. The meeting add-in can't be installed if you use only the Teams web client.
1. Verify that the users are running Outlook 2016 or a later version.
1. Verify that all available updates for the Outlook desktop client are applied.
1. Exit Outlook.
1. Exit Teams.
1. Re-register Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll:

   1. Open File Explorer, and then navigate to the `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\TeamsMeetingAddin` folder.
   1. Select the subfolder that has a name that's the same as the version number. If there are multiple subfolders that have the same version number, select the subfolder that has the highest build number. Then, copy the path of this subfolder. For example, `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\TeamsMeetingAddin\1.0.23334.11`.
   1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window, and then run the following command that's appropriate for your Office installation:

     - For 64-bit Office

       ```powershell
       %SystemRoot%\System32\regsvr32.exe /n /i:user <path copied in step b>\x64\Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll
       ```

     - For 32-bit Office

       ```powershell
        %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\regsvr32.exe /n /i:user <path copied in step b>\x86\Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll
       ```

1. Restart the Teams desktop client.
1. Sign out and then sign in to the Teams desktop client.
1. Restart the Outlook desktop client. Make sure that Outlook isn't running in admin mode.

## Check the status of the add-in in Outlook

If you still don't see the Teams Meeting add-in, make sure that it's enabled in Outlook.

- In Outlook, select **File** > **Options**.

- In the **Outlook Options** dialog box, select the **Add-ins** tab.

- Check whether **Microsoft Teams Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office** is in the **Active Application Add-ins** list.

- If the add-in isn't in the list of active applications, and you see the Teams Meeting Add-in in the **Disabled Application Add-ins** list, select **Manage** > **COM Add-ins**, and then select **Go.**

- Select the checkbox that's next to **Microsoft Teams Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Office**.

- Select **OK** on all the dialog boxes that are open, and then restart Outlook.

## Verify registry settings

If the add-in still doesn't appear, follow these steps to check the registry settings.

> [!WARNING]
> Follow this section's steps carefully. Incorrect registry entries can cause serious system issues. As a precaution, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows).

1. Check the load behavior of the add-in:

   1. Open RegEdit.exe.
   1. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\TeamsAddin.FastConnect`.
   1. Check the value of the `LoadBehavior` entry. It should be set to **3**.
   1. If `LoadBehavior` has a value other than **3**, change it to **3**, and then restart Outlook.
  
   If the add-in still doesn't appear, go to step 2.
2. Check whether the *Configure Outlook object model prompt when reading address information* policy setting is configured:

   1. Open RegEdit.exe.
   1. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security`. If you applied the policy settings by using [Cloud Policy service](/deployoffice/admincenter/overview-cloud-policy), navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Cloud\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security`.

      **Note:** Policy settings that are implemented by using Cloud Policy take precedence over policy settings that are implemented by using Group Policy on Windows.
   1. Check for the `promptoomaddressinformationaccess` registry entry and whether a value is set for it. If the value is **0**, this indicates that the policy setting is set to the *Automatically deny* option. If it is, Outlook will automatically deny programmatic access requests from any program. In this situation, go to step 2d.
   1. Check the *Configure trusted add-ins* policy setting.

      If this policy setting is configured, Teams administrators can use one of the following options:

      - Disable or unconfigure the policy setting.
      - If the policy is required, make sure that *Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll* is in the list of trusted add-ins and that the corresponding hash value is correct. You can use the [Get-FileHash](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash) cmdlet to compute the hash value of the .dll file.

        **Note:** The *Microsoft.Teams.AddinLoader.dll* file that's used is automatically updated with the Teams client. Therefore, the hash value must be constantly updated to pair with the .dll file.
