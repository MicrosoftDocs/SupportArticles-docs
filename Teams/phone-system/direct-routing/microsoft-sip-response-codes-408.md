# Microsoft and SIP response codes

This article lists combinations of Microsoft and SIP response codes, the corresponding error messages, and actions that you can take.

## 1106 408 An acknowledgement was not received for the call acceptance in the allotted time

- Microsoft response code: **1106**
- SIP response code: **408**
- Error message: **An acknowledgement was not received for the call acceptance in the allotted time**
- Suggested actions:  
  This error indicates that the callee answered the call, but the SBC didn't acknowledge the SIP 200 OK (answer message) from Microsoft. Work with your SBC vendor to verify that the SIP stack and the underlying TCP/TLS connections are correctly established with [Microsoft connection points](/microsoftteams/direct-routing-plan#sip-signaling-fqdns).

## 500001 408 Gateway (SBC) failover timer expired

- Microsoft response code: **500001**
- SIP response code: **408**
- Error message: **Gateway (SBC) failover timer expired**
- Description:  
  Request time-out. The response can't be produced within an acceptable amount of time. Failover timer expired on an outbound call.

  When a Teams user makes an outbound call, the Direct Routing interface sends an SIP INVITE message to the SBC. If the SBC doesn't reply within the time-out value that's configured in Teams, the call is dropped. This response code is generated by the Microsoft Teams service.
- Suggested actions:  
  Investigate why the SBC didn't send a response to the invitation within the configured time-out value as defined by [FailoverTimeSeconds](/powershell/module/skype/set-csonlinepstngateway?view=skype-ps&preserve-view=true). The default value is 10 seconds.

  This error usually occurs in regions that have long PSTN setup times. Consider changing the failover timer to 20 seconds in these regions or on all Direct Routing trunks.

## 560408 408 SBC indicated that the user did not respond (request timeout)

- Microsoft response code: **560408**
- SIP response code: **408**
- Error message: **SBC indicated that the user did not respond (request timeout)**
- Description:  
  When a Teams user makes an outbound call, the Direct Routing interface sends a SIP INVITE message to the SBC. The SBC routes the message accordingly and starts a timer. If no response to the INVITE is received, the SBC returns a "408" SIP response to the Teams service. This error might be related to the dialed number or a downstream component.
- Suggested actions:  
  Review the tenant's call records with *CallEndSubReason = 560408*. Look for trends in the called numbers, or a distribution of the failures by destination country. Patterns can be identified that would suggest a problem that affects a downstream component.

## 0 408 Establishment timeout

- Microsoft response code: **0**
- SIP response code: **408**
- Error message: **Establishment timeout**
- Description:  
  ConversationEndReasonNoModalityConnected. Media wasn't established within 90 seconds. It indicates a client error.
- Suggested actions:  
  Check the network connection between the client and the Teams service.
