  - Run the Teams Voicemail connectivity test
  
    Both administrators and non-administrators can run the [Teams Voicemail](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsVoicemail/input) connectivity test in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool. This tool is used to troubleshoot connectivity issues that affect Teams. The connectivity test verifies whether a user account meets the requirements to access voicemail and the Teams client can retrieve and display voicemail messages.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool isn't available for the GCC and GCC High Microsoft 365 Government environments.

    To run the connectivity test, follow these steps:

    1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Teams Voicemail](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsVoicemail/input) test.
    1. Sign in by using the credentials of the affected user account.
    1. Enter the verification code that's displayed, and then select **Verify**.
    1. Select the checkbox to accept the terms of agreement, and then select **Perform Test**.

    After the test is finished, the screen displays details about the checks that were performed and whether the test succeeded, failed, or was successful but displayed a few warnings. Select the provided links for more information about the warnings and failures and how to resolve them.
  - If you're using GCC or GCC High environment, see [Control routing of calls to Cloud Voicemail](/MicrosoftTeams/set-up-phone-system-voicemail#control-routing-of-calls-to-cloud-voicemail).
