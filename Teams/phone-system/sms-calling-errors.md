# Resolve campaign rejection errors for SMS in Microsoft Teams

If you enable the [Short Message Service (SMS)](/microsoftteams/sms-overview) feature in Microsoft Teams, you might have to troubleshoot and resubmit [campaigns](/microsoftteams/sms-setup-campaign) that were rejected during the 10-digit-long code (10DLC) review process. After a campaign is submitted, Microsoft and 10DLC operators evaluate it for compliance with Mobile Network Operator (MNO) and industry standards. If the campaign doesn't meet these requirements, it's rejected and generates one or more error codes.

The following sections provide a comprehensive list of potential rejection errors, together with clear descriptions and actionable recommendations to help you resolve issues and successfully resubmit your campaign. The sections are organized by the categories of information that you submit to register a campaign.
