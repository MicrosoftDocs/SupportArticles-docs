# Teams owner unable to create a Planner tab

## Symptoms

When trying to create a new Planner tab in Microsoft Teams, a team owner receives this error message from the Teams client:

> "Failed to create the plan".

## Cause

The owner isn't a member of the Microsoft 365 group associated with the team. This prevents the Planner API from triggering the plan creation.

## Resolution

Add the owner as a member of the Microsoft 365 group. For more information, see [Add or remove members from Microsoft 365 groups using the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/create-groups/add-or-remove-members-from-groups?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide).
