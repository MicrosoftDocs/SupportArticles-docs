# Teams website tabs leads to customer confusion 

## Summary

Customers become confused by using website tabs in Microsoft Teams because some website elements don't load properly.

## More information

Website tabs aren't equivalent to a standard web browser. A number of sites, especially those requiring authentication, using popups, or complex HTML framing, will not work as expected when pinned as a website tab. Microsoft is working on improving the UI to make it clearer for customers.
