# Activate guest user access in the Microsoft Teams admin center

## Symptoms

You cannot add guest users in Microsoft Teams. Therefore, teams that are within your organization can't collaborate with people outside your organization.

## Resolution

By default, guest access in Teams is turned off. To enable guest access, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Org-wide settings**.
3. Select **Guest Access**.
4. Set **Allow guest access in Microsoft Teams** to **On**.

## More information

For a more detailed explanation about how to enable guest user access in Teams, see [Turn on or turn off guest access to Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/set-up-guests).
