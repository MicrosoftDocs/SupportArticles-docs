# Self-help diagnostics for Microsoft Teams administrators

## Summary

As Microsoft Teams usage grows, Microsoft has developed 17 Teams-specific diagnostic scenarios that cover top support topics and the most common tasks for which administrators request configuration help. It is important to note that while these diagnostics cannot make changes to your tenant, they do provide insight into known issues and the instructions that you’ll need to fix the issues quickly. 

## More information

While you’re logged in as an administrator, visit your [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home). In the navigation pane, select **Show all** > **Support** > **New service request**. After you briefly describe your issue (for example, “I can't invite a guest to Teams”), the system determines whether a diagnostic scenario matches your issue. 

> [!note]
> As you type search terms, a type-ahead query assists you to find the topics that you’re searching for.

Enter your organization’s root URL. In the Guest Access diagnostic, select the drop-down arrow, select a pre-populated URL from your tenant, and then select **Run tests**.

After the diagnostic checks finish and the configuration issue is found, the system provides the steps to resolve the issue. In this example, the Tenant Admin had not turned on Guest Access:
