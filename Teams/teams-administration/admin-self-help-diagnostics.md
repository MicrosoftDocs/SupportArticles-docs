# Self-help diagnostics for Microsoft Teams administrators

To keep pace with the growth in usage of Microsoft Teams, Microsoft has developed Teams-specific diagnostics that cover top support issues and configuration tasks for which administrators most commonly request help. These diagnostics can't make changes to your tenant, but they provide insights into the issues that affect them and instructions to fix the issues quickly.

Administrators can run the diagnostics from the Microsoft 365 admin center. For users who don't have administrator permissions, a set of connectivity tests are available in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool that's used to troubleshoot connectivity issues that affect Teams.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The diagnostics in the admin center aren't available for the GCC High or DoD environments, or for Microsoft 365 operated by 21Vianet.
> - The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool isn't available for the GCC and GCC High Microsoft 365 Government environments.

## Run diagnostics in the Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home) as an administrator.
1. Select the **Help & Support** floating button in the bottom right corner of the screen to open the **Help** pane.
1. In the text box, type a brief description of the issue you need help to resolve.
1. Follow the prompts, and then select **Run tests**.

After the diagnostic checks finish and the issue is found, you're provided instructions to resolve the issue. If you implement a fix that's based upon the instructions, it's a good practive to rerun the diagnostic to make sure that the issue is completely resolved.

When an IT admin runs customer diagnostics in the Microsoft 365 admin center to resolve issues without logging support requests, Microsoft makes a donation to a global nonprofit organization. For more information, see [Diagnostics for Social Good](https://aka.ms/DiagnosticsforSocialGood).

## Run connectivity tests in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool

1. Open a web browser and navigate to [Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/teams).
1. From the list of available tests, select one that applies to your issue.
1. Provide the required information.
1. Enter the verification code that's displayed, and then select **Verify**.
1. Select the checkbox to accept the terms of agreement, and then select **Perform Test**.

After the test finishes, the screen will display details about the checks that were performed and whether the test succeeded, failed, or was successful but displayed a few warnings. A link is provided to get details about warnings and failures and how to resolve them.

## Scenarios covered by diagnostics and connectivity tests

The following tables list the diagnostics that are currently available in the Microsoft 365 admin center and the connectivity tests that are available in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool. The diagnostics are organized by category together with links to access the diagnostics and connectivity tests directly, scenario descriptions, and help articles about the scenarios.
