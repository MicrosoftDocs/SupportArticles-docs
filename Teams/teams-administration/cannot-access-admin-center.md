# Error when accessing the Microsoft Teams admin center: We can't get the activity log

## Symptoms

As a Microsoft Teams administrator, you can't access the Microsoft Teams admin center at [https://admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com) with third-party cookies disabled in the browser. You receive this error:

> We can't get the activity log

## Cause

This behavior is by design. Authentication and authorization won't work as intended if the third-party cookies are disabled in the browser.

This is the recommended path that relies on browser session cookies during Microsoft Azure Active Directory authentication or authorization.

## Resolution

Enable third-party cookies from browser settings:

1. Open Edge browser.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Site permissions** > **Cookies and site data**
3. Set **Block third-party cookies** to **Disable**.
