# Clear the Teams client cache

If you're experiencing issues that affect Microsoft Teams, clearing the cache on your device may help. After you clear the cache, restart Teams.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You won't lose any user data by clearing the cache.
> - Restarting Teams after you clear the cache might take longer than usual because the Teams cache files have to be rebuilt.

1. If Teams is still running, right-click the Teams icon in the taskbar, and then select **Quit**.
2. Open the **Run** dialog box by pressing the Windows logo key :::image type="icon" source="media\clear-teams-cache\windows-logo-key.png"::: +R.
3. In the **Run** dialog box, enter *%appdata%\Microsoft\Teams*, and then select **OK**.
4. Delete all files and folders in the %appdata%\Microsoft\Teams directory.
5. Restart Teams.
