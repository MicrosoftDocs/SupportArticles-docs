# Error "We couldn't add member" when adding users to Teams

## Symptoms

When you add an internal or external member to Teams, you see the following error:

> "We couldn't add member. We ran into an issue. Please try again later."

However, members can be added directly to Microsoft 365 groups.

## Workaround

This issue occurs when the value **UsersPermissionToReadOtherUsersEnabled** is set to **False** in Azure AD. To correct the issue, change this setting to **True**.
