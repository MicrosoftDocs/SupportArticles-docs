# Resolve "FAILED_TO_AUTO_DISCOVER_DOMAIN" error

You see the FAILED_TO_AUTO_DISCOVER_DOMAIN error message when you try to connect to the Microsoft Teams admin center.

The situations that might cause this error to occur, and the solutions to resolve the error are as follows.

### SIPDomain is not enabled in the tenant

This issue can be resolved by following these steps:

1. Connect to Skype for Business Online with PowerShell:

   - [Manage Skype for Business Online with Microsoft 365 PowerShell](/office365/enterprise/powershell/manage-skype-for-business-online-with-office-365-powershell)

2. Verify that SIPDomain is enabled by running [Get-CsOnlineSipDomain](/powershell/module/skype/get-csonlinesipdomain).

3. Enable [SipDomain for the domain](/powershell/module/skype/enable-csonlinesipdomain).<br/>
   PowerShell cmdlet: `Enable-CsOnlineSipDomain -Domain <yourdomain>`

This fix can take from 15 minutes to an hour to take effect.

### No user is licensed for Skype for Business or Teams

The domain should have at least one user licensed for Skype for Business or Teams. A License admin must assign a Skype for Business license or a Teams license to a user account that has a Teams admin role.

To assign a license:

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339) with your admin account.
2. Go to the **Users** > **Active Users** page.
3. Select the user that you want to assign a license to.
4. In the right pane, select **Licenses and Apps**.
5. Expand the **Licenses** section, select the **Skype for Business Online** or **Microsoft Teams** checkbox, and then select **Save changes**.

This fix can require up to 24 hours for the synchronization to take effect.

### IP and URLs are not allowed

To resolve this issue, follow the guidance in [Skype for Business Online and Microsoft Teams](/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams) to allow (or allowlist) IPs and URLs that are required for Teams portal access.â€‹

### A Skype for Business hybrid connection is not set up for Skype for Business on-premises and Teams interoperability (hybrid configuration only)

For Skype for Business and Teams interoperability, [a Skype for Business hybrid model is required](/microsoftteams/migration-interop-guidance-for-teams-with-skype).

### The result of an ongoing service incident

This error can also be caused by any ongoing service incident. For a list of current incidents, see your [service health dashboard](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/servicehealth).
