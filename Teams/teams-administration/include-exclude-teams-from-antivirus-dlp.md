# How to include or exclude Teams from antivirus or DLP applications

## Summary

Third-party antivirus and data loss prevention (DLP) applications can interfere with the Microsoft Teams app, and it can prevent the application from starting correctly. ITPRO and Security customers can include or approve the Teams app when they use non-Microsoft antivirus or DLP in PC clients. This action specifically helps enhance performance and mitigate the effect on security.

## More information

To prevent any interference of Teams, add the following items to the "exclusion list" process in the Antivirus Software.

- `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\teams.exe`
- `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\update.exe`
- `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Teams\current\squirrel.exe`
- `C:\Users\*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\TeamsMeetingAddin`

Or, you can add the items to the "safe" ("allowlisted") programs list in the DLP application. (The method to accomplish this varies. For specific instructions, contact the application manufacturer.)
