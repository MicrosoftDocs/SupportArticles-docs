# Resolve Teams client launch failures

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article describes a Microsoft Teams feature that was announced but is not yet released. Admins can learn more about the release by checking the Message Center (in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/adminportal/home)). For more information about the feature, see [Teams client health](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=478610) and [Monitor Teams client updates](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?filters=&searchterms=478609).

When a user in your organization tries to start the Teams app on their device, a blank window opens and then disappears immediately. This issue is categorized as a **Launch failure** in the [Teams client health dashboard](/microsoftteams/teams-client-health). 

As an administrator, you can check the **Insight** column on the **Issues** tab to find a potential cause of the launch failure. This article lists all the insights for Teams client launch failures and provides resolutions for them. If the issue persists after you perform the resolution, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus) for more assistance.

## Timed out waiting for Teams endpoint

To fix the issue, review and update your network configuration. Make sure that the Teams client access to [Teams endpoints](/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view=o365-worldwide#microsoft-teams&preserve-view=true) isn't blocked by a firewall or proxy settings, and that all Teams-related network requests are allowed in your environment.

## Teams application contains a script error
