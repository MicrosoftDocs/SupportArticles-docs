# Error when sending messages to a group chat in Teams: Failed to send

In Microsoft Teams, the chat creator receives the following error message if more than 200 members are added concurrently to a group chat:

> Failed to send

:::image type="content" source="./media/unable-send-message-group-chat/teams-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Teams Failed to send error message.":::

This behavior is by design. Although group chats can have up to 250 members, no more than 200 members can be added at the same time.
