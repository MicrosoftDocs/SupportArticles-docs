# Users with Exchange Online mailboxes can't access meetings or connectors 

## Problem

You have actively blocked EWS from services within Exchange Online, but need to have Microsoft Teams compliant within EWS policies and cannot access meetings or connectors.

## Solution

To make Microsoft Teams compliant, add the following user agent strings for Microsoft Teams within the **EWSAllowList**, including asterisks: 

```
SkypeSpaces/* 
```
and 

```
MicrosoftNinja/*
```

The following command can also be used: 

```
Set-organizationconfig -EwsAllowList @{Add="MicrosoftNinja/*","SkypeSpaces/*"}
```
