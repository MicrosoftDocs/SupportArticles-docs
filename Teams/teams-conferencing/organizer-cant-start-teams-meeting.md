# Organizer unable to start Outlook meeting and stuck in virtual lobby

## Symptoms

The organizer of a meeting created in Outlook may find they cannot start the meeting, and may also be unable to proceed from in the Virtual Lobby.

## Cause

This issue might occur if your Outlook client is signed in to an account different than your Teams client.

## Resolution

When you join the meeting, make sure your Outlook client and Teams client are signed in to the same account that the meeting was scheduled from.
