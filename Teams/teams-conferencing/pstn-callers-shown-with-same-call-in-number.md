# PSTN callers with the same "From" number are shown as the same user

## Summary

When multiple Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) callers join a meeting in Teams, and their caller IDs are masked as a single number, they show up as a single caller in the meeting roster rather than as individual callers. 

## More information

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.
