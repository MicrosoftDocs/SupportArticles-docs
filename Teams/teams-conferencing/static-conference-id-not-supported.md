# Static conference ID not supported for Microsoft Teams meetings

## Summary

If the admin overrides the default setting from dynamic conference ID to static conference ID, the setting may not take effect for Microsoft Teams meetings. 

## More information

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.

For more information about dynamic IDs, see [Using Audio Conferencing dynamic IDs in your organization](/skypeforbusiness/audio-conferencing-in-office-365/using-audio-conferencing-dynamic-ids-in-your-organization).
