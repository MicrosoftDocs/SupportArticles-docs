# Dialing out in Teams requires five or more digits 

## Symptoms

Users dialing out from a meeting in Teams are forced to type in five or more digits, even though a dial plan normalization rule is available to normalize short digit dialing to E.164. 

## Workaround
 
Dial out by typing the full DID number or local number format instead of internal extension number.
