# Microsoft Teams Room can’t open PowerPoint presentations after disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in Skype for Business Server 2019 and Skype for Business Server 2015

## Symptoms

When another user shares a PowerPoint presentation, you receive this error message on the Microsoft Teams Room device:

> "We can't connect to the server for sharing right now."

## Cause

Microsoft Teams Room (formerly called Skype Room System v2) devices running versions 4.0.64.0 to 4.3.42.0 (inclusively) still use TLS 1.0 to send a Client Hello to the Front-End Web Conferencing Service. If TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are disabled on the Skype for Business Server 2015 or 2019, the TLS handshake will fail.

## Resolution

Install the March 31, 2020 update for Microsoft Teams Room version 4.4.25.0.
