# Teams is slow during video sharing on laptops docked to 4K/UHD monitors

The overall performance of Microsoft Teams on laptops may be affected during meetings that use video. This issue can occur if a laptop is docked to an external 4K or ultra-high-definition (also known as ultra HD or UHD) display.

## Workarounds

Reduce the resource requirements for your laptop to improve the Teams experience during the meeting by using the following workarounds:

- Close any applications or browser tabs that you aren't using.
- Turn off video in the meeting:
  - To turn off your own video, select **Turn camera off** in the meeting controls.
  - To turn off incoming video, select **More actions** > **Turn off incoming video** in the meeting controls.
- Disable GPU hardware acceleration in Teams. To disable this function, select the **Settings and more** menu next to your profile picture at the top right of Teams, and then select the **Disable GPU hardware acceleration** option.
- Disconnect your monitor from the port replicator or docking station, and directly connect it to the video port on the laptop, if available.
- Restart Teams.
- Change the resolution of your 4K or UHD monitor to 1920 x 1080. For more information, see [Change desktop icon size or screen resolution](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026956).
- Use DVI or HDMI instead USB-C to connect your monitor, if possible.
- Disable full screen mode in the meeting by selecting **More actions** > **Full screen**.
- [Update Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/535a8e4b-45f0-4f6c-8b3d-91bca7a51db1) and [make sure that the latest update is installed](/microsoftteams/troubleshoot-installation#check-whether-teams-is-updated-successfully).
