# Microsoft Teams user cannot send a message in Skype for Business

## Problem

You send a message to a Skype for Business (formerly Lync) user from Microsoft Teams and the message fails. This issue may occur in the following scenarios: 

- Scenario 1: The message's recipient is set to **Offline** or **Do Not Disturb** in Skype for Business.    
- Scenario 2: The sender and recipient aren't both using Microsoft Teams.

## Solution

- Scenario 1: The recipient must be set to an active state, such as **Available**, in order to receive messages.   
- Scenario 2: Microsoft is working to resolve this issue. If your Skype for Business user account is on-premises, the sender and recipient must be using Microsoft Teams to send or receive messages using Microsoft Teams.
