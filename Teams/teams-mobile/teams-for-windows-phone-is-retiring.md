# Windows phone app for Microsoft Teams is retiring

## Summary

The Windows Phone app for Microsoft Teams is scheduled to be retired. After this change takes effect, this app will no longer be available for download from Microsoft Store, and Microsoft will no longer provide support. 
Although Microsoft continues to support Windows 10 Mobile, we are not focused on building new features for the system. We will continue to invest in Microsoft Teams mobile apps for iOS and Android and in desktop apps for Windows and Mac. 

## More Information

### How does this affect me?

Beginning July 20, 2018, the Microsoft Teams app for Windows Phone will no longer be available from the Microsoft Store. Existing users will be able to continue using the app until October 20, 2018. After October 20, the Microsoft Teams app will no longer work, and users will receive an error message when they try to connect.

### What do I have to do to prepare for this change?

If you need to continue using Microsoft Teams on Windows Phone, we recommend that you install the app before July 20, 2018. However, be aware that the app will not work after October 20, 2018.
