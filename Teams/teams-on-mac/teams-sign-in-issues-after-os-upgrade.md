# Can't sign in to Teams for Mac after macOS upgrade

On a device that's running Microsoft Teams for Mac and that has the Company Portal app installed, if you upgrade to macOS version 15.3, you experience issues when you try to sign in to Teams or use Teams features. Additionally, the following banner appears in Teams:

:::image type="content" source="./media/teams-sign-in-issues-after-os-upgrade/restart-banner.png" border="false" alt-text="Screenshot of the banner that recommends device restart.":::

This problem occurs in the following situations:

- You try to sign in to Teams after the upgrade.

- You're already signed in to Teams during the upgrade.

This problem occurs because the [macOS upgrade prevents the Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) extension framework from working correctly for some users](/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin#important-update-on-macos-153-and-ios-1811-impacting-enterprise-sso).
 
To work around the authentication issues, restart your macOS device.
