# Virtual cameras stop working on MacOS Teams desktop client

## Summary

After security fixes are applied in the Teams client for MacOS, virtual camera apps may stop functioning.

## More information

Microsoft is working to re-enable secure support for virtual camera apps on the Mac client. Until an update is released, you can use the virtual camera in Teams in a web browser (such as Edge or Chrome) on your Mac.
