# "Couldn't complete the call" error when you call from a contact card

## Symptoms

In the Microsoft Teams Windows desktop client, you try to call a user in your organization by selecting the **Call** icon:::image type="icon" source="media/error-call-from-contact-card/call-icon.png"::: from their contact card. However, you receive the following error message:

> Couldn't complete the call. With your calling license, you can only call people within your organization. Talk to your IT admin to change your license.

## Cause

This issue occurs because you aren't enabled to use the Enterprise Voice feature. To initiate a call by using a contact card, the caller must be enabled for Enterprise Voice.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods to make the call:

- In a one-to-one chat with the target user, select the **Audio call** icon:::image type="icon" source="media/error-call-from-contact-card/call-icon.png":::.
- Select **Calls** on the vertical toolbar, enter the user's name, select the user from the results list, and then select **Call**.
