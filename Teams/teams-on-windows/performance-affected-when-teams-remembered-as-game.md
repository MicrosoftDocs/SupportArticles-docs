# Teams performance is affected if it's remembered as a game by Xbox Game Bar

The performance of Microsoft Teams is adversely affected if it's remembered by the Microsoft Xbox Game Bar on a computer that currently runs or has ever run Windows 10, version 1809 ([released on November 13, 2018](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history)).

## Cause

This issue occurs because the Xbox Game Bar on Windows 10 is running in the background, and it remembers Teams as a game.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Disable Teams as a game

1. Make Teams the active window on your screen.
2. Press Windows logo key+G to open **Xbox Game Bar**.
3. Go to **Settings** > **General**, and then clear the **Remember this is a game** check box.
4. Go to **Settings** > **Capturing**, and then clear the **Record in the background while I'm playing a game** check box.  

### Method 2: Disable Xbox Game Bar

1. Select **Start** > **Settings** > **Gaming** > **Xbox Game Bar**.
2. Turn off **Xbox Game Bar**.
