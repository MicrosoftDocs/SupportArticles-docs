# "One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 5,000 OneNote items" error when you access a notebook for Microsoft Teams

## Symptoms

You can't access a notebook for Microsoft Teams in Microsoft OneNote. Additionally, you receive the following error message:

**One or more of the document libraries on the user or group's OneDrive contains more than 5,000 OneNote items (notebooks, sections, section groups) and cannot be queried using the API. Please make sure that none of the user or group's document libraries contains more than 5,000 OneNote items. Please follow the link below for instructions on how to remedy this situation.** 

## Cause

This issue occurs if the document libraries contain more than 5,000 OneNote items. This is a known OneNote limitation in Microsoft Teams.

## Status

Microsoft is researching this problem, and will post more information in this article when more information becomes available.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, reduce the number of items in OneNote.

## More Information

We recommend that you access OneNote through OneNote online or the OneNote application and remove items that aren't needed.

To determine the item count, use one of the following methods:

- Use the OneNote API Diagnostic to count the number of items in a certain document library:

- Run Microsoft.Office.OneNote.OneNoteAPIDiagnostics.exe, and then enter the URL, user and password: 

    **https://\<domain>.sharepoint.com/sites/\<site>/**

    Here is an output example:
    
    ```AsciiDoc
    Items Count:14744
    Notebooks Count:0
    Folders Count:4607
    Sections Count:0
    Content Type ID:True
    File Type:True
    HTML File Type:True 
    ```
