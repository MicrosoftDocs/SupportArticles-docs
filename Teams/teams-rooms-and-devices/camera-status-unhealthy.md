# The Camera status is Unhealthy

## Symptoms

In the [Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com/), the **Camera** signal of a Microsoft Teams Rooms device is shown as **Unhealthy**. Users also experience the following issues during a Teams meeting:

- The camera icon on the room console is unavailable.
- The video of in-room participants is unavailable to remote participants.
- The tile that shows a preview of the room's camera isn't presented in the Front of Room display.

Additionally, Event ID 3001 is logged under **Applications and Services Logs** > **Skype Room System** in **Event Viewer**. The entry resembles the following entry:

> {"Description":"Conference Microphone status : Healthy. Conference Speaker status : Healthy. Default Speaker status : Healthy. **Camera status : Unhealthy.** Front of Room Display status : Healthy. Motion Sensor status : Healthy. HDMI Ingest status : Healthy. Content Camera status : Healthy. ","ResourceState":"Unhealthy","OperationName":"HardwareCheckEngine","OperationResult":"Fail","OS":"Windows 10","OSVersion":"10.0.19044.1889","Alias":"lab@contoso.com ","DisplayName":"Lenovo Hub 500 - Rally Plus - 2FoR","AppVersion":"4.13.132.0","IPv4Address":"1.2.3.4","IPv6Address":""}

> [!NOTE]
> The **Camera** signal reports the status of the default video camera that's configured in Teams Rooms app settings. The report doesn't include the status of the [content camera](/microsoftteams/rooms/content-camera).

## Resolution

Camera issues can occur for different reasons. To fix common issues that affect the camera, try the following options.

### Make sure the camera is powered on and connected

- Verify that the camera and the Teams Rooms device are securely connected.
- If the camera requires an external power supply, make sure that the power supply is connected.

### Check the camera configuration

Check whether the camera is mistakenly configured as a content camera. A content camera is used to stream a traditional whiteboard into meetings. In this case, set content camera to none in Teams Rooms app settings.

### Check whether the default camera instance is changed

The Teams Rooms app tracks the default camera by using a specific camera instance ID. This is a combination of a specific camera (according to a serial number) and a specific USB port. The instance ID will change in either of the following situations:

- You replace the camera with another camera, even with the same brand and model.
- You change the connection from one USB port to another.

In this case, select the new camera instance as the default camera in Teams Rooms app setting.

> [!NOTE]
> In Teams Rooms app version 4.13.*, the default camera is automatically set in the following scenario:
>
> - The default camera isn't configured.
> - An administrator opens **Settings** > **Peripherals**, configures any settings other than the default camera, saves the settings, and then exits.
>
> In this scenario, the first available camera is automatically selected as the default video camera.

### If you use an all-in-one video bar, reset the bar

All-in-one video bars use only one USB cable to connect to the Teams Rooms device. In this case, reset the power of the device. Some bars may have a reset button to reset the devices.

If the issue persists, contact your peripheral manufacturer to troubleshoot any hardware or firmware issues.

### Check firmware issues

Try the following options:

- If the peripheral device was recently updated, the firmware update might not be completed. In this situation, the device is in an unusable state. Try to reset the power of the device. Some devices may have a reset button to reset the devices.
- Verify with your peripheral manufacturer that the device is running the latest firmware version. Or, work with the manufacturer to fix any known issues.

### Check for issues in USB extenders

If possible, avoid using USB extenders for audio and video equipment. If you must use a USB extender, use one that's supported by the peripheral device and meets the requirements, such as length and USB specification. For more information, contact your peripheral manufacturer.
