# The Disk Space status is unhealthy

## Symptoms

In the [Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com/), the **Disk Space** signal of a Microsoft Teams Rooms (MTR) device is **Unhealthy**.

Depending on the amount of disk space available, you may experience slowness, inability to download files, update failure, freezes, and more. Typically, the amount of available disk space is exhausted after installing a Windows feature update.

This signal is flagged as unhealthy when the free disk space on the system drive (usually C:) has dropped below 18% and is less than 15 GB.

## Remediation executed by MTR Pro

When low disk space is reported, MTR Pro performs a remediation to free up folder space that's known to grow and isn't critical to MTR functionality. Remediation is triggered after hours to prevent any disruption to active meetings. The following actions are taken:

- Temporary, cache, download, and old log files are deleted from all user folders.
- Backups of the *SoftwareDistribution* folder created by Windows Update repairs are removed.
- If the device is out of the defined Windows version rollback period, the *C:\ESD* folder is deleted.
- All application directories except the last two MTR Pro agents' previous version application directories are deleted.
- TMP files older than 10 days generated by the MTR app desktop API service are deleted.
- All users recycle bins are emptied.
- Hibernation is disabled.
- Page file management is set to system management.
- If any event log is larger than 20 MB, the maximum event log size is set to 20 MB.
- If any event log is larger than 100 MB and the amount of free space is less than 10%, the event log is cleared.
- If the amount of free disk space is greater than 5% and the [WinSxS folder](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/manage-the-component-store) is less than 25 GB, the built-in `StartComponentCleanup` task is executed. Or `DISM /StartComponentCleanup` is executed to reduce the size of the WinSxS folder.
- If Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) snapshots consume more than 5% of the total disk space, shadow storage is set to a maximum of 5%.
- Disk Cleanup is used to remove unnecessary files.

> [!NOTE]
> Remediation automation waits up to five minutes until Windows Disk Cleanup completes all tasks. The task may free up a lot of disk space after the remediation has completed and posted results back to the portal.

## Remediation result

You'll see one of the following results after remediation is completed:

- Remediated

  When the remediation is considered successful, the device will have more headroom than the trigger thresholds and will report the overall results back to the portal. The results will state the previous total disk space and the new total disk space. The **Disk Space** signal will be flagged as **Healthy** shortly after remediation result is available.
- Additional action required

  If the remediation doesn't free enough space to relieve the thresholds, another task is run to collect a recursive list of folder sizes. The largest folders are posted back to the portal in a list, so that you can take further actions to free up enough space to fix the issue and flag the signal as healthy.
