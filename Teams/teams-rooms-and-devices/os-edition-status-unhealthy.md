# The OS Edition status is Unhealthy

## Symptoms

In the [Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro Management portal](https://portal.rooms.microsoft.com/), the **OS Edition** signal of a Microsoft Teams Rooms device is shown as **Unhealthy**, and the incident severity is shown as **Critical**.

Users also experience the following issues on the device:

- The device doesn't sign in automatically.
- The device console displays a black or gray screen.

## Cause

These issues occur when the Teams Rooms Pro agent detects that the device isn't running a supported edition of Windows 10. Teams Rooms devices require the Windows 10 IoT Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise SKUs under Semi-Annual Channel servicing options. For more information, see [Windows 10 release support](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-lifecycle-support#windows-10-release-support).

## Resolution

- Make sure that you're using a supported Teams Rooms system listed in [Microsoft Teams Rooms requirements](/microsoftteams/rooms/requirements). Otherwise, replace it with a supported system. All current Teams Rooms devices and bundles are available in the [Teams Rooms product showcase](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/across-devices/devices/category/teams-rooms/20).
- Reimage the device as described in the OEM documentation.

## More information

All certified Teams Rooms devices are pre-installed together with an IoT Enterprise or the binary-equivalent Enterprise edition of Windows 10. You can also choose to upgrade an existing IoT Enterprise edition to the full Enterprise edition using Bring Your Own License (BYOL).
