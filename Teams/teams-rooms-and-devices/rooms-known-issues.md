## Teams Rooms on Windows

### Software issues

| Issue  |  Description | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Low meeting volume after content sharing|Teams Rooms devices on Windows 10 20H2 experience decreased media and meeting volume after you share content through in-room HDMI. This issue is due to an audio condition in Windows 10 20H2.|To fix this issue, upgrade to version [4.9.12.0](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-release-note#49120-7282021) of the Teams Rooms app.|
|Teams Rooms app out of date|The Teams Rooms console displays the **system config out of date** error.|To fix this issue, [use the Microsoft Teams Rooms recovery tool](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/recovery-tool).|
|Windows version on device updated to unsupported version for Teams Rooms|A Windows 10 device is updated from version 1803 to version 1809. Version 1809 isn't supported for Teams Rooms.|This issue can occur if the [Group Policy or MDM setting for the DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodinDays parameter](/windows/deployment/update/waas-configure-wufb#configure-when-devices-receive-feature-updates) is set to 365 days, which is the maximum value. As of March 27, 2020, version 1809 is more than 365 days old. Therefore, the Windows 10 device that's running version 1803 installs version 1809 after 365 days of running version 1803. However, version 1809 isn't supported for Teams Rooms and might cause issues that affect Teams Rooms adversely.<br/><br/>To avoid this situation, remove the configuration from any Group Policy or MDM setting that's set up to defer updates. It's important to not configure the policy or setting  and not set to 0. Then the device will always update to the latest version of Windows that supports Teams Rooms.|
|Virtual keyboard missing|The virtual keyboard doesn't appear when you have to enter information in Teams Rooms devices. This issue occurs in Windows 10, version 1903.|Install the April 2020 Cumulative Update for Windows 10, version 1903 for x64-based systems through Windows Update.|
|Teams Rooms app fails to start after update|If your Teams Rooms device uses a processor (CPU) which supports Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET), such as the 11th Gen Intel&reg; Core&trade; Processor or later and you have:<ul><li>Applied cumulative update KB5013942</li><li>Not applied cumulative update KB5015020 or later</li><li>Updated the Teams Rooms app</li></ul>then you might see an error that the Teams Rooms app can't be started.|Reimage the Teams Rooms device with OEM media that uses Windows operating system version 20H2 or later.|
|Can't access Windows Settings from the desktop right-click menu.|On Teams Rooms devices that are running app version 3.1.98.0 or later versions, any user account that has the Teams Rooms app installed can access Windows Settings only by using the Start menu. If you try to access Windows Settings by using another method, the Teams Rooms app will open instead.|Use one of the following workarounds to access Windows Settings:<ul><li>Select the **Settings** option from the **Start** menu.</li><li>Uninstall the Teams Rooms app for the affected user. Locate the app on the **Start** menu, right-click it and select **Uninstall**.</li></ul>|
|Teams Rooms device loses internet connectivity after installing a feature update for Windows| A Teams Rooms device that is connected to a network which requires a proxy can't connect to the internet after installing a feature update for Windows, including an upgrade to Windows 11.<br/><br/>This issue occurs if the proxy setting for internet access on the affected device is configured for the LocalSystem instead of a system-wide proxy. The Windows feature update deletes the LocalSystem settings. This behavior is by design.|If your device has proxy settings set for the LocalSystem user, transfer those settings to the [system-wide proxy settings](/windows/client-management/mdm/networkproxy-csp) that are set and maintained through Mobile Device Management (MDM). Alternatively, you can use the [Set-WinInetProxy](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WinInetProxy/0.1.0) PowerShell cmdlet to configure the system-wide proxy settings.</br></br>When you use system-wide proxy settings, they won't be affected when you install Windows feature updates on the device in future.|
|Teams Rooms calendar doesn't display meeting organizer's name when meeting name is hidden|In the new home screen experience in Teams Rooms on Windows, if the option to hide meeting names is enabled in **Settings**, the Teams Rooms calendar displays "Hidden meeting name" as the meeting title instead of the name of the meeting organizer.|No workaround is available at this time.|
|Test service plans display in Teams Rooms Pro and Teams Rooms Basic licenses|IT Admins who assign user licenses in the Microsoft Teams admin center or in Azure Active Directory see the following test service plans in Teams Rooms Pro and Teams Rooms Basic licenses:<ul><li>Teams Rooms Test 1</li><li>Teams Rooms Test 2</li></ul> | No workaround is required. These service plans don't have any capabilities and can be ignored. They'll continue to display for the lifetime of the two SKUs.|
|Front-of-room display shows a black screen intermittently|On devices that are running version 4.17.x.x of the Teams Rooms for Windows app, you might see a black screen intermittently in the front-of-room display after the system has been idle for some time. </br></br>Both the Microsoft Teams admin center & the Pro Management portal will indicate that the front-of-room display is functioning normally. This is because the display isn't disconnected. Instead, the app window is hidden.|Select either the **Meet now** or the **Call** button on the console of the Teams Rooms device to restore the front-of-room display immediately.</br></br>To fix the issue, upgrade the Teams Rooms app to version 4.18.35.0.|
|Teams Rooms device console display shows only a **Refresh** button.| On devices that are running version 4.17.x.x of the Teams Rooms for Windows app, you might see a black screen with a **Refresh** button on the console intermittently after the system has been idle for some time.|Select the **Refresh** button to restore the console display. </br></br> If you see the black screen both in the front-of-room display and on the console, select the **Refresh** button on the console display to restore both affected displays.|
|Error displays in Teams Rooms device console|On devices that are running version 4.17.51.0 or later of the Teams Rooms app, the console displays the following error: Teams is currently experiencing an error. If the problem persists, please try restarting your device or talk to your administrator.</i> </br></br>The error displays after actions such as the following occur:<ul><li>The account credentials to sign in to the device are changed.</li><li>The Teams cache is cleared.</li><li>Updates are installed by Teams in the background.</li></ul>|In most cases, this error display goes away after a few minutes and the Teams Rooms app starts normally. No user action is needed. </br></br>If the error display persists beyond a few minutes, then restart the device.|
|Text and icons turn dark on a device that's running Teams Rooms on Windows|After the Teams Rooms app is updated from version 4.16 to 4.17 on devices that're running Teams Rooms on Windows, the text and icons in the device display become dark and unreadable in the new home screen experience.|Use the following steps:<ol><li>Access the Admin mode on the device.</li><li>Navigate to C:\Users\Skype\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.SkypeRoomSystem_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\Roaming\Microsoft\Teams</li><li>Open the desktop-config.json file.</li><li>Either update or add the **theme** property with <i>contrast</i> as its value as shown in the following example:</br>"theme" : "contrast".</li><li>Restart the Teams Rooms device.</li><li>Select **Accessibility** on the device console, and turn off the **High contrast** option.</li><li>Restart the Teams Rooms device and check whether the text and icons are readable.</li><li>If the issue still persists, update the value of the **theme** property to <i>darkV2</i>.</li><li>Restart the Teams Rooms device and verify that the issue is fixed.</li></ol>|
|Resolution and scaling settings are not applied as specified|If you're using an XML configuration file to apply scaling and resolution settings to Front of Room displays, the settings aren't applied correctly anymore after you update the Teams Rooms app to version 4.18.35. Instead, they are overridden by the Windows display default settings for scaling and resolution.|To work around the issue, re-apply the resolution and scaling settings manually by using Teams Rooms admin settings. See [Front of Room display settings](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-operations#front-of-room-display-settings?view=exchange-ps&preserve-view=true) for more information.|  
|Video of remote participants has low resolution in SIP/H323 calls|In SIP/H323 calls on a Teams Rooms device that is running either version 4.18.35 or 4.18.43 of the Teams Rooms app, the remote participant's video is set to a default resolution of 360p.|No workaround is available at this time.|

### Hardware issues

| Issue  |  Description | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
|Monitors not detected|When you run Teams Rooms on a Surface Pro (Model 2017) device, monitors aren't detected.|Hold down the power button of the Surface Pro device for 20 seconds or more to restart it. A restart will clear the graphics cache.|
|During a Coordinated meeting, when the meeting volume is changed by using a room remote, the speaker on a Surface Hub or Teams Rooms device turns on.|For a trusted device such as a Surface Hub or Teams Rooms device that is set up to auto-join a Coordinated meeting when the primary device joins, the speaker turns on when the meeting volume is changed by using a room remote. This issue occurs even though the audio settings on the device are turned off, and whether they're enabled or disabled.|Turn off proximity join and room remote capabilities on the trusted devices that auto-join a Coordinated meeting.|

| Volume of the audio received from Poly Studio X30 or X50 devices is low. | In a Teams meeting that uses either the Poly Studio X30 or Poly Studio X50 Teams Rooms device, the audio that is sent to remote participants might have low volume. <br/><br/>This issue occurs because of a change made to Teams audio processing which causes the audio level of the microphone on the device to be set very low. | Log into the web interface for the affected Poly Studio X30 or X50 device using administrator credentials and use the following steps:<ol><li>Select **Audio / Video** > **Audio**.</li><li>Select the drop-down arrow in the **Transmission Audio Gain (dB)** field.</li><li>Select a number between 14 & 18 to specify the decibels for the audio sent from the microphone.</li></ol>

## Limitations

- Front row requires 1920 × 1080 resolution for a 16:9 display or 2560 × 1080 resolution for a 21:9 display. These displays are set to 100 percent scaling. If the chat panel on your front-of-room display shows unreadable UI, see [Change scale and resolution for front-of-room](/microsoftteams/rooms/rooms-operations#scale-and-resolution) to adjust your display settings.
- Teams Rooms doesn't support High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) input. Using HDCP input may cause issues that affect High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ingest functionality, such as video and audio. To avoid these issues, make sure that the HDCP options are turned off for switches that are connected to Teams Rooms.
- Teams Rooms on Android doesn't support the ability to join cross-cloud meetings.

## Expected behavior

- If your Teams Rooms device loses trust with the domain, you won't be able to authenticate into the device and access its settings. For example, if you remove Teams Rooms from the domain after it gets domain joined, the trust relationship will be lost. In this situation, sign in to the device by using a local administrator account.
- A consumer TV that's used as the front-of-room display might cause stability issues with Teams Rooms for the following reasons:
  - Inconsistent implementation of standby modes
  - Active video source selection
  - Incorrect EDID information that's communicated to the Teams Rooms device

  Known symptoms include a black or gray screen on the front-of-room display, or the Teams Rooms console becomes unresponsive after waking from standby mode. If you experience issues when you use consumer TVs, we recommend that you install a configurable EDID controller or EDID emulator, such as the [HD-RX-4K-201-C-E](https://www.crestron.com/Products/Video/HDMI-Solutions/HDMI-Extenders/HD-RX-4K-210-C-E) from Crestron, or [DR-EDID Emulator](https://fsrinc.com/fsr-products/product/4051-dr-edid2-emulator) from FSR Video Products Group.
- Teams Admin Center only identifies valid certified firmware. If uncertified firmware is updated on the device by means other than the Teams Admin Center, the Admin Center will provide only the old firmware. This issue may occur with Teams Rooms on Android devices and Teams IP phones.
