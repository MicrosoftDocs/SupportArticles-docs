# Signed out of Teams on Android devices

Some Microsoft Teams devices in your environment are signed out of Teams automatically. The devices that are affected by this issue are:

- Teams Rooms on Android
- Teams phone devices
- Teams panels
- Teams displays

If you're a tenant administrator, you can get information about the sign-in state of your devices from the [sign-in logs in the Azure Active Directory portal](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins). To access these logs, navigate to the Azure Active Directory menu > **Monitoring** > **Sign-in logs**.

You can also use the information in the sign-in logs to determine whether a device in your environment is affected by this issue. In the **User sign-ins (non-interactive)** tab, check for the following entries:

In the **Application** column: Microsoft Authentication Broker
In the **Status** column: Failure
In the **Resource** column: Device Registration Service

These entries indicate that your device is affected by the issue.

To sign in to Teams on an affected device, use one of the following options.

## Option 1: Sign in from the Microsoft Teams admin center

**Note** You must have Teams administrator permissions to use this option. Also ensure that your device is running the following versions of the Teams app or a newer version before you begin:

- Teams phone devices: 1449/1.0.94.2021101205
- Teams panels: 1449/1.0.97.2021070601
- Teams displays: 1449/1.0.95.2021111203
