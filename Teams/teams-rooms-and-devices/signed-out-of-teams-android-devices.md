# Certified Android devices get signed out of Teams

Some certified Android devices in your environment are signed out of Microsoft Teams automatically. This issue affects the following devices:

- Teams Rooms on Android
- Teams panels
- Teams phones
- Teams displays

If you're a tenant administrator, you can get information about the sign-in state of your devices from the [sign-in logs in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins). To access these logs, navigate to the Microsoft Entra ID menu, and then select **Monitoring & health** > **Sign-in logs**.

You can also use the information in the sign-in logs to determine whether this issue is affecting a device in your environment. On the **User sign-ins (non-interactive)** tab, check for the following entries:

- In the **Application** column: **Microsoft Authentication Broker**
- In the **Status** column: **Failure**
- In the **Resource** column: **Device Registration Service**

These entries indicate that the issue is affecting your device.

To resolve the Teams sign-in issue on an affected device, select the appropriate option based on the device type.

## Teams Rooms on Android devices and Teams panels

If Teams Rooms on Android devices and Teams panels are affected, run the [Microsoft Teams Rooms Sign in](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsMTRDeviceSignIn/input) connectivity test in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool. This tool is used to troubleshoot connectivity issues that affect Teams. The connectivity test performs checks to verify a specific user's permissions to use a Teams Rooms device to sign in to Teams.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A Global Administrator account is required to run the Microsoft Teams Rooms sign-in connectivity test.
> - The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool isn't available for the GCC and GCC High Microsoft 365 Government environments.

To run the connectivity test, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Microsoft Teams Rooms Sign in](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsMTRDeviceSignIn/input) connectivity test.
1. Sign in by using the credentials of a Global Administrator account.
1. Specify the username for the account that can't access the Teams Rooms app.
1. In the **Device Selection** field, select a type for the affected user's device.
1. Enter the verification code that's displayed, and then select **Verify**.
1. Select the checkbox to accept the terms of agreement, and then select **Perform Test**.

After the test finishes, the screen displays details about all the checks that were performed and whether the test succeeded, failed, or was successful but includes warnings. In the list of failures or warnings, select the provided links for more information about each item and how to resolve it.

## Teams phones

If Teams phones are affected, run the [Teams Android Desk Phone Sign in](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsPhoneDeviceSignIn/input) connectivity test in the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool. This tool is used to troubleshoot connectivity issues that affect Teams. The connectivity test verifies that the user account meets the requirements for a Teams user to sign in to a Teams Android desk phone. For more information about all the checks that this test performs, see [Teams Android Desk Phone Diagnostic](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-support/new-diagnostic-updated-teams-android-desk-phone-diagnostic-now/ba-p/3957808).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Both administrators and non-administrators can run the Teams Android Desk Phone Sign in connectivity test.
> - The Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer tool isn't available for the GCC and GCC High Microsoft 365 Government environments.

To run the connectivity test, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to the [Teams Android Desk Phone Sign in](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/TeamsPhoneDeviceSignIn/input) connectivity test.
1. Sign in by using the credentials of the affected user account. To perform advanced tests, sign in by using the credentials of a Global Administrator account, and then specify the affected user account in the **Specify the target user name (optional)** field.
1. Enter the verification code that's displayed, and then select **Verify**.
1. Select the checkbox to accept the terms of agreement, and then select **Perform Test**.

After the test finishes, the screen displays details about all the checks that were performed and whether the test succeeded, failed, or was successful but includes warnings. In the list of failures or warnings, select the provided links for more information about each item and how to resolve it.
