1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Devices** in the navigation menu on the left side, and then select your Android device.
3. On the page for the Android device, select **Restart** to restart the device.

## Workaround 4: If you still can't sign in to the device, reset the device to its factory settings

1. Perform a factory reset from the OEM device settings or by using the key combination that's specific to the OEM model.
2. Use workaround 1, 2 or 3 to sign in to the device.
