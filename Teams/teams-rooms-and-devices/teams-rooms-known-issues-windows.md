|Teams Rooms device loses internet connectivity after installing a feature update for Windows| A Teams Rooms device that is connected to a network, which requires a proxy can't connect to the internet after installing a feature update for Windows, including an upgrade to Windows 11.<br/><br/>This issue occurs if the proxy setting for internet access on the affected device is configured for the LocalSystem instead of a system-wide proxy. The Windows feature update deletes the LocalSystem settings. This behavior is by design.|If your device has proxy settings set for the LocalSystem user, transfer those settings to the [system-wide proxy settings](/windows/client-management/mdm/networkproxy-csp) that are set and maintained through Mobile Device Management (MDM). Alternatively, you can use the [Set-WinInetProxy](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/WinInetProxy/0.1.0) PowerShell cmdlet to configure the system-wide proxy settings.</br></br>When you use system-wide proxy settings, they won't be affected when you install Windows feature updates on the device in future.|

|Xbox application window appears on a Teams Rooms device.|In a Teams Rooms on Windows device, when you select **Room Controls** on the console, an Xbox app window appears.

|Volume change indicator not working|When you change the volume of a Teams Rooms device by using the volume controls that are on the device or on an external audio device, the change isn't displayed in the volume setting of the Teams Rooms device.<br/><br/>The change to the volume settings takes effect but the visual display doesn't reflect the change.|No workaround is required because the functionality is working.|
|Teams Rooms app window doesn't fill the screen on the device console.|The window of the Teams Rooms app takes up only a part of the device console or Front of Room display and doesn't resize to fill the screen.<br/><br/>This issue usually occurs in displays that are disconnected in their Sleep or Wake states.|To fix the issue, update to version 5.1.24.0 of the Teams Rooms app.|
|Chat panel in Gallery view is blank.|You restart a Teams Rooms on Windows device and join a meeting. However you see that the chat panel in Gallery view is empty.<br/><br/>This issue occurs only with the first meeting that you join after restarting your device.

|The onscreen keyboard on a touch console device is missing or not responsive.|The onscreen keyboard on the touch console in a Teams Rooms for Windows device either doesn't work or doesn't appear.<br/><br/>Because of this issue, you're unable to perform the following actions:<ul><li>Enter text to call another user.</li><li>Add a user to a meeting.</li><li>Enter a username and password to access the Settings menu.</li></ul>|To fix the issue, update to version 5.2.115.0 of the Teams Rooms app.|

## Hardware issues

| Issue  |  Description | Workaround |
| --- | --- | --- |
|During a Coordinated meeting, when the meeting volume is changed by using a room remote, the speaker on a Surface Hub or Teams Rooms device turns on.|For a trusted device such as a Surface Hub or Teams Rooms device that is set up to automatically join a Coordinated meeting when the primary device joins, the speaker turns on when a room remote is used to change the meeting volume. This issue occurs even though the audio settings on the device are turned off, and whether they're enabled or disabled.|Turn off proximity join and room remote capabilities on the trusted devices that automatically join a Coordinated meeting.|

## Limitations

- Teams Rooms doesn't support High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) input. Using HDCP input might cause issues that affect High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ingest functionality, such as video and audio. To avoid these issues, make sure that the HDCP options are turned off for switches that are connected to Teams Rooms.
- When you use the Call app on a Teams Rooms device to dial the toll number or conference ID for a Teams meeting, the conference bridge triggers multiple call flows. Because the Teams Rooms app is designed to support only one active call at a time, the call fails.

  Instead of using the Call app, join the meeting by using the **Join with an ID** option and entering the meeting ID.
- If you're in a call with another user who is on a Teams Rooms device, you can't transfer the call. This is because the Teams Rooms app is designed to support only one call at a time.
