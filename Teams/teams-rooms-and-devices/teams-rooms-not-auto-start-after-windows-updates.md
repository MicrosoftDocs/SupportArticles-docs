# Teams Rooms app doesn't start automatically after installing Windows updates

## Symptoms

The Microsoft Teams Rooms app doesn't start automatically after a Teams Rooms device that's running Windows installs Windows updates and restarts.

## Cause

The issue occurs because Windows Update installs an unsupported version of Windows on the device.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. [Switch to admin mode](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-operations#admin-mode-and-device-management), start an elevated command prompt, and then run the following command to collect logs:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted c:\rigel\x64\scripts\provisioning\ScriptLaunch.ps1 CollectSrsV2Logs.ps1
   ```

1. Locate the .zip log file in *C:\rigel* that might be named similar to *SRSv2-\<Device Name\>-\<DateTime\>.zip*.
1. Open the .zip file, locate and open the *MSInfo32.txt* file.
1. Compare the values of **OS Name** and **Version** with the [versions of Windows 10 that support Teams Rooms](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-lifecycle-support#windows-10-release-support) to confirm that an unsupported version of Windows is installed.
1. Use the [Microsoft Teams Rooms recovery tool](/microsoftteams/rooms/recovery-tool) to restore the device to a supported state. You can use the recovery tool only on [supported devices](/microsoftteams/rooms/requirements#hardware-requirements).

   > [!NOTE]
   > If any update policies are still applied to the device after you run the recovery tool, the issue might recur when the device restarts unexpectedly because the update policies force the device to reinstall the problematic update. To prevent this, it's important to review and modify the update policies after the recovery process. For more information about how to manage Windows updates for Teams Rooms devices by using [Group Policy](/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-install-software), [Intune](/mem/intune/protect/windows-update-for-business-configure#windows-10-feature-updates), or [Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/osd/deploy-use/manage-windows-as-a-service), see [Manage Windows Updates](/microsoftteams/rooms/updates) and [Windows 10 release support](/MicrosoftTeams/rooms/rooms-lifecycle-support#windows-10-release-support). Alternatively, consider excluding these devices from your Windows Update management.
