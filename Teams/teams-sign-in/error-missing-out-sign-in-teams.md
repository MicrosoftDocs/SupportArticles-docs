# "You're missing out!" error when signing in to Teams

## Symptoms

When users try to sign in to Microsoft Teams, they receive the following error message:

> "You're missing out! Ask your admin to enable Microsoft Teams for \<CompanyName\>"

## Resolution

In Microsoft 365 Education tenants, Microsoft Teams isn't enabled by default. You must turn it on. Learn how to [enable Microsoft Teams for your school](/microsoft-365/education/deploy/enable-microsoft-teams).

If your organization is eligible for the Microsoft Teams Exploratory experience, make sure that users can run the Teams Exploratory experience. For more information, see [Manage the Teams Exploratory experience](/microsoftteams/teams-exploratory#manage-the-teams-exploratory-experience).
