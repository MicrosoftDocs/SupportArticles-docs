# Teams web client is stuck in a login loop

When you try to sign in to Microsoft Teams in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer, the site continually loops, and you're not able to sign in.

This issue occurs if you use the **Trusted Sites** feature in your browser and you don't add the URLs for Microsoft Teams to the list of sites that your browser should trust. In this situation, the Teams web client can't sign in.

To resolve this issue, update the settings for your browser. You must have administrative rights to make the updates. If you're the administrator for your organization, you can use a Group Policy Object (GPO) to make the updates.

Locate your browser among the following sections, and follow the provided steps.

## Microsoft Edge

1. In the Edge **Settings** window, select **Cookies and site permissions** > **Cookies and data stored** > **Manage and delete cookies and site data**.
2. Turn on **Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)**, and make sure that **Block third-party cookies** is turned off. 

   Or, iIf you have to keep third-party cookies blocked, do this instead in the same window:

   Under **Allow**, select **Add** to add the following sites:

    - [*.]microsoft.com
    - [*.]microsoftonline.com
    - [*.]teams.skype.com
    - [*.]teams.microsoft.com
    - [*.]sfbassets.com
    - [*.]skypeforbusiness.com

To change the settings by using  a GPO, follow these steps:

1. [Download and install the Microsoft Edge administrative template](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#1-download-and-install-the-microsoft-edge-administrative-template).
2. Add the sites that are listed in step 2 under "Microsoft Edge" to **Content settings** > **CookiesAllowedForUrls** by having either a mandatory or recommended policy. For more information, see [Set mandatory or recommended policies](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#2-set-mandatory-or-recommended-policies) and [CookiesAllowedForUrls setting](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cookiesallowedforurls).

## Google Chrome

    - [*.]teams.skype.com
