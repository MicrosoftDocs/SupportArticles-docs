# Microsoft Teams is stuck in a login loop in Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome

## Symptoms

When you try to sign in to Microsoft Teams in Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari, the site continually loops, and you can never signÂ in.

## Cause

This issue occurs if your organization uses **Trusted Sites** in Internet Explorer and doesn't enable the URLs for Microsoft Teams. In this case, the Teams web-based application cannot sign in, as the trusted sites for Teams aren't enabled.

## Resolution

Change Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari settings using administrator rights or a Group Policy object (GPO).

### Microsoft Edge

1. In the Edge **Settings** window, select **Cookies and site permissions** then select **Manage and delete cookies and site data** under **Cookies and data stored**.
2. Turn on **Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)** and make sure **Block third-party cookies** is turned off. Alternatively, follow step 3 if you need to keep third-party cookies blocked.
3. In the same window, under **Allow**, select **Add** to add the following sites:

    - [*.]microsoft.com
    - [*.]microsoftonline.com
    - [*.]teams.skype.com
    - [*.]teams.microsoft.com
    - [*.]sfbassets.com
    - [*.]skypeforbusiness.com

To change the settings by using GPO, follow these steps:

1. [Download and install the Microsoft Edge administrative template](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#1-download-and-install-the-microsoft-edge-administrative-template).
2. Add the sites listed in step 3 above to the **Content settings** > **CookiesAllowedForUrls** setting, either with a mandatory or recommended policy. For more information, see [Set mandatory or recommended policies](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#2-set-mandatory-or-recommended-policies) and [CookiesAllowedForUrls setting](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cookiesallowedforurls).

### Internet Explorer

> [!Note]
> Starting on November 30, 2020, the Microsoft Teams web app no longer supports Internet Explorer 11. For more information, go [here](https://aka.ms/AA97tsw).

1. In Windows Control Panel, open **Internet Options**.
2. In the Internet Options window, select **Privacy** and **Advanced**.
3. Select **Accept** for **First-party Cookies** and **Third-party Cookies**, and then select the **Always allow session cookies** check box.
