# Microsoft Teams is stuck in a login loop in Edge, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome

## Symptoms

When you try to sign in to Microsoft Teams in Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, the site continually loops, and you can never signÂ in.

## Cause

This issue occurs if your organization uses **Trusted Sites** in Internet Explorer and doesn't enable the URLs for Microsoft Teams. In this case, the Teams web-based application cannot sign in, as the trusted sites for Teams are not enabled.

## Resolution

Change Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome settings using administrator rights or a Group Policy object (GPO).

### Microsoft Edge

1. In the Edge **Settings** window, select **Cookies and site permissions** then select **Manage and delete cookies and site data** under **Cookies and data stored**.
2. Turn on **Allow sites to save and read cookie data (recommended)** and make sure **Block third-party cookies** is turned off. Alternatively, follow step 3 if you need to keep third-party cookies blocked.
3. In the same window, under **Allow**, select **Add** to add the following sites:

    - [*.]microsoft.com
    - [*.]microsoftonline.com
    - [*.]teams.skype.com
    - [*.]teams.microsoft.com
    - [*.]sfbassets.com
    - [*.]skypeforbusiness.com

    :::image type="content" source="media/sign-in-loop/edge.png" alt-text="Screenshot of edge.":::

To change the settings using Group Policy object (GPO):

1. [Download and install the Microsoft Edge administrative template](deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#1-download-and-install-the-microsoft-edge-administrative-template).
2. Add the sites listed in step 3 above to the **Content settings** > **CookiesAllowedForUrls** setting, either with a mandatory or recommended policy. For more information, see [Set mandatory or recommended policies](/deployedge/configure-microsoft-edge#2-set-mandatory-or-recommended-policies) and [CookiesAllowedForUrls setting](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-policies#cookiesallowedforurls).

### Internet Explorer

> [!Note]
> Microsoft 365 apps and services will not support Internet Explorer 11 starting August 17, 2021 (Microsoft Teams will not support Internet Explorer 11 earlier, starting  November 30, 2020). [Learn more](https://aka.ms/AA97tsw). Please note that Internet Explorer 11 will remain a supported browser. Internet Explorer 11 is a component of the Windows operating system and [follows the Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/faq/internet-explorer-microsoft-edge) for the product on which it is  installed.

1. In Windows Control Panel, open **Internet Options**.
2. In the Internet Options window, select **Privacy** and **Advanced**.
3. Select **Accept** for **First-party Cookies** and **Third-party Cookies**, and select the **Always allow session cookies** check box.

    Alternatively, follow steps 3 and 4 if you need to keep third-party cookies blocked.
4. In the Internet Options window, select **Security** > **Trusted Sites** > **Sites**.
5. Add the following sites:

    - `https://*.microsoft.com`
    - `https://*.microsoftonline.com`
    - `https://*.teams.skype.com`
    - `https://*.teams.microsoft.com`
    - `https://*.sfbassets.com`
    - `https://*.skypeforbusiness.com`

### Google Chrome

1. In the Chrome **Settings** window, on the **Privacy and security** tab, select **Cookies and other site data**.
2. Under **Sites that can always use cookies**, select **Add** and select the **Including third-party cookies on this site** check box.
3. Add the following sites:

    - [*.]microsoft.com
    - [*.]microsoftonline.com
    - [*.]teams.skype.com
    - [*.]teams.microsoft.com
    - [*.]sfbassets.com
    - [*.]skypeforbusiness.com

To change the settings using Group Policy object (GPO):

1. [Download and install the Chrome administrative template](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202/set-chrome-browser-policies-on-managed-pcs).
2. Add the sites listed in step 3 above to the **Content settings** > **CookiesAllowedForUrls** setting.

> [!NOTE]
> It's always good to validate and enable all trusted URLs for Teams and review the requirements in the following articles:
>
> - [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](/office365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges#bkmk_teams)
> - [Office 365 U.S. Government GCC High endpoints](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-u-s-government-gcc-high-endpoints?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true)
