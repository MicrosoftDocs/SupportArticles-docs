# "Someone has already set up Teams for your organization" error in Microsoft Teams

## Symptoms

When you try to set up a Microsoft Teams account, you receive the following error message:

> Someone has already set up Teams for your organization

## Resolution

This issue may have several causes.

### Cause 1: Someone has already set up Teams for you

**Resolution:**

- Look for a recent invitation in your email Inbox.
- Alternatively, open [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) from a private or incognito browser window. Then, enter your domain credentials to sign in.

### Cause 2: Your email address is tied to both a work and a personal account

For example, you're using the `contoso.com` domain for both your Microsoft Service Account (Live ID) and your work account (Active Directory).

**Resolution:**

1. Open [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) from a private or incognito browser window.
1. Create a Teams account, and then sign in by using the credentials for your work or school account.
1. If it doesn't work, you must unlink the two accounts to create a free Teams account. For more information, see [Change the email address or phone number for your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/change-the-email-address-or-phone-number-for-your-microsoft-account-761a662d-8032-88f4-03f3-c9ba8ba0e00b).

### Cause 3: You're trying to sign up for your work account by using a free tenant

For more information about tenant, see [Tenants](/microsoft-365/enterprise/subscriptions-licenses-accounts-and-tenants-for-microsoft-cloud-offerings?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true#tenants).

**Resolution:**

Use your organization's tenant for this account. For personal use, create a free Teams account by using a personal email address.
