description: Resolves an issue where Teams opens with a white screen when you use a Unix symlink or drive map to C:\users.
---

# Teams starts with a white screen

## Symptoms

When you use a Unix symlink or map a drive to C:\users, a white screen appears when the Teams app starts.

## Cause

When you use an installation script to install Microsoft Teams to Program Files instead of the default location, the client won't automatically update when a new version is available. This is an expected limitation of Teams if the installation location is changed by a custom script.

## Resolution

Make sure that you install the application in the default location: `user\Appdata`. If the mapping must exist, use the web version of Microsoft Teams instead.
