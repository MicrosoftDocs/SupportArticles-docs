# SBC certificate is invalid

## Symptoms

Teams SIP proxy is rejecting incoming and/or outgoing connection attempts. After packet capture or certificate inspection, you find that the SBC certificate is invalid (for example, expired or revoked).

## Resolution

Request or renew the certificate from your CA. Then, install it on the SBC according to the vendorâ€™s SBC configuration guide.
