# Can't find Viva Connections app in Teams mobile

Your organization has added the custom line of business Viva Connections desktop app. Users can see the app in Microsoft Teams on their desktop but canâ€™t find the app in Teams on their mobile devices.

You can check the details of the installed app in the Microsoft Teams admin center:

- Select [**Teams Apps** > **Manage Apps**](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/policies/manage-apps).
- Search for the app, and then select it.
