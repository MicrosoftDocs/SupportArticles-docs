# Get support for Viva Glint

To get help with technical or product issues related to Microsoft Viva Glint, follow the steps in this article to submit an online support request.

## Before you start

Before submitting a support request, make sure that:

- You have all the details of your support request.
- You're assigned a role that has access to the Microsoft 365 admin center and have permissions to submit a support request.

To manage Microsoft 365 admin center support requests as a Viva Glint administrator, ask your Microsoft 365 global admin to [add](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide#steps-add-an-admin&preserve-view=true) you to the [Service Support admin role](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide#commonly-used-microsoft-365-admin-center-roles&preserve-view=true) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> The Service Support admin role for the Microsoft 365 admin center isn't limited to Viva Glint support requests, but can view all Microsoft 365 support requests.
