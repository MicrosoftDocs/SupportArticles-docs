# Get support for Viva Glint

To get help for technical or product issues that are related to Microsoft Viva Glint, follow the steps in this article to submit an online support request.

## Before you start

Before you submit a support request, make sure that:

- You have all the details of your issue.
- You're assigned a role that has access to the Microsoft 365 admin center.
- You have the necessary permissions to submit a support request.

To manage Microsoft 365 admin center support requests as a Viva Glint Administrator, confirm that your Microsoft 365 global admin has [added](/viva/glint/setup/post-provisioning-next-steps#assign-viva-glint-tenant-admins) you to the [Viva Glint Tenant Administrator role](/viva/glint/start/role-definitions#viva-glint-tenant-administrator) in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

> [!NOTE]
> The Viva Glint Tenant Administrator role for the Microsoft 365 admin center isn't limited to Viva Glint support requests. It enables you to view all Azure and Microsoft 365 support requests.

## Collect network trace information

Support agents can more effectively troubleshoot errors that users encounter if you provide detailed network activity information as HTTP Archive (HAR) files.

To generate and save network trace information from your browser, follow the steps in [Collect a network trace in the browser](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2281838).
