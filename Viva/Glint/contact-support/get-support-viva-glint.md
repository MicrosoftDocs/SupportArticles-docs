# Get support for Viva Glint

To get help for technical or product issues that are related to Microsoft Viva Glint, follow the steps in this article to submit an online support request.

Before you submit a support request, make sure that:

> [!NOTE]
> The Service Support admin role for the Microsoft 365 admin center isn't limited to Viva Glint support requests. It enables you to view all Microsoft 365 support requests.
