### Missing organization insights

If you can't see organization insights in the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web, your organization might not have the minimum number of licenses assigned, or you don't meet the minimum team size.

Contact your Microsoft 365 admin and Insights Administrator to make sure that:

* At least 10 people in your organization have licenses.
* You have the right license and role assigned to access organization insights.
* Your team members all have licenses, your team meets the minimum team size, and your team members are correctly mapped to you in the organizational data uploaded to Viva Insights.
