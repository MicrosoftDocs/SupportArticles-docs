| This experience is currently unavailable for your organization. To unlock the potential of Copilot Analytics and the Viva Insights advanced analyst workbench, please contact your Microsoft 365 administrator. | This error occurs when your organization hasn't yet set up Viva Insights or the Copilot Dashboard.

| Unauthorized access. Kindly refresh the page to regain access.

| It looks like you don't have the necessary permissions. Please contact your Microsoft 365 administrator to be assigned a role for Viva Insights. | This error means your account doesn't have the correct permissions to access certain features.

| Viva Insights is below the minimum assigned license requirement for this experience.

If they've already been assigned, please check back later as we get set up. | This occurs when your organization hasn't assigned enough licenses to Viva Insights to employees from whom you're measuring workplace behaviors. Some features might remain restricted until the licensing requirement is fulfilled. This license requirement ensures that data can be presented at an aggregated level without enabling individual behaviors to be definitively identified.  | Contact your Viva Insights administrator to confirm and resolve license-related issues. If licenses have already been assigned, allow some time for the system to update before retrying. | [Learn how to assign licenses in Viva Insights](/viva/insights/advanced/setup-maint/assign-licenses). |

|  Advanced Insights setup is not complete. To use the advanced insights app, your Viva Insights administrator must complete additional setup steps. | This error occurs when your organization's Viva Insights admin still has configuration steps to complete before Microsoft can begin processing data. This is common when the tool has been newly activated for your organization. You might also receive this message if you're using a demo tenant, because demo tenants can't access advanced analysis capabilities.  | Wait a few days for your tenant admin to complete the necessary steps and for data processing to complete.

### Missing organization insights

If you can't see organization insights in the Viva Insights app in Teams or on the web, your organization might not have the minimum number of licenses assigned, or you don't meet the minimum team size.

Contact your Microsoft 365 admin and Insights Administrator to make sure that:

* At least 50 people in your organization have licenses.
* You have the right license and role assignment to access organization insights.
* Your team members all have licenses, your team meets the minimum team size, and your team members are correctly mapped to you in the organizational data uploaded to Viva Insights.
