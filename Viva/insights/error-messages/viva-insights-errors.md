### Missing organization insights

If you can't see organization insights in the Viva Insights app (either in Microsoft Teams or on the web), your organization might not be assigned the minimum number of licenses, or it might not meet the team size requirement.

Contact your Microsoft 365 admin and Insights Administrator to make sure that the following requirements are met:

* At least 50 people in your organization have licenses.
* You have the appropriate license and role assignment to access organization insights.
* All your team members have licenses, your team meets the minimum team size, and your team members are correctly mapped to you in the organizational data that's uploaded to Viva Insights.
