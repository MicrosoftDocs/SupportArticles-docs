> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD and MSOnline PowerShell modules are deprecated as of March 30, 2024. To learn more, read the [deprecation update](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270). After this date, support for these modules are limited to migration assistance to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK and security fixes. The deprecated modules will continue to function through March, 30 2025.
>
> We recommend migrating to [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview) to interact with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). For common migration questions, refer to the [Migration FAQ](/powershell/azure/active-directory/migration-faq). *Note:* Versions 1.0.x of MSOnline may experience disruption after June 30, 2024.
