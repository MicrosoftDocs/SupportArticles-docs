# Troubleshoot data freshness alerts in Azure AD Connect Health

This article offers common diagnostic fixes for the data freshness alert "Health service data is not up to date", which is generated when the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect Health Service hasn't received data in the last two hours. The alert occurs in the Health Service for the following services:

- Azure AD Sync service
- Azure AD Domain Services (Azure AD DS)
- Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

## Prerequisites

- [Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594).
- The [Azure AD Connect Health agent for AD DS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=820540).
- The [Azure AD Connect Health agent for Azure AD FS](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=518973).
- The [PsExec](/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) tool.

## Symptoms

To view the data freshness alert, take the following steps:

1. In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Azure AD Connect Health**.

1. In the **Azure Active Directory Connect Health | Quick start** menu pane, select **AD DS Services**.

1. Select your domain name, and then select **Alerts**.

1. In the **Active Directory Domain Services Alerts** pane, select **Health service data is not up to date.**

1. In the **Health service data is not up to date** pane, select the **Server Name**. The lists of properties for **Alert Details** and **Data Type Details** appear.

## Common diagnostic steps

Before you continue, see [Health service data is not up to date alert](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-data-freshness).

## HTTP proxy troubleshooting steps

If you use an HTTP proxy, follow these steps:

1. If Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) inspection is turned on, make sure that you've added the policy key service endpoint (`policykeyservice.dc.ad.msft.net`) to the allow list.

1. Use a PowerShell cmdlet to find connectivity issues. You can [run the Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity cmdlet](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-health-agent-install#test-connectivity-to-azure-ad-connect-health-service) successfully as a regular user. However, if all data types are missing, the proxy setting might be correct for the user but not for **Local System** (the context that the service runs under). In that case, run the appropriate `Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivityAsSystem` cmdlet instead:

    ### [Sync](#tab/sync)

    ```powershell
    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivityAsSystem -Role Sync
    ```

    ### [AD DS](#tab/azure-ad-ds)

    ```powershell
    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivityAsSystem -Role ADDS
    ```

    ### [AD FS](#tab/ad-fs)

    ```powershell
    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivityAsSystem -Role ADFS
    ```

    ---

1. To check whether the proxy settings are correct for **Local System**:

    1. Enter the following `PsExec` command to view the Windows settings remotely:

        ```console
        PsExec.exe -i -s "start ms-settings:"
        ```

    1. Select **Network & internet** > **Proxy**, and then select **Edit** under the **Manual proxy setup** heading.

    1. In the **Edit proxy server** dialog box, update the proxy server settings to match the current setup.

    1. Restart the services.

## Performance counter troubleshooting steps

Run the following PowerShell commands to check for the existence of certain performance counter categories.

### [Sync](#tab/sync)

```powershell
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Processor")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("TCPv4")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Memory")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Process")
```

### [AD DS](#tab/azure-ad-ds)

```powershell
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Processor")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("TCPv4")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Memory")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Process")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("DirectoryServices(NTDS)")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("Security System-Wide Statistics")
[System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounterCategory]::Exists("LogicalDisk")
```

### [AD FS](#tab/ad-fs)

Microsoft is developing scripts that apply to AD FS, and will post those scripts in this article when they become available.

)
foreach($counter in $perfCounters)
{
    try
    {
        $counterResult = Get-Counter -Counter $counter -MaxSamples 1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        if($counterResult -eq $null)
        {
            Write-Host $counter " ->  does not exist" -ForegroundColor Red

## Collect logs for the Monitoring Agent and Insights Agent

If the dashboard isn't helping, collect the agent logs. The relevant service can be run in the console to get more information.

Begin by entering the following `PsExec` command to run the command prompt remotely:

```console
PsExec.exe -i -s cmd
```

Then, collect the agent logs for the Monitoring and Insights services of Sync, AD DS, or AD FS, as described in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> AD FS also has a Diagnostics service. Instructions for collecting the corresponding Diagnostic Agent logs are shown after the log collection sections for Monitoring and Insights.

### Collect Monitoring Agent logs

To collect Monitoring Agent logs, follow these steps:

1. At the remote command prompt, enter `services.msc` to open the Services snap-in.

1. Stop the Monitoring Service for the appropriate service type.

    For example, for AD FS, select **Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Monitoring Service** from the list of services, then select the **Stop Service** icon.

1. Change the current directory to the appropriate directory according to the service type. Then, open the configuration file of the Monitoring Agent service executable in a text editor (such as Notepad) for editing. The path name and executable file name for each service type is shown in the following table. The configuration file name simply appends the `.config` file name extension to the end of the executable file name.

    | Service type | Path                                                                       | Executable                                                      |
    | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sync         | *C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Azure AD Connect Health Sync Agent\\Monitor* | *Microsoft.Identity.Health.AadSync.MonitoringAgent.Startup.exe* |
    | AD DS        | *C:\\Program Files\\Azure Ad Connect Health Adds Agent\\Monitor*           | *Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adds.MonitoringAgent.Startup.exe*    |
    | AD FS        | *C:\\Program Files\\Azure Ad Connect Health Adfs Agent\\Monitor*           | *Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.MonitoringAgent.Startup.exe*    |

    For example, for AD FS, enter the following commands:

    ```console
    cd "C:\Program Files\Azure Ad Connect Health Adfs Agent\Monitor"
    notepad "Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.MonitoringAgent.Startup.exe.config"
    ```

1. In the text editor, insert the following line to set the `ConsoleDebug` key to `true`:

    ```xml
    <add key="ConsoleDebug" value="true" />
    ```

1. Save and close the configuration file.

1. Run the Monitoring Agent service, and direct its output to a log file (*monitor.log*).

    For example, for AD FS, enter the following command:

    ```console
    Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.MonitoringAgent.Startup.exe > monitor.log
    ```

1. Let the Monitoring Agent service run for 15 minutes. Then, press Ctrl+C to stop the service, and inspect the *monitor.log* file.

### Collect Insights Agent logs

To collect Insights Agent logs, follow these steps:

1. At the remote command prompt, enter `services.msc` to open the Services snap-in.

1. Stop the Insights service for the appropriate service type.

    For example, for AD FS, select **Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Insights Service** from the list of services, then select the **Stop Service** icon.

1. Change the current directory to the appropriate directory according to the service type. Then, run the Insights Agent service executable by using the `/console` parameter and direct its output to a log file (*insights.log*). The path name and executable file name for each service type is shown in the following table.

    | Service type | Path                                                                        | Executable                                              |
    | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sync         | *C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Azure AD Connect Health Sync Agent\\Insights* | *Microsoft.Identity.AadConnect.Health.AadSync.Host.exe* |
    | AD DS        | *C:\\Program Files\\Azure Ad Connect Health Adds Agent\\Insights*           | *Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adds.InsightsService.exe*    |
    | AD FS        | *C:\\Program Files\\Azure Ad Connect Health Adfs Agent\\Insights*           | *Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.InsightsService.exe*    |

    For example, for AD FS, enter the following commands:

    ```console
    cd "C:\Program Files\Azure Ad Connect Health Adfs Agent\Insights"
    Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.InsightsService.exe /console > insights.log
    ```

1. Let the Insights Agent service run for 15 minutes. Then press Ctrl+C to stop the service, and inspect the *insights.log* file.

## Collect logs for the Diagnostics Agent (for AD FS only)

To collect Diagnostics Agent logs for AD FS, follow these steps:

1. In the remote command prompt, enter `services.msc` to open the Services snap-in.

1. Stop the Diagnostics service for the appropriate service type.

    For example, for AD FS, select **Azure AD Connect Health AD FS Diagnostics Service** from the list of services, then select the **Stop Service** icon.

1. Change the current directory to the diagnostics directory for AD FS. Then, run the Diagnostics Agent service executable by using the `-Debug` parameter, and direct its output to a log file (*diagnostics.log*).

    ```console
    cd "C:\Program Files\Azure Ad Connect Health Adfs Agent\Diagnostics"
    Microsoft.Identity.Health.Adfs.DiagnosticsAgent.exe -Debug > diagnostics.log
    ```

1. Press Enter.

1. Let the Diagnostics Agent service run for 15 minutes. Then, press Ctrl+C to stop the service, and copy the console output into *diagnostics.log*.

1. Search for `Error` in the logs, and check whether any error entry indicates a specific problem (such as connectivity or proxy configuration).
