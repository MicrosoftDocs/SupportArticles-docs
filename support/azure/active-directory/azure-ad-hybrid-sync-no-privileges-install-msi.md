# Azure AD Hybrid Sync Agent Installation Issues - No privileges to install MSI

This troubleshooting guide focuses on when you don't have privileges to install MSI. Without these privileges, you may be unable to successfully install the Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent.

## Prerequisites

To install *Cloud Provisioning Agent*, the following prerequisites are required: [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/how-to-prerequisites).

## No privileges to install MSI

While installing Cloud Provisioning Agent, you may get the following error:

> Service 'Microsoft Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent' (AADConnectProvisioningAgent) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services.

To verify that you have sufficient privileges:

1. Make sure the user context credentials are set to either Domain Administrator or Enterprise Administrator.

1. Open the Local Security Policy snap-in (*secpol.msc*). In the **Security Settings** pane, select **Local policies** > **User Rights Assignment**. Then select the **Log on as a service** policy.

1. Select **Action** > **Properties**. Then in **Local Security Setting**, make sure the `NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES` group appears.

During package installation, the service **AADConnectProvisioningAgent** is created, and logon credentials are temporarily set to **NT Service\AADConnectProvisioningAgent**.

If **Log on as a service** doesn't have *ALL SERVICES* listed, the installation fails to start, and it shows the previously listed error message.

To resolve this issue, provide *ALL SERVICES* user rights to **Log on as a service**.

The wizard now completes successfully.
