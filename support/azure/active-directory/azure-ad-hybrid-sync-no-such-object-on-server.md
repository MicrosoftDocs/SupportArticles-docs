# Azure AD Hybrid Sync Agent Installation Issues - There is no such object on the server

This troubleshooting guide focuses on when an object reference isn't set to an object instance. This situation may block you from installing the Azure AD Connect Provisioning Agent.

## Prerequisites

To install *Cloud Provisioning Agent*, the following prerequisites are required: [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/how-to-prerequisites).

## Scenario 1

When installing Cloud Provisioning Agent, you may get this error during installation process.

> Error while creating group managed service account (gMSA). Error: There is no such object on the server.

It includes an error saying there isn't a group Managed Service Account (g M S A) object on the server." border="true" lightbox="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/1-agent-configuration-error-creating-gmsa-v1.png":::

The installation wizard's trace file isn't clear about what's missing:

```output
[15:16:14.583] [ 16] [ERROR] Exception creating gmsa. Exception: System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesCOMException (0x80072030): There is no such object on the server.

   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind(Boolean throwIfFail)
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.Bind()
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.get_NativeObject()
   at System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryEntry.InvokeGet(String propertyName)
   at Microsoft.Online.Deployment.Framework.Providers.GroupManagedServiceAccountProvider.CreateGroupManagedAccount(String serviceAccountName, String serviceDnsName, String username, String password)
[15:16:14.585] [ 16] [ERROR] Exception caught while creating gmsa. Exception: System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesCOMException (0x80072030): There is no such object on the server.
```

To resolve the issue in this scenario, use the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in (*dsa.msc*). This snap-in verifies within the domain controller whether the **Managed Service Account** container is present.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/2-active-directory-users-computers.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Active Directory Users and Computers window." border="true":::

If the container is missing, contact the Windows Directory Services Team to restore or create the container with the `ADPrep /Domainprep` command.

The following items are [Active Directory Domain Service requirements](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts):

> The Active Directory schema in the gMSA domain's forest needs to be updated to Windows Server 2012 to create a gMSA.
>
> You can update the schema by installing a domain controller that runs Windows Server 2012 or by running the version of *adprep.exe* from a computer running Windows Server 2012. The object-version attribute value for the object `CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=< name of DC >,DC=Com` must be 52.

## Scenario 2

In a similar scenario as above, you may get the following error:

> Error when creating group managed service account (gMSA). Error: There is no such object on the server.

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/3-agent-configuration-error-creating-gmsa-v2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the agent configuration screen. It shows an error that says there isn't a group Managed Service Account (g M S A) object on the server." border="true" lightbox="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/3-agent-configuration-error-creating-gmsa-v2.png":::

The wizard trace shows the following information:

```output
[01:12:13.924] [  9] [INFO ] IsServiceAccountGMSA:: Checking if service account is gmsa
[01:12:13.924] [  9] [INFO ] Get current service credentials.

```

Once you verify and confirm that Managed Service account container is present at the domain, a client Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) trace shows the following information:

```output
9638 [2]0144.1380::04/14/21-14:17:20.2063638 [Microsoft_Windows_LDAP_Client/Debug16 ] Message=ldap_search called for connection 0x4392e0d8: DN is <WKGUID=1eb93889e40c45df9f0c64d23bbb6237,DC=*****,DC=com>. SearchScope is 0x0. AttributesOnly is 0x0.

9681 [1]0144.1380::04/14/21-14:17:20.2076151 [Microsoft_Windows_LDAP_Client/Debug16 ] Message=32 30 30 31 20 28 4e 4f 5f 4f 42 4a 45 43 54 29  2001.(NO_OBJECT)
```

The agent couldn't find the WellKnown globally unique identifier (GUID) for the Managed Service Accounts (MSA) container.

This error can be verified with the following PowerShell command:

```powershell
$ListOWKO = Get-ADObject (Get-ADRootDSE).DefaultNamingContext -Properties otherwellKnownObjects

$ListOWKO.otherwellKnownObjects
```

The output of the previous command displays the following results:

```output
B:32:1EB93889E40C45DF9F0C64D23BBB6237:CN=Managed Service Accounts\0ADEL:8b637607-65e8-4a80-b194-f738b26b9414,CN=Deleted Objects,DC=< name of DC >,DC=com
```

:::image type="content" source="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/4-powershell-output-for-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the output for the Active Directory command. The output shows the missing attribute within the other well-known objects." border="true" lightbox="media/azure-ad-hybrid-sync-no-such-object-on-server/4-powershell-output-for-attribute.png":::

This orphan metadata value indicates one of these scenarios:

- The MSA container was previously deleted and wasn't properly restored.
- The value is missing.

The default value for the **OtherWellKnownObjects** attribute is:

> B:32:1EB93889E40C45DF9F0C64D23BBB6237:CN=Managed Service Accounts,**DC=< name of DC >,DC=com**

To resolve this issue, open a ticket with Windows Directory Services Team.
