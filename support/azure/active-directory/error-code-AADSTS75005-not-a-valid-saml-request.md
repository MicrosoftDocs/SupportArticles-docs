# Error AADSTS75005 - The request is not a valid Saml2 protocol message

This article describes a problem in which you receive the error message "Error AADSTS75005 - The request is not a valid Saml2 protocol message." when trying to sign into a SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured app that has been integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Symptoms

You receive error `AADSTS75005` when trying to sign into an application that has been setup to use Azure AD for identity management using SAML-based SSO.

## Cause

Azure AD doesnâ€™t support the SAML request sent by the application for single sign-on. Some common issues are:

- Missing required fields in the SAML request.
- SAML request encoded method.

## Resolution

1. Capture the SAML request. Follow the tutorial [How to debug SAML-based single sign-on to applications in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/debug-saml-sso-issues) to learn how to capture the SAML request.
1. Contact the application vendor and share the following info:
    - SAML request
    - [Azure AD Single Sign-on SAML protocol requirements](/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol)

The application vendor should validate that they support the Azure AD SAML implementation for single sign-on.
