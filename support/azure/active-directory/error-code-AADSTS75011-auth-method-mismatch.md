# Error - AADSTS75011 Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef

This article describes a problem in which you receive the error message "Error - AADSTS75011 Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef." when trying to sign into a SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured app that has been integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

## Symptoms

You receive error `AADSTS75011` when trying to sign into an application that has been setup to use Azure AD for identity management using SAML-based SSO.

## Cause

The `RequestedAuthnContext` is in the SAML request. This means the app is expecting the `AuthnContext` specified by the `AuthnContextClassRef`. However, the user has already authenticated prior to access the application and the `AuthnContext` (authentication method) used for that previous authentication is different from the one being requested. For example, a federated user access to MyApps and WIA occurred. The `AuthnContextClassRef` will be `urn:federation:authentication:windows`. AAD wonâ€™t perform a fresh authentication request, it will use the authentication context that was passed-through it by the IdP (ADFS or any other federation service in this case). Therefore, there will be a mismatch if the app requests other than `urn:federation:authentication:windows`. Another scenario is when MultiFactor was used: `'X509, MultiFactor`.

## Resolution

`RequestedAuthnContext` is an optional value. Then, if possible, ask the application if it could be removed.

Another option is to make sure the `RequestedAuthnContext` will be honored. This will be done by requesting a fresh authentication. By doing this, when the SAML request is processed, a fresh authentication will be done and the `AuthnContext` will be honored. To request a Fresh Authentication the SAML request most contain the value `forceAuthn="true"`.
