# Troubleshoot Azure AD Connect installation issues

This article provides information about troubleshooting a problem in which you receive an error message that prevents you from installing Azure AD Connect.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, Cloud Services (Web roles/Worker roles), Office 365 Identity Management  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3121701

## Procedure

1. Identify the error message. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. Go to the `%ProgramData%\AADConnect` folder, and then open the Synchronization Service_install.txt file.
    2. Search for this string: **value 3**
    3. Locate the error message just before the **value 3** string in the file.

2. Troubleshoot the actual error message.

## Example

Installation failures can occur for many reasons. Here's an example of what to look for in the Synchronization Service_install.txt file.

```console
MSI (s) (2C!64) [15:48:23:562]: Product: Forefront Identity Manager Synchronization Service -- Error 25009.
The Forefront Identity Manager Synchronization Service setup wizard cannot configure the specified database.
Invalid object name 'mms_management_agent'. A required privilege is not held by the client.
Error 25009.The Forefront Identity Manager Synchronization Service setup wizard cannot configure the specified
database.
Invalid object name 'mms_management_agent'. A required privilege is not held by the client.
CustomAction ConfigDB returned actual error code 1603 (note this may not be 100% accurate if translation
happened inside sandbox)
Action ended 15:48:23: InstallFinalize. Return value 3.
```

In this example, the actual error message is the following:

> Service -- Error 25009.The Forefront Identity Manager Synchronization Service setup wizard cannot configure the specified database. Invalid object name 'mms_management_agent'. A required privilege is not held by the client.

A search for the error returns the following TechNet topic that you can use to troubleshoot the problem:
