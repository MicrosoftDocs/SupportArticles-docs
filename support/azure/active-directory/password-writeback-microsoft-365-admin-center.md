# Troubleshoot admin password resets in Microsoft 365 admin center

This article describes a password writeback issue that occurs after an administrator resets a user password in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

## Symptoms

A user who recently had an administrator reset their password can't sign in to on-premises Active Directory by using the new password. Additionally, the previous password might still work.

## Cause

An administrator has reset the password of a user in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). Although the user can sign in online by using the new password, the new password isn't synchronized back to on-premises Active Directory.

Currently, the Microsoft 365 admin center doesn't use the self-service password reset (SSPR) and password writeback libraries. When an administrator resets a user password in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the password is reset in Azure AD, but the new password isn't updated in on-premises Active Directory. Therefore, the user password is now out-of-sync between on-premises Active Directory and Azure AD.

## Solution

To make sure that password writeback updates the new password in on-premises Active Directory, the administrator who changes or resets the password must use [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) instead of [the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com).
