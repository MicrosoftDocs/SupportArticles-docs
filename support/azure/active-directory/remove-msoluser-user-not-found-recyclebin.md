## Symptoms

When you try to remove a user from the recycle bin (also sometimes known as the Deleted Users container) in a Microsoft cloud service such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Intune, or Microsoft Azure, you receive the following error message:

> Remove-MsolUser: User Not Found

For example, you experience these symptoms when you run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Remove-MsolUser -RemoveFromRecyleBin
```

## Cause

This problem occurs if the user who is performing the action is not a global admin.

## Resolution

Take one of the following actions:

- Have someone assign the global admin role to you, and then remove the user from the recycle bin.
- Have a global admin remove the user from the recycle bin.
- Wait 30 days. Deleted users will remain in the recycle bin for 30 days. After 30 days, they are automatically removed from the recycle bin.
