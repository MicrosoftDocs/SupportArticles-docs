# RPC errors affecting AADConnect

Customers may experience issues where they cannot configure AADConnect and or enable features due to Remote Procedure Call (RPC) related errors.

Customers may also experience features previously enabled stop working due to these types of errors.  

In the vast majority of cases, the issue is affecting AADConnect and not caused by AADConnect, so finding the exact underlying problem is crucial to correctly define troubleshooting steps and identify the right underlying issue causing the errors.

This article cover examples of AADConnect features affected by RPC errors.

## Investigating a Remote Procedure Call error affecting AADConnect

When an issue is identified, it is generally recommended as part of troubleshooting initial steps, to carefully investigate Application events using Event Viewer. Determining the system error being returned from the remote procedure call will help you target your investigation and define the right troubleshooting methods and tools.

For these types of errors, Application events include information about the RPC error such as in the following examples:

### Example 1

Snippet from the Application error event seen in the previous image:

```dos
Log Name:      Application
Source:        Directory Synchronization
Date:          8/10/2020 11:00:39 AM
Event ID:      611
Task Category: None
Level:         Error
Keywords:      Classic
User:          N/A
Computer:      server1.contoso.com
Description:   Password hash synchronization failed for domain: contoso.com, domain controller hostname: <not available>, domain controller IP address: <not available>.
Details:       Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.SynchronizationManagerException: Unable to open connection to domain: contoso.com. Error: There was an error establishing a connection to the directory replication service. Domain controller hostname: server1.contoso.com, domain controller IP address: 10.0.0.202 ---> Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.DirectoryReplicationServices.DrsCommunicationException: There was an error establishing a connection to the directory replication service. Domain controller hostname: server1.contoso.com, domain controller IP address: 10.0.0.202 ---> Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.DirectoryReplicationServices.
DrsException:  There was an error creating the connection context. ---> Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.DirectoryReplicationServices.DrsCommunicationException: RPC Error 1722 : The RPC server is unavailable. Error creating the RPC binding handle
```

In this case, the RPC communication failed with error **"1722 : The RPC server is unavailable"**.

[System Error Codes 1700-3999](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--1700-3999-)

In this example, the error is affecting AADConnect password synchronization feature.

### Troubleshooting Example 1

The error in Example 1 is a common networking related error for which troubleshooting steps can be found in [Troubleshoot TCP/IP RPC Errors](/windows/client-management/troubleshoot-tcpip-rpc-errors).

In this scenario, investigating a network trace reveals retransmit packets being sent for communication with destination **port 135**, so traffic on this port is being blocked on the destination server.

:::image type="content" source="media/rpc-errors-aadconnect/traffic-block.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows that traffic is being blocked on the destination server." lightbox="media/rpc-errors-aadconnect/traffic-block.png":::

These errors can manifest intermittently, which adds complexity to the process of collecting data, like a network trace, for investigation and troubleshooting.

The following steps allow you to automatically collect a network trace, when the error event id is generated.

> [!NOTE]
> To automatically collect an network trace, **Microsoft Network Monitor** must be installed on the AADConnect server.
>
> [Download Netmon](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4865)

1. From an elevated command prompt, run the following command:

   ```dos
   nmcap /network * /Capture /file c:\MSData\%Computername%_Trace.cap:500M /StopWhen /Frame (ICMP and Ipv4.TotalLength == 328) /CaptureProcesses /TimeAfter 2s
   ```

2. To stop the trace when the error is generated, send a Ping with the correct size.

   Prepare the Ping Command in a script (cmd file for instance) that you execute when the AADConnect throws the Error in Event log.

   Ping command:

   ```dos
   ping -l 300 -n 2 1.2.3.4
   ```

3. Attach a task that runs the cmd file created in the previous step to the event that is generated when the issue reproduces. That will trigger the ping command that stops the trace.

### Example 2

   :::image type="content" source="media/rpc-errors-aadconnect/rpc-error-8333.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the application events include information about the R P C error 8333.":::

Snippet from the Application error event seen in the previous image:

```dos
Log Name:      Application
Source:        Directory Synchronization
Date:          8/3/2020 8:17:55 PM
Event ID:      611
Task Category: None
Level:         Error
Keywords:      Classic
User:          N/A
Computer:      server1.contoso.com
Description:   Password hash synchronization failed for domain: contoso.com, domain controller hostname: server1.contoso.com, domain controller IP address: 192.168.0.0.
Details:       Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.SynchronizationManagerException: Recovery task failed. ---> Microsoft.Online.PasswordSynchronization.DirectoryReplicationServices.
DrsException:  RPC Error 8333 : Directory object not found. There was an error calling _IDL_DRSGetNCChanges.
```

Other infrastructure configuration issues may contribute to Remote Procedure Call problems, such as DNS name resolution, Authentication problems, etc.

It's important to note the error number for appropriate investigation and troubleshooting.

### Troubleshooting Example 2

In Example 2 the Remote Procedure Call returned error is **8333**, an error for **"Directory object not found"**

[System Error Codes 8200-8999](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--8200-8999-)

AADConnect server was not able to find the user object for which it is trying to perform Password Hash Synchronization in Active Directory.

```

It's important to know that errors can be represented in their hexadecimal code, like in this example.

You can also use the hexadecimal error code to search the error symbolic name.

The error **"0x6ba"** translates to an **"RPC Server Unavailable" error 1722**. The troubleshooting steps used in **Example 1** also apply here.

### Example 4

Another example with the RPC error represented in its hexadecimal form:

:::image type="content" source="media/rpc-errors-aadconnect/error-failed-0x5.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows an example with the R P C error represented in its hexadecimal form.":::

In this case, the error returned **"0x5"** translates to an access denied error:

[System Error Codes 0-499](/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-)  

There may be various reasons to raise an access denied error. Hardening group policies implemented in Active Directory is one of them. One example is restricting clients allowed to make calls to SAM:
