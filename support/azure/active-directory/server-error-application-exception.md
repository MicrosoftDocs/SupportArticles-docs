Line 106: {  
Line 107: ...  
Line 108: OpenIdConnectConfiguration config = await mgr.GetConfigurationAsync();  
Line 109: ...  
Line 110: }

## Cause

This problem occurs if the **Policy Name** setting for sign-in, password reset, or the user profile is missing or incorrect in the web.config file for your app.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the web.config file for your app.
2. In this file, verify the following:
   - The ida:SignInPolicyId  app key exists, and you've replaced the value with the name of the Sign-in policy that you provided in the Azure B2C Admin Portal.
   - The ida:PasswordResetPolicyId  app key exists, and you've replaced the value with the name of the Sign-in policy that you provided in the Azure B2C Admin Portal.
   - The ida:UserProfilePolicyId  app key exists, and you've replaced the value with the name of the Sign-in policy that you provided in the Azure B2C Admin Portal.

    The web.config file should resemble the following:

    ```console
    <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="ida:SignInPolicyId" value="B2C_Signin_Policy">
    <add key="ida:PasswordResetPolicyId" value="B2C_PasswordReset_Policy">
    <add key="ida:UserProfilePolicyId" value="B2C_UserProfile_Policy">
    ...
    </appSettings>
    ```
