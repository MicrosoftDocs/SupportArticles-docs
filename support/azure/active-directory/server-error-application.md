 [IOException: Unable to get document from: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/contoso.onmicrosoft.com/.well-known/openid-configuration?p=Policyname`]  

## Cause

The sign-up policy name may be missing or incorrect in the Web.config file for the app.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the Web.config file for the app.
2. In the Web.config file, verify that the app key `ida:SignUpPolicyId` exists.
3. Replace the value of the app key with the name of the sign-up policy that you provided in the Azure AD B2C admin portal.

    The changed part of the file resembles the following:

    ```console
    <appSettings>
    <add key="ida:SignUpPolicyId" value="B2C_Signup_Policy_Name">
    </appSettings>
    ```
