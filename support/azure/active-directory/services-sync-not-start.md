# One or more Azure Active Directory Connect services don't start

This article describes an issue that prevents Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Connect services from starting.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Active Directory, Office 365 Identity Management  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2995030

## Symptoms

You discover that one or more Azure AD Connect services don't start. For example, the Microsoft Azure AD Sync service (ADSync) doesn't start.

## Solution 1: Set User Rights Assignment permissions within Group Policy

Make group policy changes if necessary so that the ADSync service account can log on locally, as a service, and as a batch job. Because a domain group policy takes precedence over a local group policy, you need to check the settings for both types of group policies.

1. Select **Start**, enter _gpedit.msc_ in the search box, and then press Enter to open the Local Group Policy Editor snap-in.

1. In the console tree, under **Computer Configuration**, expand **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies**, and then select **User Rights Assignment**.

1. Verify that the ADSync service account is added for the following policy settings:

   - **Allow log on locally**
   - **Log on as a batch job**
   - **Log on as a service**

1. For domain group policies, open an administrative command prompt.

1. Run the following [gpresult](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/gpresult) command, which generates a group policy report:

   ```cmd
   gpresult /H gpresult.htm
   ```

1. Open the resulting group policy report (*gpresult.htm*).

1. If **User Rights Assignment** settings are applied through any domain group policy object (GPO), use the **Group Policy Management** console (*gpmc.msc*) from a domain controller to take one of the following actions:

   - Remove the following policy settings from the **Winning GPO**:
     - **Allow log on locally**
     - **Log on as a batch job**
     - **Log on as a service**

   - Update the **Winning GPO** to include the ADSync service account.

1. If you made any changes to the local group policy or domain group policy, restart the computer to apply the changes.

## Solution 2: Troubleshoot error messages in directory synchronization logging

You can also try to find and fix the problem by scanning the application and system events in the directory synchronization logs. For more information, see [Troubleshoot other error messages](installation-configuration-wizard-errors.md#troubleshoot-other-error-messages).

## Solution 3: Reinstall directory synchronization

If solutions 1 and 2 don't resolve the issue, remove and then reinstall directory synchronization.

For example, if you use the Azure Active Directory Sync tool, remove and then reinstall it. Or, if you use Azure AD Sync, remove and then reinstall it.
