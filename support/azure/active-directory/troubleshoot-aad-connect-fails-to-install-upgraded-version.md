# Troubleshoot Azure AD Connect upgrade issues

This article describes how to troubleshoot problems that can occur when you upgrade to the latest version of Azure Active Directory Connect from previous installations of Azure AD Connect, Azure AD Sync, or DirSync.

> [!WARNING]
> You might find some online documentation that includes steps to directly edit the Windows registry. However, editing the registry can cause serious problems if you modify the registry incorrectly. The Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect product team **doesn't support** editing the Windows registry.

*Original product version:* Azure Active Directory  
*Original KB number:* 4051210  

## Symptoms

Every time that you start the Azure AD Connect setup wizard, the program evaluates all the related products and Windows Installer packages (.msi) that are currently installed. To trace this activity, follow these steps:

1. Start the Azure AD Connect wizard, and wait for the first page to open.

2. Open the `%ProgramData%\AADConnect\` folder, and analyze the latest installation trace log.

3. Locate the entries for `GetInstalledPackagesByUpgradeCode`, where the wizard evaluates all the related Windows Installer packages that are installed in Windows. For example:

   ```output
   [10:44:23.095] [ 1] [INFO ] Performing direct lookup of upgrade codes for: Azure AD Sync Engine
   [10:44:23.095] [ 1] [VERB ] Getting list of installed packages by upgrade code
   [10:44:23.095] [ 1] [INFO ] GetInstalledPackagesByUpgradeCode {545334d7-13cd-4bab-8da1-2775fa8cf7c2}: verified product code {7c4397b7-9008-4c23-8cda-3b3b8faf4312}.
   [10:44:23.095] [ 1] [INFO ] GetInstalledPackagesByUpgradeCode {dc9e604e-37b0-4efc-b429-21721cf49d0d}: no registered products found.
   [10:44:23.095] [ 1] [INFO ] GetInstalledPackagesByUpgradeCode {bef7e7d9-2ac2-44b9-abfc-3335222b92a7}: no registered products found.
   ```

You can find two similar symptoms near this part of the trace log:

<details>
<summary>Product was uninstalled but an inconsistent product code is still present in Windows</summary>
The wizard is detecting an old installation of the sync engine: "Product Azure AD Sync Engine (version 1.1.343.0) is installed, needs to be upgraded to version 1.1.380.0."

```output
[10:44:23.095] [ 1] [VERB ] Package=Microsoft Azure AD Connect synchronization services, Version=1.1.343.0, ProductCode=7c4397b7-9008-4c23-8cda-3b3b8faf4312, UpgradeCode=545334d7-13cd-4bab-8da1-2775fa8cf7c2

```

However, the Windows Installer information might be inconsistent after this product is uninstalled and the sync engine is no longer present.

Because the setup wizard is still detecting an old product code, it decides to upgrade Azure AD Sync Engine instead of doing a clean installation. Later in the upgrade process, while the installer is checking for the current service status, the installation fails because the ADSync service isn't present:

```output
[10:44:28.260] [ 1] [INFO ] ServiceControllerProvider: verifying ADSync is in state (Running)
[10:44:28.291] [ 1] [ERROR] Caught an exception while creating the initial page set on the root page.
Exception Data (Raw): System.InvalidOperationException: Service ADSync was not found on computer '.'. ---> System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The specified service does not exist as an installed service
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Product was uninstalled but a stale product code is still present in Windows</summary>

A stale product code that you find in Windows Installer packages can also cause upgrade issues.

```output

```

Azure AD Connect Setup wizard can't detect that an Azure AD Sync Engine is installed. Setup fails and returns the following error message:

```output
[15:52:17.674] [ 13] [ERROR] PerformConfigurationPageViewModel: Caught exception while installing synchronization service.
Exception Data (Raw): System.Exception: Unable to install the Synchronization Service. Please see the event log for additional details. ---> Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.Client.Framework.ProcessExecutionFailedException: Error installing msi package 'Synchronization Service.msi'.

```

This error occurs because the MSIEXEC process still tries to upgrade the Azure AD Sync Engine, as shown in the *Synchronization Service_Install-20170525-155217.log* file:

```output

Try verifying the key and running this wizard again. The system cannot find the file specified.
```

As in the previous case, the Windows Installer upgrading process fails because the ADSync service entries in the registry aren't present. The product has been previously uninstalled, leaving the Windows Installer database inconsistent.

## Solution

You can clean up the inconsistency on the Windows Installer database for the Azure AD Sync Engine product code that's identified in the trace log. (The product code can vary. For the previous examples, the problematic product code is 7c4397b7-9008-4c23-8cda-3b3b8faf4312.)

After you identify the problematic product code from the trace log, use the following methods, as appropriate.

<details>
<summary>Fix Windows Installer issues (if applicable)</summary>
The KB3139923 Windows hotfix can cause these Windows Installer issues. Therefore, we recommend that you uninstall it.

To check whether KB3139923 is installed, go to **Settings** > **Windows Update** > **Update history**. Or use PowerShell to export a list of all installed hotfixes:

```powershell
Get-Hotfix |
Select-Object HotFixID, InstalledOn, Description, InstalledBy |
Sort-Object –Property InstalledOn –Descending |
Out-File –FilePath ".\$env:COMPUTERNAME-HotFixes.txt"
```

1. If the KB3139923 hotfix is present, uninstall it, and then restart the server.

1. Download and install the [KB3072630 Windows hotfix](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47955), and then restart again.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Use the Windows Installer command-line tool to uninstall product code</summary>

To uninstall the product code for the Azure AD Sync Engine, run the Windows Installer command-line tool ([MsiExec.exe](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec)) as follows:

1. Identify the inconsistent or stale product code from the trace log (GUID), as shown in the "Symptoms" section.

1. Open an administrative Command Prompt window.

1. Enter the following line by susbtituting the actual GUID of the problematic product code:

    ```cmd
    SET productcode={<12345678-0000-abcd-0000-0123456789ab>}
    ```

1. Enter the following command, repeat the command, and then restart the server.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might see numerous reported errors because of the corrupted Windows Installer database. For any dialog box that appears, select **Yes**.

    ```cmd
    SET /a counter+=1
    & MSIEXEC /x %productcode% /qn /norestart /l*v "%ProgramData%\AADConnect\AADConnect_Uninstall-ForcedUninstall_%counter%.log" EXECUTE_UNINSTALL="1"
    ```

1. Start the Azure AD Connect wizard, and wait for the first page to open.

1. Open the `%ProgramData%\AADConnect\` folder, and analyze the latest installation trace log.

1. If the inconsistent or stale product code is no longer present in the log file, continue the wizard, and complete the installation. Otherwise, go to the next solution.

<summary>Use Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter tool</summary>

The Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter helps you automatically repair issues if you're blocked from installing or removing programs. It also fixes corrupted registry keys.

[Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed (microsoft.com)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed-cca7d1b6-65a9-3d98-426b-e9f927e1eb4d)

After you run the tool, restart the server, and then follow these steps:

1. Start the Azure AD Connect wizard, and wait for the first page to open.

1. Open the `%ProgramData%\AADConnect\` folder, and analyze the latest installation trace log.

1. If the inconsistent or stale product code is no longer present in the log file, continue the wizard, and complete the installation. If the stale product code is present, we recommend that you reinstall the Windows operating system because you can't recover the Windows Installer database from an inconsistent state.
