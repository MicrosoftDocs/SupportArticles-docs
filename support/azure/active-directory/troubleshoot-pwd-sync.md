# How to troubleshoot password synchronization when using an Azure AD sync appliance

This article helps you troubleshoot common issues that you may encounter when you synchronize passwords from the on-premises environment to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using [Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/whatis-azure-ad-connect).

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Cloud Services (Web roles/Worker roles), Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Intune, Azure Backup, Office 365 Identity Management  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2855271

## Before you start troubleshooting

Before you perform the troubleshooting steps, make sure that you have the [latest version of Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-roadmap#install-azure-ad-connect) installed.

Additionally, make sure that directory synchronization is in a healthy state. For more information, see [Troubleshoot object synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-objectsync).

## Some users can't sign in to Office 365, Azure, or Microsoft Intune

In this scenario, passwords of most users appear to be syncing. However, there are some users whose passwords appear not to sync. The following are scenarios in which a user can't sign in to a Microsoft cloud service, such as Office 365, Azure, or Intune.

### Scenario 1: The "User must change password at next logon" check box is selected for the user's account

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Take one of the following actions:
   - In the user account properties in Active Directory Users and Computers, clear the **User must change password at next logon** check box.
   - Have the user change their on-premises user account password.
   - Enable the [ForcePasswordChangeOnLogOn](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization#synchronizing-temporary-passwords-and-force-password-change-on-next-logon) feature on the Azure AD Connect server.
2. Wait a few minutes for the change to sync between the on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and Azure AD.

### Scenario 2: The user changed their password in the cloud service portal

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Have the user change their on-premises user account password.
2. Wait a few minutes for the change to sync between the on-premises AD DS and Azure AD.

### Scenario 3: Some users don't appear to be syncing to Azure AD

Possible causes are duplicate user names or email addresses.

To resolve this issue, use the IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool (IdFix) to help identify potential object-related issues in the on-premises AD DS. You can install IdFix at the following Microsoft website: [IdFix DirSync Error Remediation Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/idfix)

For more info about how to troubleshoot this issue, see [One or more objects don't sync when using the Azure Active Directory Sync tool](objects-dont-sync-ad-sync-tool.md)

### Scenario 4: Users are moved between filtered and unfiltered scopes

In this scenario, the user is moved to a scope that now allows the user to be synced. It could be when filtering is set up for domains, organizational units, or attributes.

To resolve this issue, see the **How to perform a full password sync** section.

### Scenario 5: Users can't sign in by using a new password but they can sign in by using their old password

In this scenario, you're using the Azure AD Sync Service together with password synchronization. After you disable and then re-enable directory synchronization, users can't sign in by using a new password. However, their old password still works.

To resolve this issue, re-enable password synchronization. To do it, start the Azure AD sync appliance Configuration Wizard, and then continue through the screens until you see the option to enable password synchronization.

### Scenario 6: Users can't sign in by using their password

In this scenario, the password hash doesn't successfully sync to the Azure AD Sync Service. If the user account was created in Active Directory running on a version of Windows Server earlier than Windows Server 2003, the account doesn't have a password hash.

## Directory synchronization is running but passwords of all users aren't synced

In this scenario, passwords of all users appear not to sync. It usually occurs if one of the following conditions is true:

- The **Synchronize now** check box wasn't selected.
- You enabled password synchronization after directory sync already occurred.
- A full directory sync hasn't yet completed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Password sync will not start until a full directory sync has completed.

To resolve this issue, first make sure that you enable password synchronization. To do it, start the Azure AD sync appliance Configuration Wizard, and then continue through the screens until you see the option to enable password synchronization.

After password synchronization is enabled, you must do a full password sync. See How to perform a full password sync section.

## Troubleshoot one user whose password isn't synced

To troubleshoot this issue, see [Troubleshoot password hash synchronization with Azure AD Connect sync](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/tshoot-connect-password-hash-synchronization#one-object-is-not-synchronizing-passwords-troubleshoot-by-using-the-troubleshooting-task)

## You're changing from a single-sign on (SSO) solution to password synchronization

To resolve this issue, see [How to switch from Single Sign-On to Password Sync](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/17857.how-to-switch-from-single-sign-on-to-password-sync.aspx).

### How to perform a full password sync

To do a full password sync, follow these steps, as appropriate for the Azure AD sync appliance that you're using.

1. If you're using the Azure Active Directory Sync tool:

   1. On the server where the tool is installed, open PowerShell, and then run the following command:

      ```powershell
      Import-Module DirSync
      ```

   2. Run the following commands:

      ```powershell
      Set-FullPasswordSync
      ```

      ```powershell
      Restart-Service FIMSynchronizationService -Force
      ```

2. If you're using the Azure AD Sync Service or Azure AD Connect, run the script that's on this page: [Azure AD Sync: How to Use PowerShell to Trigger a Full Password Sync](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/28433.how-to-use-powershell-to-trigger-a-full-password-sync-in-azure-ad-sync.aspx)
