    questions:
      - question:
          How do I know which migration option is right for me?
        answer:
          Review the [migration path decision tree](/azure/app-service/environment/upgrade-to-asev3#migration-path-decision-tree) to decide which option is best for your use case.


          For customers who want to migrate to ASE v3 with minimal changes to their networking configurations, the [in-place migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate) is best. It can support about one hour of application downtime. 
          
          The in-place migration feature creates your ASE v3 in the same subnet as your existing environment and uses the same networking infrastructure. You might have to consider the inbound and outbound IP address changes if you have any dependencies on these specific IPs. The in-place migration feature will also shut down and delete the old environment, and all your apps will be migrated to the new environment. Your old environment is no longer accessible. A rollback to the old environment isn't possible.

          
          If you can't support downtime, see the [side-by-side migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate). The side-by-side feature creates a new ASE v3 with all your apps in a different subnet. Your existing ASE isn't deleted until you initiate its deletion at the end of the migration process. Because of this process, there's a rollback option if you need to cancel your migration. This migration option is best for customers who want to migrate to ASE v3 with zero downtime, and it can support using a different subnet for their new environments.

          For manual migration options that allow you to migrate at your own pace, see [manual migration options](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives).

      - question: 
          Will there be any downtime during the migration?
        answer:
          It depends on the migration tool you use. With the [in-place migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate), you'll experience about one hour of downtime during the 4 to 6-hour service window required for this migration process, so plan accordingly. 

          When you migrate using the in-place migration feature, if you have a different ASE that you can direct traffic to, you can eliminate application downtime. 


          With the [side-by-side migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate), you won't experience any downtime. Your apps continue to run on your existing ASE until you complete the final step of the migration where DNS changes are effective immediately. Once you complete the final step, your old ASE is shut down and deleted.

      - question:
          Are there any prerequisites or limitations before migrating?
        answer:
          It depends on the migration tool you use. Check the documentation for the two migration tools, the [in-place migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate) or the [side-by-side migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate), to determine if there are prerequisites for the migration tool or feature. 

          If your ASE doesn't support migration with the migration tool, you must use one of the [manual methods](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives) to migrate to ASE v3. 

      - question:
          Do I need to do anything to my apps after the migration so that they can run on the new ASE?
        answer:
          No, all your apps running on the old environment are automatically migrated to the new environment and run like before. No user input is needed.

      - question:
          What properties of my ASE will change?
        answer:
          You're on ASE v3, so be sure to review the [features and how they differ](/azure/app-service/environment/overview#feature-differences) from earlier versions. 
          
          
          For ILB ASE, you keep the same ILB IP address. For internet-facing ASE, the public and outbound IP addresses change. For ELB ASE, there was previously a single IP for both inbound and outbound. For ASE v3, they're separate. For more information, see [ASE v3 networking](/azure/app-service/environment/networking#addresses). For a full comparison of the ASE version, see [ASE version comparison](/azure/app-service/environment/version-comparison).

      - question:
          Will my IPs change?
        answer:
          The platform will create the [new inbound IP (if you're migrating an ELB ASE) and outbound IP](/azure/app-service/environment/networking#addresses) addresses. When these IPs are created, the activity with your existing ASE isn't interrupted. However, you can't scale or change your existing environment. This process takes about 15 minutes to complete.

          
          When completed, you'll get the new IPs that your future ASE v3 uses. These new IPs don't affect your existing environment. 

          The IPs used by your existing environment continue to be used up until your existing environment is shut down by the [in-place migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate) or by you when your ASE v1/v2 is no longer needed. 

      - question: 
          Is there any cost to migrate my ASE?
        answer:
          There's no cost to migrate your ASE. You no longer have to pay for your previous ASE as soon as it's shut down during the migration process, and you start paying for your new ASE v3 as soon as it's deployed.

          Migrating ASE from an earlier version to v3 can help reduce your monthly cost.

          For more information about ASE v3 pricing, see the [pricing details](/azure/app-service/environment/overview#pricing).

      - question:
          What if my ASE has a custom domain suffix?
        answer:
          The migration tool supports this scenario. For more information, see the [in-place migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate#supported-scenarios) and [side-by-side migration feature](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate#supported-scenarios).

      - question:
          What if my ASE is zone-pinned?
        answer:
          Zone-pinned ASE v2 is a supported scenario for migration using the in-place migration feature. ASE v3 doesn't support zone pinning. When migrating to ASE v3, you can choose whether to configure zone redundancy.

          The side-by-side migration feature currently doesn't support this [migration scenario](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate#supported-scenarios).

      - question:
          What if my ASE has IP SSL addresses? 
        answer:
          ASE v3 doesn't support IP SSL. You must remove all IP SSL bindings before migrating using the migration feature or one of the manual options. If you intend to use the migration tool, once you remove all IP SSL bindings, you pass the validation check and can proceed with the automated migration.

      - question:
          Is backup and restore supported for moving apps from ASE v2 to v3?
        answer:
          Yes. The [backup and restore](/azure/app-service/manage-backup?tabs=portal) feature allows you to keep your app configuration, file content, and database connected to your app when migrating to your new environment. Make sure you review the [details](/azure/app-service/manage-backup?tabs=portal#automatic-vs-custom-backups) of this feature.

          
          You can select a custom backup and restore it to an App Service in your ASE v3. You must create the App Service you'll restore to before restoring the app. You can choose to restore the backup to the production slot, an existing slot, or a newly created slot that you can create during the restoration process.

          For more information, see [Migration alternatives, backup, and restore](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives#back-up-and-restore).

      - question:
          What will happen to my ASE v1/v2 resources after August 31, 2024?
        answer:
          After August 31, 2024, if you haven't migrated, your ASE v1/v2 and the apps deployed on them will no longer be available. ASE v1/v2 is hosted on App Service scale units running on [Cloud Services (classic)](/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me) architecture that will be [retired on August 31, 2024](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/cloud-services-retirement-announcement/). Because of this, [ASE v1/v2 will no longer be available after that date](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/app-service-environment-v1-and-v2-retirement-announcement/). Migrate to ASE v3 to keep your apps running or to save or back up any resources or data that you need to maintain.

      - question:
          What should I expect during the migration?
        answer:
          Migration consists of a series of steps that must be followed in order. Key points are given for a subset of the steps. It's important to understand what happens during these steps and how your environment and apps are impacted. These steps differ slightly depending on which migration feature you execute. For more information, see [Overview of the in-place migration process](/azure/app-service/environment/migrate?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Support#overview-of-the-migration-process-using-the-in-place-migration-feature) or [Overview of the side-by-side migration process](/azure/app-service/environment/side-by-side-migrate#overview-of-the-migration-process-using-the-side-by-side-migration-feature). After reviewing the process overview information, when you're ready to migrate, follow the guide for the migration process you're executing, either the [in-place migration guide](/azure/app-service/environment/how-to-migrate?pivots=experience-azp) or the [side-by-side migration guide](/azure/app-service/environment/how-to-side-by-side-migrate).

          
          Migration requires a 4 to 6-hour service window for ASE v2 to v3 migrations. Depending on the size of the environment migrating from v1 to v3, a service window up to six hours is required during migration, scaling, and environment configurations. When the migration is complete, the apps on the old ASE will run on the new ASE v3.

      - question:
          What if the migration fails or an unexpected issue occurs during the migration?
        answer:
          If an unexpected issue occurs, support teams are on hand. You should migrate development environments before touching any production environments to learn about the migration process and see how it impacts your workloads.

  - name: Common errors
    questions:
      - question:
          ASEv3 Migration isn't yet ready.
        answer:
          This error occurs because the underlying infrastructure isn't ready to support ASE v3. For more information about the migration tools and to review the migration path decision tree, see [What tooling is available to help with the upgrade to App Service Environment v3](/azure/app-service/environment/upgrade-to-asev3#what-tooling-is-available-to-help-with-the-upgrade-to-app-service-environment-v3)? If the migration tools aren't available for your situation and you want to migrate immediately, we recommend using one of the [manual migration options](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives).

      - question:
          Migration is invalid. Your ASE needs to be upgraded to the latest build to ensure successful migration.
        answer:
          This error occurs because your ASE isn't on the minimum build required for migration. 
          
          An upgrade will be started, and your ASE won't be impacted, but you won't be able to scale or change your ASE during the upgrade progress. You won't be able to migrate until the upgrade finishes. Build upgrades may take some time to complete. We recommend waiting until the upgrade finishes and before migrating.

      - question:
          Migrate can't be called on this ASE until the active upgrade has finished.
        answer:
          This error occurs because ASEs can't be migrated during platform upgrades. You can set your [upgrade preference](/azure/app-service/environment/how-to-upgrade-preference?pivots=experience-azp) from the Azure portal. In some cases, an upgrade is initiated when accessing the migration page if your ASE isn't on the current build.

      - question:
          ASE management operation in progress.
        answer:
          This error occurs because your ASE is undergoing a management operation. These operations can include activities such as deployments or upgrades. Migration is blocked until these operations are complete.
          Management operations may take some time to complete. We recommend waiting until these operations are complete before migrating.

      - question:
          Migrate can't be called if IP SSL is enabled on any of the sites.
        answer:
          This error occurs because your ASE has IP SSL-enabled sites that can't be migrated. ASE v3 doesn't support IP SSL. You must remove all IP SSL bindings before migrating using the migration features or one of the manual options. If you intend to use the migration tool, once you remove all IP SSL bindings and pass the validation check, you can proceed with the automated migration.

      - question:
          Your InternalLoadBalancingMode isn't currently supported.
        answer:
          This error occurs because ASEs that have `InternalLoadBalancingMode` set to specific values can't currently be migrated using the migration feature.
          
          We recommend migrating using one of the [manual migration options](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives) if you want to migrate immediately.

      - question:
          <ZoneRedundant><DedicatedHosts><ASEv3.ASE> isn't available in this location.
        answer:
          This error occurs if you try to migrate an ASE in a region that doesn't support one of your requested features.
          
          We recommend migrating using one of the [manual migration options](/azure/app-service/environment/migration-alternatives) if you want to migrate immediately. Otherwise, wait for the migration feature to support this ASE configuration.

      - question:
          Subscription has too many ASEs. Please remove some before trying to create more.
        answer:
          This error occurs because the ASE [quota for your subscription](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits) has been reached.
          
          We recommend removing unneeded environments or contacting support to review your options.

      - question:
          Migrate isn't available for this subscription.
        answer:
          We recommend opening a support case to resolve your issue.

      - question:
          Full migration can't be called before IP addresses are generated.
        answer:
          This error occurs if you try to migrate before finishing the pre-migration steps. We recommend that you ensure you have completed all pre-migration steps before you try to migrate. For more information, see the [step-by-step guide for migrating](/azure/app-service/environment/how-to-migrate?pivots=experience-azp).
