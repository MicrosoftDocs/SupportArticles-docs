# Container group deployment remains in Waiting state

This article discusses how to resolve a scenario in Microsoft Azure Container Instances in which a container group is unresponsive and doesn't exit the "Waiting" state.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy an image through a virtual network onto a private container instance, the deployment times out after 30 minutes and fails. Additionally, the container group deployment state is shown as **Waiting** in the Azure portal.

## Cause

Your firewall blocks access to port 19390. When container groups are deployed in virtual networks, port 19390 is required to connect to Container Instances from the Azure portal.

## Solution

Expand the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address range of the subnet by specifying a network mask of `/24` or smaller.

> [!NOTE]
> We don't recommend using small subnets to work around unsupported scenarios (such as simulating a fixed IP address for a private container instance by restricting DHCP to only a few IPs).
