# DeploymentFailed - InaccessibleImage error code

This article discusses how to resolve a deployment failure on Microsoft Azure Container Instances that generates an "InaccessibleImage" error code.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy a container instance, the deployment fails, and you receive an error message that resembles the following text:

> {
>
> > **"code":**"DeploymentFailed",  
> > **"message":**"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see <https://aka.ms/DeployOperations> for usage details.",  
> > **"details":**\[
> >
> > > {
> > >
> > > > **"code":**"InaccessibleImage",  
> > > > **"message":**"The image '\<container-registry-name>.azurecr.io/\<image-name>:\<version-name>' in container group '\<container-group-name>' is not accessible. Please check the image and registry credential."
> > >
> > > }
> >
> > \]
>
> }

## Cause

You're trying to use a service principal to access the Azure container registry. This scenario can occur because of one of the following reasons:

- You specified incorrect credentials when you tried to create the container instance.

- You specified the correct credentials, but the service calls on Container Instances are blocked by firewall rules in the Azure container registry.

## Solution

You must use a managed identity to allow the Container Instances trusted service to access the container registry. For more information, see [Allow trusted services to securely access a network-restricted container registry](/azure/container-registry/allow-access-trusted-services#about-trusted-services). You can also learn more at [Deploy to Azure Container Instances from Azure Container Registry using a managed identity](/azure/container-instances/using-azure-container-registry-mi).
