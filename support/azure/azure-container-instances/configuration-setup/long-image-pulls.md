# Image pull takes a long time to run

This article discusses what you can do if an image pull takes a long time to run on Microsoft Azure Container Instances.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Symptoms

- Container groups are stuck in a "Created" status for a significant amount of time.

- The image size that's used for the container group is large.

## Cause

In Container Instances, images aren't cached forever. If the image isn't cached, the image is pulled from the registry. A registry pull can take a long time if the image is large. This is expected behavior for large, uncached images.

If you need faster pull times, you might want to check whether one of the [listed cached images](/rest/api/container-instances/location/list-cached-images) would work successfully for your use case.

## Solution

Run the following [az container show](/cli/azure/container#az-container-show) command so that you can view the timeline of the container events:

```azurecli
az container show --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <container-group-name>
```

In this example, the `Pulling` image event begins at 16:30:51, and the successful `Pulled` event is recorded on the same day at 16:48:43. Therefore, the image pull takes almost 18 minutes to finish. You can use this information to determine whether the image pull time is expected or abnormal.
