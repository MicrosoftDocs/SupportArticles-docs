# "(ServiceUnavailable)... container group quota... exceeded in region" error

This article discusses how to resolve a ServiceUnavailable ("Resource type 'Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups' container group quota 'ContainerGroups' exceeded in region") error that occurs when you try to deploy multiple container groups in different regions in Microsoft Azure Container Instances.

## Symptoms

You receive the following error message:

> **Message**: Resource type 'Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups' container group quota 'ContainerGroups' exceeded in region '\<region>'. Limit: '0', Usage: '0' Requested: '1'.  
> **ERROR**: (ServiceUnavailable) Resource type 'Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups' container group quota 'ContainerGroups' exceeded in region '\<region>'.  
> **Limit**: '0',  
> **Usage**: '0'  
> **Requested**: '1'.  
> **Code**: ServiceUnavailable

## Cause

You try to simultaneously deploy multiple container groups in different regions that use the same name. This action triggers the fraud detection logic in Container Instances. Automation scripts that are run in the cloud might be trying to do this multi-deployment operation.

## Solution

To avoid this error, issue requests for container group deployments one at a time.
