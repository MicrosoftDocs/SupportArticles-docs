# Troubleshoot issues when you pull from Azure Container Registry

Pulling container images or artifacts from Azure Container Registry is a fundamental task for deploying applications. However, issues can occur that are related to permissions, networking, identity management, and other factors. This article discusses how to troubleshoot issues that occur when you try to pull container images or artifacts from Microsoft Azure Container Registry by using an Azure virtual machine (VM) or other device (such as a laptops or on-premises computer). It also contains links to common scenarios and errors, and their resolutions.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Troubleshooting checklist

### Step 1: Reproduce the issue

Reproduce the issue (for example, by running `docker pull <image-name>`) so that you can view the error message and other details.

### Step 2: Check container registry health

To view a report about the health of the container registry, run the following [az acr check-health](/cli/azure/acr#az-acr-check-health) command:

```azurecli
az acr check-health --name <container-registry-name> --ignore-errors --yes
```

If an issue is detected, the report displays an error code and a description. For more information about the errors and possible solutions, see [Health check error reference](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-health-error-reference).
