# Troubleshoot memory saturation in AKS clusters

This article discusses methods for troubleshooting memory saturation issues. Memory saturation occurs if at least one application or process needs more memory than a container host can provide, or if the host exhausts its available memory.

## Prerequisites

- The Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) command-line tool. To install kubectl by using [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), run the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

## Symptoms

The following table outlines the common symptoms of memory saturation.

| Symptom | Description |
|---|---|
| Unschedulable pods | Additional pods can't be scheduled if the node is close to its set memory limit. |
| Pod eviction | If a node is running out of memory, the kubelet can evict pods. Although the control plane tries to reschedule the evicted pods on other nodes that have resources, there's no guarantee that other nodes have sufficient memory to run these pods. |
| Node not ready | Memory saturation can cause `kubelet` and `containerd` to become unresponsive, eventually causing node readiness issues. |
| Out-of-memory (OOM) kill | An OOM problem occurs if the pod eviction can't prevent a node issue. |

## Troubleshooting checklist

To reduce memory saturation, use effective monitoring tools and apply best practices.

### Step 1: Identify nodes that have memory saturation

Use either of the following methods to identify nodes that have memory saturation:

- In a web browser, use the Container Insights feature of AKS in the Azure portal.

- In a console, use the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl).

### [Browser](#tab/browser)

Container Insights is a feature within AKS that monitors container workload performance. For more information, see [Enable Container insights for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/azure-monitor/containers/container-insights-enable-aks).

1. On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Kubernetes services**.
1. In the list of Kubernetes services, select the name of your cluster.
1. In the navigation pane of your cluster, find the **Monitoring** heading, and then select **Insights**.
1. Set the appropriate **Time Range** value.
1. Select the **Nodes** tab.
1. In the **Metric** list, select **Memory working set (computed from Allocatable)**.
1. In the percentiles selector, set the sample to **Max**, and then select the **Max %** column label two times. This action sorts the table nodes by the maximum percentage of memory used, from highest to lowest.

      The Azure portal screenshot shows a table of nodes. The table column values include **Name**, **Status**, **Max %** (the percentage of memory capacity that's used), **Max** (memory usage), **Containers**, **UpTime**, **Controller**, and **Trend Max % (1 bar = 15m)**. The nodes have an expand/collapse arrow icon next to their names.

      There are four rows in the table, and they represent four nodes in an AKS agent pool virtual machine scale set. The statuses are all **Ok**, the maximum percentage of memory used is from 64 to 58 percent, the maximum memory used is from 2.6 GB to 2.86 GB, the number of containers used is 20 to 24, and the uptime spans 6 to 15 days. No controllers are listed.
   :::image-end:::

1. Because the first node has the highest memory usage, select that node to investigate the memory usage of the pods that are running on the node.

   :::image type="complex" source="./media/identify-memory-saturation-aks/containers-containerinsights-memorypressure.png" alt-text="Azure portal screenshot of a node's containers under the Nodes view in Container Insights within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster." lightbox="./media/identify-memory-saturation-aks/containers-containerinsights-memorypressure.png":::
      The Azure portal screenshot shows a table of nodes, and the first node is expanded to display an **Other processes** heading and a sublist of processes that are running within the first node. As for the nodes themselves, the table column values for the processes include **Name**, **Status**, **Max %** (the percentage of memory capacity that's used), **Max** (memory usage), **Containers**, **UpTime**, **Controller**, and **Trend Max % (1 bar = 15m)**. The processes also have an expand/collapse arrow icon next to their names.
      Nine processes are listed under the node. The statuses are all **Ok**, the maximum percentage of memory used for the processes ranges from 16 to 0.3 percent, the maximum memory used is from 0.7 mc to 22 mc, the number of containers used is 1 to 3, and the uptime is 3 to 4 days. Unlike for the node, the processes all have a corresponding controller listed. In this screenshot, the controller names are prefixes of the process names, and they're hyperlinked.
   :::image-end:::

    > [!NOTE]
    > The percentage of CPU or memory usage for pods is based on the CPU request specified for the container. It doesn't represent the percentage of the CPU or memory usage for the node. So, look at the actual CPU or memory usage rather than the percentage of CPU or memory usage for pods.

### [Command Line](#tab/command-line)

This procedure uses the kubectl commands in a console. It displays only the current state of the nodes.

1. Get the memory usage of the nodes by running the [kubectl top node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-node-em-) command:

   ```bash
   kubectl top node
   ```

   The output of this command resembles the following text:

   ```output
   NAME                                 CPU(cores)   CPU%   MEMORY(bytes)   MEMORY%
   aks-agentpool-30486455-vmss000003    239m         12%    3148Mi          69%
   aks-agentpool-30486455-vmss000005    326m         17%    2143Mi          46%
   aks-testmemory-30616462-vmss000000   66m          3%     1532Mi          28%
   aks-testmemory-30616462-vmss000001   90m          4%     1689Mi          31%
   aks-testmemory-30616462-vmss000002   74m          3%     1715Mi          31%
   ```

1. Get the list of pods that are running on the node and their memory usage by running the [kubectl get pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) and [kubectl top pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#-em-pod-em-) commands: 

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --output wide \
       | grep <node-name> \
       | awk '{print $1" "$2}' \
       | xargs -n2 kubectl top pods --namespace \
       | awk 'NR==1 || NR%2==0' \
       | sort -k3n \
       | column -t
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > In this code snippet, replace <_node-name_> with the actual node name.

   The output of the code snippet resembles the following text:

   ```output
   NAME                                 CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)

   ama-logs-w5bmd                       12m          403Mi
   ```

1. Review the requests and limits for each pod on the node by running the [kubectl describe node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#describe) command:

   ```bash
   kubectl describe node <node-name>
   ```

   The output of this command resembles the following text:

   ```output

Now that you've identified the pods that are using high memory, you can identify the applications that are running on the pod.

### Step 2: Review best practices to avoid memory saturation

Review the following table to learn how to implement best practices for avoiding memory saturation.

| Best practice | Description |
|---|---|
| Use memory [requests and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#requests-and-limits) | Kubernetes provides options to specify the minimum memory size (*request*) and the maximum memory size (*limit*) for a container. By configuring limits on pods, you can avoid memory pressure on the node. Make sure that the aggregate limits for all pods that are running doesn't exceed the node's available memory. This situation is called *overcommitting*. The Kubernetes scheduler allocates resources based on set requests and limits through [Quality of Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/) (QoS). Without appropriate limits, the scheduler might schedule too many pods on a single node. This might eventually bring down the node. Additionally, while the kubelet is evicting pods, it prioritizes pods in which the memory usage exceeds their defined requests. We recommend that you set the memory request close to the actual usage. |
| Enable the [horizontal pod autoscaler](/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-scale?tabs=azure-cli#autoscale-pods) | By scaling the cluster, you can balance the requests across many pods to prevent memory saturation. This technique can reduce the memory footprint on the specific node. |
| Use [anti-affinity tags](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity) | For scenarios in which memory is unbounded by design, you can use node selectors and affinity or anti-affinity tags, which can isolate the workload to specific nodes. By using anti-affinity tags, you can prevent other workloads from scheduling pods on these nodes. This reduces the memory saturation problem. |
| Choose [higher SKU VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/) | Virtual machines (VMs) that have more random-access memory (RAM) are better suited to handle high memory usage. To use this option, you must create a new node pool, cordon the nodes (make them unschedulable), and drain the existing node pool. |
| Isolate [system and user workloads](/azure/aks/use-system-pools#system-and-user-node-pools) | We recommend that you run your applications on a user node pool. This configuration makes sure that you can isolate the Kubernetes-specific pods to the system node pool and maintain the cluster performance. |
