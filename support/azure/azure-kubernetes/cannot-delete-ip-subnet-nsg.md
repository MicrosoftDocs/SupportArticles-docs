# Troubleshoot the PublicIPAddressCannotBeDeleted, InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted, or InUseNetworkSecurityGroupCannotBeDeleted error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `PublicIPAddressCannotBeDeleted`, `InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted`, or `InUseNetworkSecurityGroupCannotBeDeleted` error that occurs when you try to delete a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to delete an AKS cluster, you receive one of the following error messages:

- For the `PublicIPAddressCannotBeDeleted` error code:

  > {
  >
  > message: "Public IP address ...../providers/Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/ can not be deleted since it is still allocated to resource ...../providers/Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/kubernetes/frontendIPConfigurations/..... . In order to delete the public IP, disassociate/detach the Public IP address from the resource."
  >
  > }

- For the `InUseSubnetCannotBeDeleted` error code:

  > {
  >
  > message: "Subnet aks-subnet is in use by …../Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/|providers|Microsoft.Compute|virtualMachineScaleSets|vmss|virtualMachines|1|networkInterfaces|aks-worker-vmss/ipConfigurations/ipconfig1 and cannot be deleted. In order to delete the subnet, delete all the resources within the subnet."
  >
  > }

- For the `InUseNetworkSecurityGroupCannotBeDeleted` error code:

  > {
  >
  > message: "Network security group …../Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/test cannot be deleted because it is in use by the following resources: ...../Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/test/subnets/test. In order to delete the Network security group, remove the association with the resource(s)."
  >
  > }

## Cause

The AKS cluster is associated with a subnet, network security group (NSG), or specific public IP address that's currently being used. This association prevents you from deleting the cluster.

## Solution

- Remove all public IP addresses that are associated with Azure Load Balancer and the resource that's used by the subnet. For more information, see [View, modify settings for, or delete a public IP address](/azure/virtual-network/ip-services/virtual-network-public-ip-address#view-modify-settings-for-or-delete-a-public-ip-address).

- In the load balancer, remove the rules for **Load Balance rules**, **Health probes**, and **Backend pools**.

- For the NSG and subnet, remove all associated rules. For more information, see [Associate or dissociate a network security group to or from a subnet or network interface](/azure/virtual-network/manage-network-security-group#associate-or-dissociate-a-network-security-group-to-or-from-a-subnet-or-network-interface).
