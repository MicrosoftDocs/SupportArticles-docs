# Cluster autoscaler fails to scale with "cannot scale cluster autoscaler enabled node pool" error

This article discusses how to resolve the "cannot scale cluster autoscaler enabled node pool" error that appears when scaling a cluster with an autoscaler enabled node pool.

## Symptoms

You receive an error message that resembles the following message:

> `kubectl get nodes` outputs "No resources found"  
> All pods state is `Pending`  
> Scale operations are failing with "Cannot scale cluster autoscaler enabled node pool" error

## Troubleshooting checklist

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) uses virtual machine scale sets-based agent pools, which contain cluster nodes and [cluster autoscaling capabilities](/azure/aks/cluster-autoscaler) if enabled.

### Check that the cluster virtual machine scale set exists

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Find the node resource group by searching the following names:

   - The default name `MC_{AksResourceGroupName}_{YourAksClusterName}_{AksResourceLocation}`.
   - The custom name (if it was provided at creation).

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you create a new cluster, AKS automatically creates a second resource group to store the AKS resources. For more information, see [Why are two resource groups created with AKS?](/azure/aks/faq#why-are-two-resource-groups-created-with-aks)

1. Check the list of resources and make sure that there's a virtual machine scale set.

## Cause 1: The cluster virtual machine scale set was deleted

Deleting the virtual machine scale set attached to the cluster causes the cluster autoscaler to fail. It also causes issues when provisioning resources such as nodes and pods.

> [!NOTE]
> Modifying any resource under the node resource group in the AKS cluster is an unsupported action and will cause cluster operation failures. You can prevent changes from being made to the node resource group by [blocking users from modifying resources](/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#fully-managed-resource-group-preview) managed by the AKS cluster.

## Cause 2: Tags or any other properties were modified from the node resource group

You may receive scaling errors if you modify or delete Azure-created tags and other resource properties in the node resource group. For more information, see [Can I modify tags and other properties of the AKS resources in the node resource group?](/azure/aks/faq#can-i-modify-tags-and-other-properties-of-the-aks-resources-in-the-node-resource-group)

## Cause 3: The cluster node resource group was deleted

Deleting the node resource group causes the cluster autoscaler to fail. In general, deleting this resource group causes issues when provisioning the infrastructure resources required by the cluster.

## Solution: Update the cluster to the goal state without changing the configuration

To resolve this issue, you can run the following command to recover the deleted virtual machine scale set or any tags (missing or modified):

> [!NOTE]
> It might take a few minutes until the operation completes.

```azurecli
az aks update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-cluster-name>
```
