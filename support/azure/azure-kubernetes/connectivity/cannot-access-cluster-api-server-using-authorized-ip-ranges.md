# Can't access the cluster API server when using authorized IP ranges

This article discusses how to resolve a scenario in which you can't use authorized IP address ranges to access the API server for a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

If you try to create or manage an AKS cluster, you can't access the cluster API server.

## Cause

You configured your AKS cluster to access the cluster API server by using authorized IP address ranges that your computer can't access.

## Solution

Make sure that when you run the [az aks create](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-create) or [az aks update](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-update) command in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), the `--api-server-authorized-ip-ranges` parameter includes the IP addresses or IP address ranges of the automation, development, or tooling systems that are being used.
