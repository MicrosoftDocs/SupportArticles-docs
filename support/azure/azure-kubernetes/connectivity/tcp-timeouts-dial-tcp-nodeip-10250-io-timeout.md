#Customer intent: As an Azure Kubernetes user, I want to troubleshoot why I'm receiving TCP timeouts (such as 'dial tcp <Node_IP>:10250: i/o timeout') so that I can use my Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster successfully.

# 10250 I/O timeouts error when running kubectl log command

TCP timeouts can be caused by blockages of internal traffic that runs between nodes. To investigate TCP time-outs, verify that this traffic isn't being blocked, for example, by [network security groups](/azure/aks/concepts-security#azure-network-security-groups) (NSGs) on the subnet for your cluster nodes.

## Connect to the cluster

First, connect to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster by running the following command:

```bash
export RESOURCE_GROUP=<your-resource-group>
export CLUSTER_NAME=<your-cluster-name>

az aks get-credentials --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTER_NAME
```

## Symptoms

Tunnel functionalities, such as `kubectl logs` and code execution, work only for pods that are hosted on nodes on which tunnel service pods are deployed. Pods on other nodes that have no tunnel service pods cannot reach to the tunnel. When viewing the logs of these pods, you receive the following error message:

```bash
kubectl logs $POD_NAME
```

Results:

<!-- expected_similarity=0.3 -->

```output
Error from server: Get "https://aks-agentpool-xxxxxxxxx-vmssxxxxxxxxx:10250/containerLogs/vsm-mba-prod/mba-api-app-xxxxxxxxxx/technosvc": dial tcp <IP-Address>:10250: i/o timeout
```

## Solution

To resolve this issue, allow traffic on port 10250 as described in this [article](tunnel-connectivity-issues.md).
