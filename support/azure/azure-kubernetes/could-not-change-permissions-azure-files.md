# "Could not change permissions" error while using Azure Files

This article discusses how to troubleshoot a "could not change permissions" error when you use Microsoft Azure Files with your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you run PostgreSQL on the Azure Files plug-in, you receive an error that resembles the following output:

> initdb: could not change permissions of directory "/var/lib/postgresql/data": Operation not permitted
>
> fixing permissions on existing directory /var/lib/postgresql/data

## Cause

The Azure Files plug-in uses the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol, which is a dialect of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. When this protocol is in use, the file and directory permissions can't be changed after the files and directories are mounted.

## Workaround

Use the Azure Disk plug-in instead, and [use the subPath property](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#using-subpath).

> [!NOTE]
> For the ext3 or ext4 disk type, there's a *lost+found* directory after the disk is formatted.
