# Troubleshoot the Throttled error code (429)

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `Throttled` error (status 429) that occurs when you try to create and deploy a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to create an AKS cluster, you receive the following "The PutManagedClusterHandler.PUT request limit has been exceeded" error message that shows a "SubCode" value of **Throttled** and a "Status" value of **429**:

> Category: ClientError;
>
> SubCode: Throttled;
>
> OrginalError: autorest/azure: Service returned an error. **Status=429**
>
> **Code="Throttled"**
>
> Message="> The PutManagedClusterHandler.PUT request limit has been exceeded for SubID='*\<subscription-id-guid>*', please retry again in X seconds. For more information, please visit aka.ms/aks/throttling";
Request throttling can occur on various Azure components, so the error message might be different depending on the type of resource where this issue occurs.

Resource provider throttling is independent of ARM throttling and is tailored to the operations of a specific resource provider. In this scenario, AKS resource provider throttling is specific to the AKS resource provider and applies only to operations related to AKS resources.

## Cause

AKS requests are throttled. For information about how AKS limits work and the specific limits per hour, see [Throttling limits on AKS resource provider APIs](/azure/aks/quotas-skus-regions#throttling-limits-on-aks-resource-provider-apis).

## Solution

To resolve this issue, examine and modify your access pattern of the throttled subscription. The following table lists the possible access patterns and corresponding solutions.

| Access pattern | Solution |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Automated scripts constantly run LIST operations against managedCluster resources. | Run the scripts less frequently. |
| Users attempt to deploy multiple AKS clusters in a short period of time. | Space out deployments or use different subscriptions.|
| Users attempt to modify the same AKS cluster multiple times consecutively. | Space out operations. Ensure successful completion before initiating another one.|
| Users attempt to add, modify, or delete one or more agentPools on the same AKS cluster. | Space out operations. Ensure successful completion before initiating another one. |
