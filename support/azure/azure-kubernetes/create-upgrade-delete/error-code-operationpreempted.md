# AKSOperationPreempted or AKSOperationPreemptedByDelete error when performing a new operation

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `AKSOperationPreempted` or `AKSOperationPreemptedByDelete` error that might occur when you try to perform a new operation but it has been preempted by another operation on a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to perform a new operation on an AKS cluster, you receive one of the following error messages:

- > Code: "AKSOperationPreempted"
  > 
  > Message: "This operation has been preempted by another operation with ID \<operation ID\>"


- > Code: "AKSOperationPreemptedByDelete"
  > 
  > Message: "This operation has been preempted by Deleting operation."

## Cause

This error usually occurs when an in-progress operation is interrupted by a subsequent operation that was issued before the in-progress operation is finished. The error will indicate the subsequent operation, which can be a delete or any other operation.

## Solution

Retry the operation after the in-progress operation finishes or abort the long-running operation.
