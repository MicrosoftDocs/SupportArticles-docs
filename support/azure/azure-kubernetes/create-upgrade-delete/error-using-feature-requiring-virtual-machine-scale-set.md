# Errors using features that require virtual machine scale sets

This article discusses how to troubleshoot errors that occur when you try to use a feature that requires virtual machine scale sets on a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

You receive the following error message:

> AgentPool \<agentpoolname> has set auto scaling as enabled but isn't on Virtual Machine Scale Sets

## Cause

Features such as the cluster autoscaler or multiple node pools require virtual machine scale sets as the `vm-set-type`.

## Solution

To successfully create an AKS cluster that uses the required scale set features, follow the steps in the "Before you begin" section of the appropriate article:
