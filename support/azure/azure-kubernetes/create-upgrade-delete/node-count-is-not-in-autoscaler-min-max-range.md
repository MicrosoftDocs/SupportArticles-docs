#Customer intent: As an Azure Kubernetes user, I want to troubleshoot why the current node count isn't in the autoscaler "min" and "max" range so that I can successfully resume my Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster after a stop operation.

# Current node count is outside the autoscaler min and max range

## Symptoms

You're using the autoscaler for a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. When you restart your cluster, your current node count doesn't fall within the minimum and maximum range of values that you set.

## Cause

This behavior is expected. The cluster starts by setting the number of nodes that it needs to run its workloads. These values aren't affected by your autoscaler settings. When your cluster does scaling operations, the minimum and maximum values will affect your current node count.

For more information about this behavior, see [My cluster is below minimum / above maximum number of nodes, but CA did not fix that! Why?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#my-cluster-is-below-minimum--above-maximum-number-of-nodes-but-ca-did-not-fix-that-why)

## More information

Your cluster will eventually enter and remain in the desired range until you stop the cluster.
