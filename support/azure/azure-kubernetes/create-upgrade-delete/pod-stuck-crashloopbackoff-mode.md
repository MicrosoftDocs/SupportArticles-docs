# Pod is stuck in CrashLoopBackOff mode

If a pod has a `CrashLoopBackOff` status, then the pod probably failed or exited unexpectedly, and the log contains an exit code that isn't zero. There are several possible reasons why your pod is stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff` mode. Consider the following options and their associated [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands) commands.

| Option | kubectl command |
|--|--|
| [Debug the pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-application/#debugging-pods) itself | `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` |
| [Debug the replication controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-pods/#debugging-replication-controllers) | `kubectl describe replicationcontroller <controller-name>` |
| [Read the termination message](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/determine-reason-pod-failure/#writing-and-reading-a-termination-message) | `kubectl get pod <pod-name> --output=yaml` |
| [Examine the logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging/) | `kubectl logs <pod-name>` |

> [!NOTE]  
> A pod can also have a `CrashLoopBackOff` status if it has finished deployment, but it's configured to keep restarting even if the exit code is zero. For example, if you deploy a busybox image without specifying any arguments, the image starts, runs, finishes, and then restarts in a loop:
>
> ```console
> $ kubectl run nginx --image nginx
> pod/nginx created
> 
> $ kubectl run busybox --image busybox
> pod/busybox created
> 
> $ kubectl get pods --watch
> NAME     READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE

If you don't recognize the issue after you create more pods on the node, then run a pod on a single node to determine how many resources the pod actually uses.
