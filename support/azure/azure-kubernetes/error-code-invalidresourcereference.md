# Troubleshoot the InvalidResourceReference error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `InvalidResourceReference` error that occurs when you try to create and deploy a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to create an AKS cluster, you receive the following error message:

> Code="InvalidResourceReference"
>
> Message="Resource /subscriptions/*\<subscription-id-guid>*/resourceGroups/MyResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/vnet-otcom/subnets/Subnet-AKS referenced by resource /subscriptions/*\<subscription-id-guid>*/resourceGroups/MC_MyResourceGroup_MyCluster-AKS_JAPANEAST/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/aks-nodepool1-13686447-vmss was not found. Please make sure that the referenced resource exists, and that both resources are in the same region."
>
> Details=[]

## Cause

A mismatch exists between resources in different regions. In the example in the "Symptoms" section, the virtual network and the virtual machine scale set aren't in the same region. Because the resources are in different regions, it's impossible to create the scale set instance.

## Solution

Review the resources to make sure that they're in the same region. In this example, either modify the region that the AKS cluster is being built in, or create a new virtual network in the same region.
