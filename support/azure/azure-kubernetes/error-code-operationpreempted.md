# Troubleshoot the OperationPreempted error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `OperationPreempted` error that might occur when you try to create and deploy a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy an AKS cluster, you receive the following error message:

> This operation has been preempted by Deleting operation.

## Cause

This error usually occurs when an in-progress create operation is interrupted by a subsequent delete operation that was issued before the create cluster operation is finished.

## Solution

Retry the operation after the delete operation finishes.
