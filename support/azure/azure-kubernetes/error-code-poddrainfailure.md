#Customer intent: As an Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) user, I want to troubleshoot an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster upgrade that failed because of eviction failures caused by Pod Disruption Budgets so that I can upgrade the cluster successfully.

# Troubleshoot UpgradeFailed errors due to eviction failures caused by PDBs

This article discusses how to identify and resolve UpgradeFailed errors due to eviction failures caused by Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) that occur when you try to upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Prerequisites

This article requires Azure CLI version 2.0.65 or a later version. To find the version number, run `az --version`. If you have to install or upgrade Azure CLI, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

For more detailed information about the upgrade process, see the "Upgrade an AKS cluster" section in [Upgrade an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster#upgrade-an-aks-cluster).

## Symptoms

An AKS cluster upgrade operation fails with the following error message:

> Code: UpgradeFailed  
> Message: Drain node \<node-name> failed when evicting pod \<pod-name>. Eviction failed with Too many Requests error. This is often caused by a restrictive Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) policy. See `http://aka.ms/aks/debugdrainfailures`. Original error: API call to Kubernetes API Server failed.

## Cause

This error might occur if a pod is protected by the Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) policy. In this situation, the pod resists being drained.

To test this situation, run `kubectl get pdb -A`, and then check the **Allowed Disruption** value. The value should be **1** or greater. For more information, see [Plan for availability using pod disruption budgets](/azure/aks/operator-best-practices-scheduler#plan-for-availability-using-pod-disruption-budgets).

If the **Allowed Disruption** value is **0**, the node drain will fail during the upgrade process.

To resolve this issue, use one of the following solutions.

## Solution 1: Enable pods to drain

1. Adjust the PDB to enable pod draining. Generally, The allowed disruption is controlled by the `Min Available / Max unavailable` or `Running pods / Replicas` parameter. You can modify the `Min Available / Max unavailable` parameter at the PDB level or increase the number of `Running pods / Replicas` to push the Allowed Disruption value to **1** or greater.
2. Try again to upgrade the AKS cluster to the same version that you tried to upgrade to previously. This process will trigger a reconciliation.

## Solution 2: Back up, delete, and redeploy the PDB

1. Take a backup of the PDB `kubectl get pdb <pdb-name> -n <pdb-namespace> -o yaml > pdb_backup.yaml`, and then delete the PDB `kubectl delete pdb <pdb-name> -n /<pdb-namespace>`. After the upgrade is finished, you can redeploy the PDB `kubectl apply -f pdb_backup.yaml`.
2. Try again to upgrade the AKS cluster to the same version that you tried to upgrade to previously. This process will trigger a reconciliation.

## Solution 3: Delete the pods that can't be drained

1. Delete the pods that can't be drained.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > If the pods were created by a deployment or StatefulSet, they'll be controlled by a ReplicaSet. If that's the case, you might have to delete the deployment or StatefulSet. Before you do that, we recommend that you make a backup: `kubectl get <kubernetes-object> <name> -n <namespace> -o yaml > backup.yaml`.

2. Try again to upgrade the AKS cluster to the same version that you tried to upgrade to previously. This process will trigger a reconciliation.
