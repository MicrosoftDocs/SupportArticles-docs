# Troubleshoot the RequestDisallowedByPolicy error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `RequestDisallowedByPolicy` error that occurs when you try to create and deploy a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy an AKS cluster, you receive the following error message:

> Resource request failed due to RequestDisallowedByPolicy. Please see <https://aka.ms/aks-requestdisallowedbypolicy> for more details. The detailed error message: Code="RequestDisallowedByPolicy"
>
> **Message="Resource 'MC_clustername' was disallowed by policy.**

## Cause

For security or compliance, your subscription administrators might assign policies that limit how resources are deployed. For example, your subscription might have a policy that prevents creating public IP addresses, network security groups, user-defined routes, or route tables. The error message includes the specific reason why the cluster creation was blocked.

## Solution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Find the policy that blocks the action. These policies are listed in the error message.

1. If possible, change your deployment to meet the limitations of the policy, and then retry the deploy operation.

1. Add an [exception to the policy](/azure/governance/policy/concepts/exemption-structure).

1. [Disable the policy](/azure/defender-for-cloud/tutorial-security-policy#disable-security-policies-and-disable-recommendations).

To get details about the policy that blocked your cluster deployment operation, see [RequestDisallowedByPolicy error with Azure resource policy](/azure/azure-resource-manager/troubleshooting/error-policy-requestdisallowedbypolicy).
