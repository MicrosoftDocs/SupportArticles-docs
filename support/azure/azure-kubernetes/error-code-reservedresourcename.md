# Troubleshoot the ReservedResourceName error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the `ReservedResourceName` error that occurs when you try to create and deploy a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy an AKS cluster, you receive the following error message:

> Either resource name or resource group name is using an Azure reserved name. Check details: autorest/azure: Service returned an error.
>
> Status=400 Code="ReservedResourceName"
>
> Message="**The resource name 'omsagent-aks-dev-microsoft' or a part of the name is a trademarked or reserved word.**".

## Cause

The resource name that was used to create the cluster or resource group is marked as a trademarked or reserved word.

## Solution
