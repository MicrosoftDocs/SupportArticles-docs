# Troubleshoot the "AvailabilityZoneNotSupported" error code

This article discusses how to identify and resolve the "AvailabilityZoneNotSupported" error that occurs when you try to create an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

Here's an example of the error message:

> Preflight validation check for resource(s) for container service xxxx in resource group zzzz failed. Message: The zone(s) '1' for resource 'agentpoolName' is not supported.The supported zones for location 'xyz' are 'A', 'B'

## Prerequisites
az rest command

## Symptoms

An AKS cluster create fails in requested availability zones, and you receive a "AvailabilityZoneNotSupported" error message.

## Cause

The issue occurs if the requested sku is not available in any of the requested zones. 

## Solution

you can use the following command to verify if sku is not available in requested zones

`az rest --method get  \
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/providers/Microsoft.Compute/skus?%24filter=location+eq+%27<location>%27&api-version=2022-03-01"  >> availableSkus.txt`

You can then search for the requested sku info in availableSkus.txt

is you see something like this, your subscription doesnt have access to zones in the requested region

```
"restrictions": [
                {
                    "type": "Zone",
                    "values": [
                        "xxxxx"
                    ],
                    "restrictionInfo": {
                        "locations": [
                            "xxxxx"
                        ],
                        "zones": [
                            "1",
                            "2",
                            "3"
                        ]
                    },
                    "reasonCode": "NotAvailableForSubscription"
                }
            ]
```
