# Troubleshoot the VirtualNetworkNotInSucceededState error code

## Symptoms

When you create, upgrade, or scale an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster or node pool, the deployment fails and returns an error message that resembles the following message:

*Status=400 Code=\"VirtualNetworkNotInSucceededState\"*

*Message=\"Set virtual network ownership failed. Subscription: \<SUBSCRIPTION\>; resource group: \<RESOURCE GROUP\>; virtual network name: \<VNET NAME\>. autorest/azure: Service returned an error.
Status=400 Code=\"VirtualNetworkNotInSucceededState\" Message=\"Virtual network /subscriptions/\<SUBSCRIPTION\>/resourceGroups/\<RESOURCE
GROUP\>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/\<VNET\> is in Updating state. It needs to be in Succeeded state in order to set resource ownership.*

## Cause

AKS can set ownership on a virtual network only if the `provisioningState` of the VNet is **Succeeded**. The request fails if the VNet is in the **Updating**, **Deleting**, or **Failed** state. Common causes for this condition include:

- Another create, update, or delete operation is still running on the VNet.

- A previous network operation failed and left the VNet in the **Failed** state.

- Multiple parallel cluster or node pool deployments are trying to modify the same VNet at the same time.

## Resolution

Check the current provisioning state of the VNet:

```dotnetcli
az network vnet show -g \<resource-group\> -n \<vnet-name\> \--query \"provisioningState\" -o tsv
```

If the command returns **Succeeded**, the VNet is fully set up and ready for use, and you can retry your AKS operation. If it returns any other value, the VNet might be in a failed or pending state that requires manual intervention.
