# Breaking changes in Event-driven Autoscaling add-ons 2.15 and 2.14

This article explores the key breaking changes that are introduced in Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-ons 2.15 and 2.14. It also provides information about how to prepare your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters for these updates.

## Breaking changes in KEDA 2.15 and 2.14

Your AKS cluster Kubernetes version determines which KEDA version will be installed on your AKS cluster. For AKS clusters that are running Kubernetes version 1.30, KEDA add-on version 2.14 is installed. The upcoming release of Kubernetes 1.31 on Azure will ship together with KEDA add-on version 2.15.

### KEDA 2.15

- [Removal of pod-managed identities support](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/5035). 
    
    If you're using pod-managed identities, we recommend that you migrate to [workload identity for authentication](/azure/aks/keda-workload-identity).

### KEDA 2.14

- [Removal of Azure Data Explorer 'metadata.clientSecret' as it wasn't safe for managing secrets](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4514). 

    To ensure safe handling of secrets, use `clientSecretFromEnv` instead.
- [Removal of the deprecated `metricName` from trigger metadata section](https://github.com/kedacore/keda/issues/4240).

    The two affected Azure Scalers are **Azure Blob Scaler** and **Azure Log Analytics Scaler**. If you're using `metricName`, move `metricName` to outside the trigger metadata section to `trigger.name` in the trigger section to optionally name your trigger. The following examples show how to update configuration.

     Example before KEDA 2.14

     ```yaml
     triggers:
     - type: any-type
       metadata:
         metricName: "my-custom-name"
     ```

     Example by using KEDA 2.15 or 2.14

     ```yaml
     triggers:
     - type: any-type
       name: "my-custom-name"
       metadata:
     ```

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I determine whether my cluster is affected?

To determine whether your cluster is affected by the recent KEDA upgrades, follow these steps:

1. Identify the Kubernetes version of your AKS cluster. 

    Clusters that are running Kubernetes versions 1.30 or later will be affected by the KEDA upgrades (2.15 or 2.14). If you're on version 1.29 or earlier, these updates will not affect you. However, if you plan to upgrade your AKS cluster to Kubernetes version 1.30 or 1.31, make sure to review the changes and prepare accordingly before you upgrade.
     
    To check the cluster version, run the following the Azure CLI command:

     ```
     az aks show --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name <your-cluster-name> --query kubernetesVersion
     ```
   Example of the output:
      
    ```output
    "1.30"
    ```
2. Review the configurations of KEDA Scalers that are currently deployed in your cluster. Check whether Microsoft Entra pod-managed Identities are used for authentication. The following command displays output only if you're using Pod Identity together with KEDA:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get TriggerAuthentication --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.spec.podIdentity.provider=="azure")]}{.metadata.namespace}{"/"}{.metadata.name}{"\n"}{end}'
    ```
    Example of the output:
    ```output
    NAME                      PODIDENTITY                 SECRET                 ENV            VAULTADDRESS  
    keda-trigger-auth-azure     yourPodIdentity    azure-secret                                  <URL>
    ```
### What steps can I take to mitigate the issues?

1. Migrate from Microsoft Entra pod-managed identities to workload identity for authentication. For more information, see [Use Microsoft Entra Workload ID with AKS](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview?tabs=dotnet) and [Migrate from pod managed-identity to workload identity](/azure/aks/workload-identity-migrate-from-pod-identity).
2. Update Scaler Configurations to align with the new configuration requirements:

    - For **Azure Data Explorer Scaler**, replace `metadata.clientSecret` with `clientSecretFromEnv`. For more information about the `clientSecretFromEnv` definition, see  [Trigger Specifications](https://keda.sh/docs/2.15/scalers/azure-data-explorer/).
    - For **Azure Blob Scaler** and **Azure Log Analytics Scaler**, move `trigger.metadata.metricName` to `trigger.name`.

3. Test changes in a nonproduction environment. Deploy the updated configurations in a staging or development environment to make sure that they work correctly and don't affect your applications.
4. Monitor logs and alerts. After you make changes, monitor the cluster logs for any warnings or errors that are related to the new KEDA configuration and behavior.
