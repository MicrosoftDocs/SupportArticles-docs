# AKS upgrade fails when using an Azure custom policy

This article discusses how to resolve a scenario in which a Kubernetes upgrade fails when you use the Microsoft Azure Policy Add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Symptoms

You see a message in the Azure portal that indicates that your AKS cluster is compliant with your Azure custom policy. However, when you try to upgrade AKS, the custom policy blocks the upgrade attempt.

## Cause

During an AKS upgrade, the policies that are defined for the upgrade might differ from the policies that are defined for a running cluster. This scenario can create policy-related issues that appear only during the upgrade process. The scenario might occur if you start the upgrade process by using Azure CLI.

## Solution

Try using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) instead of Azure CLI to start the upgrade.
