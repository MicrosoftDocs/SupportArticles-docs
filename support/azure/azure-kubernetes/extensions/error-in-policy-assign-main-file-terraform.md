# "Policy definition not found" during policy assignments in Terraform

This article provides a solution to the "Policy definition not found" error that you encounter during policy assignments when you use the Terraform tool.

## Symptoms

When you try to run the following policy assignments that are configured in the *Main.tf* file of the Terraform tool, you receive the "Policy definition not found" error message:

```
resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "kubernetes" {
  name                 = "kubernetes"
  scope                = <scope>
  policy_definition_id = <policy_definition_id>
  description          = "Assignment of the Kubernetes to subscription."
  display_name         = "Kubernetes-custom-initiative-test01"
}
```

## Cause

The error occurs if the policy assignment references the policy initiative definition that's provided for the `policy_definition_id` argument. However, the `azurerm_policy_set_definition` module might be delayed or not found before the policy assignment is created.

## Solution

In your Terraform configuration, include a `depends_on` parameter within the policy assignment resource, as shown the following example. This value makes sure that the policy assignment is generated only after the creation of the policy set definition. 

```
resource "azurerm_policy_assignment" "kubernetes" {
  name                 = "kubernetes"
  scope                = <scope>
  policy_definition_id = <policy_definition_id>
  description          = "Assignment of the Kubernetes to subscription."
  display_name         = "Kubernetes-custom-initiative-test01"
  depends_on = [azurerm_policy_definition.policies]
}
```
