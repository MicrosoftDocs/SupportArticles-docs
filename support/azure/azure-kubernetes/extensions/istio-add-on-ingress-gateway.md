# Istio service mesh add-on ingress gateway troubleshooting

This article discusses how to troubleshoot [ingress gateway](/azure/aks/istio-deploy-ingress) issues on the Istio service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The Istio ingress gateway is an [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io)-based reverse proxy that you can use to route incoming traffic to workloads in the mesh.

For the Istio-based service mesh add-on, we offer the following ingress gateway options:

- An internal ingress gateway that uses a private IP address.

- An external ingress gateway that uses a publicly accessible IP address.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft doesn't support customizing the IP address for either the internal or external ingress gateways. Any IP customization changes to the Istio service mesh add-on will be reverted.

The add-on deploys Istio ingress gateway pods and deployments per revision. If you're doing a [canary upgrade](./istio-add-on-minor-revision-upgrade.md) and have two control plane revisions installed in your cluster, then you might have to troubleshoot multiple ingress gateway pods across both revisions.

## Troubleshooting checklist

### Step 1: Make sure no firewall or NSG rules block the ingress gateway

Verify that you don't have firewall or [Network Security Group (NSG) rules](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) that block traffic to the ingress gateway. You have to explicitly add a Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT) rule to [allow inbound traffic](/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic#allow-inbound-traffic-through-azure-firewall) through Azure Firewall to the ingress gateway.

### Step 2: Configure gateways, virtual services, and destination rules correctly

When you configure gateways, virtual services, and destination rules for traffic routing through the ingress gateway, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that the ingress gateway selector in the gateway resource is set to one of the following text values if you're using an external or internal gateway, respectively:

   - `istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-external`
   - `istio: aks-istio-ingressgateway-internal`

1. Make sure that the ports are set correctly in gateways and virtual services. For the gateway, the port should be set to `80` for `http` or `443` for `https`. For the virtual service, the port should be set to the port that the corresponding service for the application is listening on.

1. Verify that the service is exposed within the `hosts` specification for both the gateway and the virtual service. If you experience issues that are related to the `Host` header in the requests, try adding to the allowlist all hosts that contain an asterisk wildcard ("*"), such as in this [example gateway configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/istio/istio/release-1.19/samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml). However, we recommend that you don't amend the allowlist as a production practice. Also, the `hosts` specification should be [configured explicitly](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-practices/security/#avoid-overly-broad-hosts-configurations).

### Step 3: Fix the health of the ingress gateway pod

If the ingress gateway pod crashes or doesn't appear in the ready state, verify that the Istio daemon (`istiod`) control plane pod is in the ready state. The ingress gateway depends on having the `istiod` release be ready.

If the `istiod` pod doesn't appear in the ready state, make sure that the Istio custom resource definitions (CRDs) and the `base` Helm chart is installed correctly. To do this, run the following command:

```bash
helm ls --all --all-namespaces
```

You might see a broader error in which the add-on installation isn't configured specifically to the ingress gateway.

If the `istiod` pod is healthy, but the ingress gateway pods aren't responding, inspect the following ingress gateway resources in the `aks-istio-ingress` namespace to collect more information:

- Helm release
- Deployment
- Service

Additionally, you can find more information about gateway and sidecar debugging in [General Istio service mesh add-on troubleshooting](./istio-add-on-general-troubleshooting.md).

### Step 4: Configure resource utilization

High resource utilization occurs when the default min/max replica settings for Istiod and the gateways aren't sufficient. In this case, change [horizontal pod autoscaling](/azure/aks/istio-scale) configurations.

### Step 5: Troubleshoot the secure ingress gateway

When an [external ingress gateway is configured to expose a secure HTTPS service using simple or mutual TLS](/azure/aks/istio-secure-gateway), follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify that the values of the `INGRESS_HOST_EXTERNAL` and `SECURE_INGRESS_PORT_EXTERNAL` environment variables are valid based on the output of the following command:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get service aks-istio-ingressgateway-external
   ```

1. Check for error messages in the gateway controller's logs:

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n aks-istio-ingress <gateway-service-pod>
   ```

1. Verify that the secrets are created in the `aks-istio-ingress` namespace:

   ```bash
   kubectl -n aks-istio-ingress get secrets
   ```

For the example in [Secure ingress gateway for Istio service mesh add-on for Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/istio-secure-gateway), the `productpage-credential` secret should be listed.

After you enable the Azure Key Vault secrets provider add-on, you have to grant access for the user-assigned managed identity of the add-on to the Azure Key Vault. Incorrectly setting up access to Azure Key Vault will prevent the `productpage-credential` secret from being created.

After you create the `SecretProviderClass` resource, to ensure secrets sync from Azure Key Vault to the cluster, ensure the sample pod `secrets-store-sync-productpage` that references this resource is successfully deployed.
