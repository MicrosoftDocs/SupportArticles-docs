# Istio service mesh add-on minor revision upgrade troubleshooting

This article discusses troubleshooting scenarios and restrictions in the minor revision upgrade and rollback processes for the Istio service mesh add-on in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

> [!NOTE]
> Istio uses the term "revisions" to implement the canary upgrade process and distinguish between versions. Each revision designation (written as *x*-*y*) corresponds to a major.minor version designation (*x*.*y*). You can control your control plane revision, but you can't control the specific patch version within a revision band.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

- The Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) tool, or a similar tool to connect to the cluster. To install kubectl by using [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), run the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

## Troubleshooting matrix

The following table lists various problems and the different scenarios and solutions for those problems.

| Scenario | Problem | Solution |
|--|--|--|
| Data plane workloads are dropped from the mesh. | Data plane and control plane revisions didn't correspond before you completed or rolled back an upgrade. | <p>Follow these steps:</p><ol> <li><p>Relabel namespaces that contain workloads by specifying the revision that's expected to exist after the upgrade completion or rollback:</p><pre>kubectl label namespace default istio.io/rev=asm-x-y --overwrite</pre></li> <li><p>Restart the corresponding workload deployments using the [kubectl rollout restart](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_rollout/kubectl_rollout_restart/) command to trigger sidecar reinjection of the correct revision:</p><pre>kubectl rollout restart deployment \<deployment name></pre></li> <li><p>Verify that the sidecar images exist using the [kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_get/) command:</p><pre>kubectl get pods --namespace \<namespace> --output yaml \| grep mcr.microsoft.com/oss/istio/proxyv2:</pre></li> </ol> |
| Control plane pods are in the pending state. | The pods lack capacity. | Verify the state of the pods by running the [kubectl describe](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/generated/kubectl_describe/) command. If capacity is the problem, you can scale up your cluster to add another node. For more information, see [Manually scale the node count in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](/azure/aks/scale-cluster). |
| The [az aks mesh get-upgrades](/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-upgrades) command returns no available upgrades. | The next Istio revision might be incompatible with the current AKS cluster version. | You can use the [az aks mesh get-revisions](/cli/azure/aks/mesh#az-aks-mesh-get-revisions) command to discover whether newer Istio revisions exist. The output includes a list of compatible cluster versions for each Istio revision. Therefore, you can determine whether a cluster upgrade is necessary. If _both_ mesh and cluster are no longer supported, upgrade the cluster version first, and then the mesh revision. To recover from this scenario, a cluster upgrade is permitted even if it's incompatible with the mesh revision. |


> [!NOTE]
> To avoid unintended behavior and broken functionality, and also make sure that you're receiving updates for security vulnerabilities, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to a supported and up-to-date [AKS version](/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions) and Istio add-on revision. Remember that the add-on revision should also be within the supported Kubernetes version range for the given AKS cluster. As highlighted in the [Minor revision upgrade](/azure/aks/istio-upgrade#minor-revision-upgrade) section of the Istio upgrade article, you can run the `az aks mesh get-revisions` and `az aks mesh get-upgrades` commands to learn about available add-on revisions, upgrades, and compatibility information.

## Restrictions

- A downgrade to an older revision (outside the canary rollback process) isn't allowed.

- Available upgrades for a revision depend on whether it's currently supported. For example, if `n` is the currently installed revision and `n+2` is the latest revision:
  - If `n` is supported, you may upgrade to the next revision `n+1` or directly to the newest revision `n+2`.
  - If both `n` and `n+1` (next consecutive) are unsupported, the only available upgrade is `n+2` (next supported).
  - If `n` has been unsupported for a while, it's possible both of the next two consecutive revisions are unsupported. In this case, the only available upgrade is the lowest supported revision.

- The Istio `sidecar.istio.io/inject` label doesn't enable sidecar injection for the Istio add-on. You must use the `istio.io/rev` label when you label and relabel your namespaces during the canary upgrade.

- Labeling must occur on a namespace level instead of on a per-deployment level. If you want to be able to roll over pods individually, you can choose to restart individual deployments instead of using pod labeling.

- If you're using the Istio add-on Shared MeshConfig, you have to copy or transfer MeshConfig settings to the new ConfigMap before you do a canary upgrade. For more information, see [Mesh configuration and upgrades](/azure/aks/istio-meshconfig#mesh-configuration-and-upgrades).

- The Istio add-on deploys Istio ingress gateway pods and deployments per revision. If you're doing a [canary upgrade](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/canary/) and have two control plane revisions installed in your cluster, you might have to troubleshoot multiple ingress gateway pods across both revisions.
