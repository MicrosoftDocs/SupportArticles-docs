This article helps you troubleshoot a scenario in which a third-party scanner detects a run-time host incident in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Symptoms

You receive an alert that states that a third-party scanner (such as Prisma) detects a run-time host incident in AKS.

## Cause

The alert is typically generated by the container file system.

## Solution

To mitigate any security concerns about unauthorized access to your AKS cluster, make sure that the container and its associated components come from trusted sources.
