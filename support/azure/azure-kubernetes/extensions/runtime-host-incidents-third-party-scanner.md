# Third-party scanner detects run-time host incident

This article helps you troubleshoot a scenario in which a third-party scanner detects a run-time host incident in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Symptoms

You receive an alert that states that a third-party scanner (such as Prisma) detects a run-time host incident in AKS.

## Cause

The alert is typically generated by the container file system.

## Solution

Determine which particular container caused the alert. Review the container in question to determine whether there are any alarming indicators. To mitigate any security concerns about unauthorized access to your AKS cluster, make sure that the container and its associated components come from trusted sources.
