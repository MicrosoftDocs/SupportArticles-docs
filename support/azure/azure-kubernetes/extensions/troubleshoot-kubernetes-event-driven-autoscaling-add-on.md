# Troubleshoot the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling add-on

This article discusses how to troubleshoot the Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on to the Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). When you deploy the KEDA AKS add-on, you might experience problems that are associated with the configuration of the application autoscaler. This article will help you troubleshoot errors and resolve common problems that affect the add-on but aren't covered in the official KEDA [FAQ][keda-faq] and [troubleshooting guide][keda-troubleshooting].

## Prerequisites

- The Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) tool. To install kubectl by using the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), run the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.

## KEDA add-on support

The KEDA add-on follows a similar support model to other [AKS add-ons](/azure/aks/integrations). All [Azure KEDA scalers](https://keda.sh/docs/scalers/) are supported, but AKS doesn't support third-party scalers. If you encounter issues with third-party scalers, open an issue in the official [KEDA GitHub repository](https://github.com/kedacore/keda).

## Troubleshooting checklist

Verify and troubleshoot KEDA components by using the instructions in the following sections.

### Check the available KEDA version

You can determine the available KEDA version by using the [kubectl get](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#get) command:

```bash
kubectl get crd/scaledobjects.keda.sh -o custom-columns='APP:.metadata.labels.app\.kubernetes\.io/version'
```

The command output displays the installed version of KEDA:

```output
APP
2.8.1
```

### Make sure that the cluster firewall is configured correctly

KEDA might not scale applications successfully because it can't start.

When you check the operator logs, you might find error entries that resemble the following text:

```output
1.6545953013458195e+09 ERROR Failed to get API Group-Resources {"error": "Get \"https://10.0.0.1:443/api?timeout=32s\": EOF"}

main.main
/workspace/main.go:97
runtime.main
/usr/local/go/src/runtime/proc.go:255
```

In the metric server section, you might discover that KEDA can't start:

```output
I0607 09:53:05.297924 1 main.go:147] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="KEDA Version: 2.7.1"
I0607 09:53:05.297979 1 main.go:148] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="KEDA Commit: "
I0607 09:53:05.297996 1 main.go:149] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="Go Version: go1.17.9"
I0607 09:53:05.298006 1 main.go:150] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="Go OS/Arch: linux/amd64"
E0607 09:53:15.344324 1 logr.go:279] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="Failed to get API Group-Resources" "error"="Get \"https://10.0.0.1:443/api?timeout=32s\": EOF"
E0607 09:53:15.344360 1 main.go:104] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="failed to setup manager" "error"="Get \"https://10.0.0.1:443/api?timeout=32s\": EOF"
E0607 09:53:15.344378 1 main.go:209] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="making provider" "error"="Get \"https://10.0.0.1:443/api?timeout=32s\": EOF"
E0607 09:53:15.344399 1 main.go:168] keda_metrics_adapter "msg"="unable to run external metrics adapter" "error"="Get \"https://10.0.0.1:443/api?timeout=32s\": EOF"
```

This scenario probably means that the KEDA add-on isn't able to start because of a misconfigured firewall. To make sure that KEDA runs correctly, configure the firewall to meet the [Azure Global required network rules][aks-firewall-requirements].

### Enable the add-on for clusters with self-managed open-source KEDA installations

In theory, you can install KEDA many times, even though Kubernetes allows only one metric server to be installed. However, we don't recommend multiple installations because only one installation would work.

When the KEDA add-on is installed on an AKS cluster, the previous installation of open-source KEDA will be overridden, and the add-on will take over. In this scenario, the customization and configuration of the self-installed KEDA deployment will be lost and no longer applied.

Though the existing autoscaling might continue to be operational, this situation introduces a risk. The KEDA add-on will be configured differently, and it won't support features such as managed identity. To prevent errors during the installation, we recommend that you uninstall existing KEDA installations before you enable the KEDA add-on.

To determine which metrics adapter is used by KEDA, run the `kubectl get` command:

```bash
kubectl get APIService/v1beta1.external.metrics.k8s.io -o custom-columns='NAME:.spec.service.name,NAMESPACE:.spec.service.namespace'
```

An overview shows the service and namespace that Kubernetes will use to get metrics:

```output
NAME                              NAMESPACE
keda-operator-metrics-apiserver   kube-system
```

> [!WARNING]
> If the namespace isn't `kube-system`, the AKS add-on is being ignored, and another metric server is being used.

### How to restart KEDA operator pods when workload identity isn't injected properly

If you're using [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) and you enable KEDA before the Workload ID is used, you must restart the KEDA operator pods. This ensures the correct environment variables are injected. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Restart the pods by running the following command:

     ```bash
     kubectl rollout restart deployment keda-operator -n kube-system
     ```

2. Obtain KEDA operator pods by running the following command, and then locate pods with names starting with 'keda-operator'.

     ```bash
    kubectl get pod -n kube-system
     ```

3. To verify that the environment variables have been successfully injected, run the following command:

     ```bash
    kubectl describe pod <keda-operator-pod-name> -n kube-system
     ```
     If the variables have been successfully injected, you should see values for `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`, and `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST` in the **Environment** section.
