# Basic troubleshooting of Node Not Ready failures

This article provides troubleshooting steps to recover Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes after a failure. This article specifically addresses the most common error messages that are generated when a Node Not Ready failure occurs, and explains how node repair functionality can be done for both Windows and Linux nodes.

## Before you begin

Read the [official guide for troubleshooting Kubernetes clusters](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/_print/). Also, read the [Microsoft engineer's guide to Kubernetes troubleshooting](https://github.com/feiskyer/kubernetes-handbook/blob/master/en/troubleshooting/index.md). This guide contains commands for troubleshooting pods, nodes, clusters, and other features.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), version 2.31 or a later version. If Azure CLI is already installed, you can find the version number by running `az --version`.

## Basic troubleshooting

AKS continuously monitors the health state of worker nodes, and automatically repairs the nodes if they become unhealthy. The Azure Virtual Machine (VM) platform [maintains VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/maintenance-and-updates) that experience issues. AKS and Azure VMs work together to reduce service disruptions for clusters.

For nodes, there are two forms of heartbeats:

- Updates to the *.status* file of a `Node` object.

- [Lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/cluster-resources/lease-v1/) objects within the [kube-node-lease](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) namespace. Each `Node` has an associated `Lease` object.

Compared to updates to the *.status* file of a `Node`, a `Lease` is a lightweight resource. Using `Lease` objects for heartbeats reduces the performance impact of these updates for large clusters.

The [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) is responsible for creating and updating the *.status* file for `Node` objects. It's also responsible for updating the `Lease` objects that are related to the `Node` objects.

The kubelet updates the `Node` *.status* file if one of the following conditions is true:

- A change in status occurs.

- No update occurs after a configured interval of time.

The default interval for status updates to a `Node` is five minutes. This interval is much longer than the 40-second default time-out for unreachable nodes. The kubelet creates and then updates its `Lease` object one time every ten seconds (the default update interval). Updates to `Lease` occur independently from updates to the `Node` status. If the `Lease` update fails, the kubelet retries, using an exponential backoff that starts at 200 milliseconds and is capped at a maximum of seven seconds.

You can't schedule a `Pod` on a `Node` that has a status of `NotReady` or `Unknown`. You can schedule a `Pod` only on nodes that are in the `Ready` state.

If your node is in the `MemoryPressure`, `DiskPressure`, or `PIDPressure` state, you must manage your resources in order to schedule extra pods on the node. If your node is in `NetworkUnavailable` mode, you must configure the network on the node correctly. Make sure that the following conditions are met:

- Your cluster is in **Succeeded (Running)** state. To check the cluster status on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Kubernetes services**, and select the name of your AKS cluster. Then, on the cluster's **Overview** page, look in **Essentials** to find the **Status**. Or, enter the [az aks show](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-show) command in Azure CLI.

In the Essentials section, the Status is 'Succeeded (Running)'." border="true":::

- Your node pool has a **Provisioning state** of **Succeeded** and a **Power state** of **Running**. To check the node pool status on the Azure portal, return to your AKS cluster's page, and then select **Node pools**. Alternatively, enter the [az aks nodepool show](/cli/azure/aks/nodepool#az-aks-nodepool-show) command in Azure CLI.

- The required egress ports are open in your network security groups (NSGs) and firewall so that the API server's IP address can be reached. For more information, see [Required outbound network rules and FQDNs for AKS clusters](/azure/aks/limit-egress-traffic#required-outbound-network-rules-and-fqdns-for-aks-clusters).

- Your nodes [have deployed the latest node images](/azure/aks/node-image-upgrade).

- Your nodes are in the `Running` state instead of `Stopped` or `Deallocated`.

- Your cluster is running an [AKS-supported version of Kubernetes](/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions).
