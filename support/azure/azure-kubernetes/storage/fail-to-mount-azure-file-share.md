# Errors when mounting an Azure file share

This article provides possible causes and solutions for errors that cause the mounting of an Azure file share to fail.

## Symptoms

You deploy a Kubernetes resource such as a Deployment or a StatefulSet, in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) environment. The deployment will create a pod that mounts a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) referencing an Azure file share.

However, the pod stays in the **ContainerCreating** status. When you run the `kubectl describe pods` command, you might see one of the following errors in the command output, which causes the mounting operation to fail:

- [Mount error(2): No such file or directory](#mounterror2)
- [Mount error(13): Permission denied](#mounterror13)

Refer to the following output as an example:

```output
MountVolume.MountDevice failed for volume "\<pv-fileshare-name>"
rpc error: code = Internal desc =
volume(\<storage-account's-resource-group>#\<storage-account-name>#\<pv/fileshare-name>#) > mount "//\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/\<pv-fileshare-name>" on "/var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/csi/pv/\<pv-fileshare-name>/globalmount" failed with
mount failed: exit status 32
Mounting command: mount
Mounting arguments: -t cifs -o dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777,uid=0,gid=0,mfsymlinks,cache=strict,actimeo=30,\<masked> //\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/\<pv-name> /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/csi/pv/\<pv-name>/globalmount
Output: mount error(\<error-id>): \<error-description>
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs) and kernel log messages (dmesg)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If the storage account is publicly accessible, the hostname displayed in the output will be *\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net*.
> - If the storage account is configured privately with a private link, endpoint, or DNS zone, the hostname will be *\<storage-account-name>.privatelink.file.core.windows.net*.

## Before troubleshooting

According to the message in the output, as shown in the following example, identify the storage account and file share—the values will be used in later troubleshooting steps.

> mount "//\<storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net/\<pv-fileshare-name>"

See the following sections for possible causes and solutions.

## <a id="mounterror2"></a>Mount error(2): No such file or directory

This error indicates that there's no connectivity between the AKS cluster and the storage account.

### Initial troubleshooting

[Azure File relies on SMB protocol (port 445)](/azure/storage/files/storage-files-networking-overview#accessing-your-azure-file-shares). Make sure that port 445 and/or the IP address of the storage account aren't blocked.

To check the IP address of the storage account, run a Domain Name System (DNS) command like `nslookup`, `dig`, or `host`. For example:

```console
nslookup <storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net
```

To check if there's connectivity between the AKS cluster and the storage account, get inside the [node](/azure/aks/ssh) or [pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#exec) and run the following `nc` or `telnet` command:

```console
nc -v -w 2 <storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net 445
```

```console
telnet <storage-account-name>.file.core.windows.net 445
```

### Possible causes for mount error(2)

- [Cause 1: File share doesn't exist](#filesharenotexist)
- [Cause 2: NSG blocks traffic between AKS and storage account](#nsgblockstraffic)
- [Cause 3: Virtual Appliance blocks traffic between AKS and storage account](#virtualapplianceblockstraffic)
- [Cause 4: FIPS enabled node pool is used](#fipsnodepool)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Cause 1, 2, and 4 apply to public and private storage account scenarios.
> - Cause 3 applies to the public scenario only.

### <a id="filesharenotexist"></a>Cause 1: File share doesn't exist

To check if the file share exists, follow these steps:

1. Search **Storage accounts** in the Azure portal and access your storage account.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-lists.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage accounts list in Azure portal." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-lists.png":::

2. Select **File shares** under **Data storage** in the storage account and check if the associated PersistentVolumeClaim in the yaml file of the pod, deployment, or statefulset exists in **File shares**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/file-shares.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting file shares in the storage account." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/file-shares.png":::

#### Solution: Ensure file share exists

To resolve this issue, make sure that the file share that's associated with the PV/PVC exists.

### <a id="nsgblockstraffic"></a>Cause 2: Network Security Group blocks traffic between AKS and storage account

Check the output of the `nc` or `telnet` command mentioned in the [Initial troubleshooting](#initial-troubleshooting) section. If a timeout is displayed, check the [Network Security Group (NSG)](/azure/virtual-network/network-security-groups-overview) and make sure that the IP address of the storage account isn't blocked.

To check if the NSG blocks the IP address of the storage account, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, go to [Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) and select **NSG diagnostic**.
2. Fill the fields by using the following values:

    - **Protocol**: Any
    - **Direction**: Outbound
    - **Source type**: IPv4 address/CIDR
    - **IPv4 address/CIDR**: The IP address of an instance that's associated with the AKS node
    - **Destination IP address**: The IP address of the storage account
    - **Destination port**: 445

3. Select the **Check** button and check the **Traffic** status.

The **Traffic** status can be **Allowed** or **Denied**. The **Denied** status means that the NSG is blocking the traffic between the AKS cluster and storage account. If the status is **Denied**, the NSG name will be shown.

#### Solution: Allow connectivity between AKS and storage account

To resolve this issue, perform changes accordingly at the NSG level to allow the connectivity between the AKS cluster and the storage account on port 445.

### <a id="virtualapplianceblockstraffic"></a>Cause 3: Virtual Appliance blocks traffic between AKS and storage account

If you're using a Virtual Appliance (usually a firewall) to control outbound traffic of the AKS cluster (for example, the Virtual Appliance has a route table applied at the AKS cluster's subnet, and the route table has routes that send traffic towards the Virtual Appliance), the Virtual Appliance may block traffic between the AKS cluster and the storage account.

To isolate the issue, add a route in the route table for the IP address of the storage account to send the traffic towards the Internet.

To confirm which route table controls the traffic of the AKS cluster, follow these steps:

1. Go to the AKS cluster in the Azure portal and select **Properties** > **Infrastructure resource group**.
2. Access the virtual machine scale set (VMSS) or a VM in an availability set if you're using such VM set type.
3. Select **Virtual network/subnet** > **Subnets** and identify the subnet of the AKS cluster. On the right side, you'll see the route table.

To add the route in the route table, follow the steps in [Create a route](/azure/virtual-network/manage-route-table#create-a-route) and fill in the following fields:

- **Address prefix**: \<storage-account's-public-IP>/32
- **Next hop type**：Internet

This route will send all traffic between the AKS cluster and storage account through the public Internet.

After you add the route, test the connectivity by using the `nc` or `telnet` command and perform the mounting operation again.

#### Solution: Ensure Virtual Appliance allows traffic between AKS and storage account

If the mounting operation succeeds, we recommend that you consult your networking team to make sure that the Virtual Appliance can allow traffic between the AKS cluster and storage account on port 445.

### <a id="fipsnodepool"></a>Cause 4: FIPS enabled node pool is used

If you use a [Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) enabled node pool](/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools#add-a-fips-enabled-node-pool), the mounting operation will fail because the FIPS disables some authentication modules, which prevents the mounting of a CIFS share. This behavior is expected and not specific to AKS.

To resolve the issue, use one of the following solutions:

#### Solution 1: Schedule pods on nodes in a non-FIPS node pool

FIPS is disabled by default on AKS node pools and can be enabled only during the node pool creation by using the `--enable-fips-image` parameter.

To resolve the error, you can schedule the pods on nodes in a non-FIPS node pool.

#### Solution 2: Create a pod that can be scheduled on a FIPS-enabled node

To create a pod that can be scheduled on a FIPS-enabled node, follow these steps:

1. Use the Azure File CSI driver to create a custom StorageClass that uses NFS protocol.

    Refer to the following YAML file as an example:
    
    ```yml
    kind: StorageClass 
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1 
    metadata: 
      name: azurefile-sc-fips 
    provisioner: file.csi.azure.com 
    reclaimPolicy: Delete 
    volumeBindingMode: Immediate 
    allowVolumeExpansion: true 
    parameters: 
      skuName: Premium_LRS 
      protocol: nfs 
    ```
    
    The SKU is set to Premium_LRS in the YAML file because Premium SKU is required for NFS. For more information, see [Dynamic Provision](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/azurefile-csi-driver/blob/master/docs/driver-parameters.md#dynamic-provision).
   
    Because of Premium SKU, the minimum size of the file share is 100GB. For more information, see [Create a storage class](/azure/aks/azure-files-dynamic-pv#create-a-storage-class).

2. Create a PVC that references the custom StorageClass *azurefile-sc-fips*.

    Refer to the following YAML file as an example:
    
    ```yml
    apiVersion: v1 
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim 
    metadata: 
      name: azurefile-pvc-fips 
    spec: 
      accessModes: 
        - ReadWriteMany 
      storageClassName: azurefile-sc-fips 
      resources: 
        requests: 
          storage: 100Gi 
    ```

3. Create a pod that mounts the PVC *azurefile-pvc-fips*.

    Refer to the following YAML file as an example:
    
    ```yml
    kind: Pod 
    apiVersion: v1 
    metadata: 
      name: azurefile-pod-fips 
    spec: 
      containers: 
      - name: azurefile-pod-fips 
        image: mcr.microsoft.com/oss/nginx/nginx:1.15.5-alpine 
        resources: 
          requests: 
            cpu: 100m 
            memory: 128Mi 
          limits: 
            cpu: 250m 
            memory: 256Mi 
        volumeMounts: 
        - mountPath: "/mnt/azure" 
          name: volume 
      volumes: 
        - name: volume 
          persistentVolumeClaim: 
            claimName: azurefile-pvc-fips 
    ```

## <a id="mounterror13"></a>Mount error(13): Permission denied

Here are possible causes for this error:

- [Cause 1: Kubernetes secret doesn't reference the correct storage account name or key](#secretnotusecorrectstorageaccountkey)
- [Cause 2: AKS's VNET and subnet aren't allowed for the storage account](#akssubnetnotallowed)
- [Cause 3: Connectivity is via a private link but nodes and the private endpoint are in different VNETs](#aksnotawareprivateipaddress)
- [Cause 4: Storage account is set to require encryption that the client doesn't support](#akssmbencryption)
- [Cause 5: Minimum encryption requirement for a storage account isn't met](#minimumencryption)
- [Cause 6: Security profile is used without the NTLM v2 authentication enabled](#securityprofile)

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Cause 1 applies to public and private scenarios.
> - Cause 2 applies to the public scenario only.
> - Cause 3 applies to the private scenario only.
> - Cause 4 applies to public and private scenarios.
> - Cause 5 applies to public and private scenarios.
> - Cause 6 applies to public and private scenarios.

### <a id="secretnotusecorrectstorageaccountkey"></a>Cause 1: Kubernetes secret doesn't reference correct storage account name or key

If the file share is created [dynamically](/azure/aks/azure-files-dynamic-pv), a [Kubernetes secret resource](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) is automatically created with the name "azure-storage-account-\<storage-account-name>-secret".

If the file share is created [manually](/azure/aks/azure-files-volume), the Kubernetes secret resource should be created manually.

Regardless of the creation method, if the storage account name or the key that's referenced in the Kubernetes secret mismatches the actual value, the mounting operation will fail with the "Permission denied" error.

#### Possible causes for mismatch

- If the Kubernetes secret is created manually, a typo may occur during the creation.

- If a "Rotate key" operation is performed at the storage account level, the changes won't reflect at the Kubernetes secret level. This will lead to a mismatch between the key value at the storage account level and the value at the Kubernetes secret level.

    If a "Rotate key" operation happens, an operation with the name "Regenerate Storage Account Keys" will be displayed in the Activity log of the storage account. Be aware of the [90 days retention period for Activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log#retention-period).

#### Verify mismatch

To verify the mismatch, follow these steps:

1. Search and access the storage account in the Azure portal. Select **Access keys** > **Show keys** in the storage account. You'll see the storage account name and associated keys.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-keys.png" alt-text="Screenshot of storage account name and keys.":::

2. Go to the AKS cluster, select **Configuration** > **Secrets**, and then search and access the associated secret.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/select-storage-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot of searching and selecting storage account." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/select-storage-account.png":::

3. Select **Show** (the eye icon) and compare the values of the storage account name and associated key with the values in Step 1.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-associated-secret-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows storage account name and key in a secret." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-associated-secret-key.png":::

    Before you select **Show**, the values of the storage account name and associated key are encoded into base64 strings. After you select **Show**, the values are decoded.

If you don't have access to the AKS cluster in the Azure portal, perform Step 2 at the kubectl level:

1. Get the YAML file of the Kubernetes secret, and then run the following command to get the values of the storage account name and the key from the output:

    ```console
    kubectl get secret <secret-name> -n <secret-namespace> -o <yaml-file-name>
    ```

2. Use the `echo` command to decode the values of the storage account name and the key and compare them with the values at the storage account level.

    Here's an example to decode the storage account name:

    ```console
    echo -n '<storage account name>' | base64 --decode ;echo
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/command-decode-storage-account-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command that decodes storage account name.":::

#### Solution: Adjust the Kubernetes secret and re-create the pods

If the value of the storage account name or key in the Kubernetes secret doesn't match the value in **Access keys** in the storage account, adjust the Kubernetes secret at the Kubernetes secret level by running the following command:

```console
kubectl edit secret <secret-name> -n <secret-namespace>
```

The value of the storage account name or the key added in the Kubernetes secret configuration should be a base64 encoded value. To obtain the encoded value, use the `echo` command.

Here's an example to encode the storage account name:

```console
echo -n '<storage account name>'| base64 | tr -d '\n' ; echo
```

For more information, see [Managing Secrets using kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-kubectl/).

After the Kubernetes secret `azure-storage-account-<storage-account-name>-secret` has the right values, re-create the pods. Otherwise, those pods will continue to use the old values that aren't valid anymore.

### <a id="akssubnetnotallowed"></a>Cause 2: AKS's VNET and subnet aren't allowed for storage account

If the storage account's network is limited to selected networks, but the VNET and subnet of the AKS cluster aren't added to selected networks, the mounting operation will fail with the "Permission denied" error.

#### Solution: Allow AKS's VNET and subnet for storage account

1. Identify the node that hosts the faulty pod by running the following command:

    ```console
    kubectl get pod <pod-name> -n <namespace> -o wide
    ```

    Check the node from the command output:

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/command-identify-node.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command that can identity node and output.":::

2. Go to the AKS cluster in the Azure portal, select **Properties** > **Infrastructure resource group**, access the VMSS associated with the node, and then check **Virtual network/subnet** to identify the VNET and subnet.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/virtual-network-subnet-value.png" alt-text="Screenshot of virtual network/subnet value.":::

3. Access the storage account in the Azure portal. Select **Networking**. If **Allow access from** is set to **Selected networks**, check if the VNET and subnet of the AKS cluster are added.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/check-virtual-network-added.png" alt-text="Screenshot of empty selected networks list." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/check-virtual-network-added.png":::

    If the VNET and subnet of the AKS cluster aren't added, select **Add existing virtual network**. On the **Add networks** page, type the VNET and subnet of the AKS cluster, and then select **Add** > **Save**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/add-networks.png" alt-text="Screenshot of adding networks to storage account.":::

    It may take a few moments for the changes to take effect. After the VNET and subnet are added, check if the pod status changes from **ContainerCreating** to **Running**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/verify-pod-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot of command output that shows current pod status.":::

### <a id="aksnotawareprivateipaddress"></a>Cause 3: Connectivity is via private link but nodes and private endpoint are in different VNETs

When the AKS cluster and storage account are connected via a private link, an approved private endpoint connection is used.

:::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/private-endpoint-connections.png" alt-text="Screenshot of private endpoint connection.":::

In this scenario, if the private endpoint and AKS node are in the same VNET, you'll be able to mount an Azure file share.

If the private endpoint and your AKS cluster are in different VNETs, the mounting operation will fail with the "Permission denied" error.

#### Solution: Create virtual network link for VNET of AKS cluster at private DNS zone

[Get inside the node](/azure/aks/node-access) and check if the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is resolved via a public or private IP address. To do this, run the following command:

```console
nslookup <storage-account-name>.privatelink.file.core.windows.net
```

If the FQDN is resolved via a public IP address (see the following screenshot), create a virtual network link for the VNET of the AKS cluster at the private DNS zone ("privatelink.file.core.windows.net") level. Note that a virtual network link is already automatically created for the VNET of the storage account's private endpoint.

:::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/verify-fqdn-resolved.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows FQDN is resolved by a public IP address.":::

To create the virtual network link, follow these steps:

1. Access the Private DNS zone and select **Virtual network links** > **Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-virtual-network-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a virtual network link that's added to the storage account." lightbox="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/storage-account-virtual-network-link.png":::

2. Fill in the fields and select the VNET of the AKS cluster for **Virtual networks**. For how to identify the VNET of the AKS cluster, see the [Solution: Allow AKS's VNET and subnet for storage account](#solution-allow-akss-vnet-and-subnet-for-storage-account) section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/add-virtual-network-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add virtual network link.":::

3. Select **OK**.

After the virtual network link is added, the FQDN should be resolved via a private IP address, and the mounting operation should succeed. See the following screenshot for an example:

:::image type="content" source="media/fail-to-mount-azure-file-share/private-ip-address-resolved.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows private ip address is resolved.":::

### <a id="akssmbencryption"></a>Cause 4: Storage account is set to require encryption that the client doesn't support

[Azure Files Security Settings](/azure/storage/files/files-smb-protocol?tabs=azure-portal#smb-security-settings) contain a number of options for controlling the security and encryption settings on storage accounts. Restricting allowed methods and algorithms can prevent clients from connecting.

AKS versions earlier than 1.25 are based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, which uses the Linux 5.4 kernel and only supports the AES-128-CCM and AES-128-GCM encryption algorithms. The **Maximum security** profile, or a **Custom** profile that disables AES-128-GCM, will cause share mapping failures.

AKS versions 1.25 and later versions are based on Ubuntu 22.04, which uses the Linux 5.15 kernel and has support for AES-256-GCM.

#### Solution: Allow AES-128-GCM encryption algorithm to be used

Enable the AES-128-GCM algorithm by using the **Maximum compatibility** profile or a **Custom** profile that enables AES-128-GCM. For more information, see [Azure Files Security Settings](/azure/storage/files/files-smb-protocol?tabs=azure-portal#smb-security-settings).

### <a id="minimumencryption"></a>Cause 5: Minimum encryption requirement for a storage account isn't met

#### Solution: Enable AES-128-GCM encryption algorithm for all storage accounts

To successfully mount or access a file share, the AES-128-GCM encryption algorithm should be enabled for all storage accounts.

If you want to use the AES-256-GCM encryption only, do the following:

#### Linux

Use the following script to check if the client supports AES-256-GCM and enforce it only if it does:

```bash
cifsConfPath="/etc/modprobe.d/cifs.conf"
echo "$(date) before change ${cifsConfPath}:"
cat ${cifsConfPath}

# Check if 'require_gcm_256' is already present in the configuration file
if ! grep -q "require_gcm_256" "${cifsConfPath}"; then

    # Load the CIFS module
    modprobe cifs

    # Set the parameter at runtime
    echo 1 > /sys/module/cifs/parameters/require_gcm_256

    # Persist the configuration
    echo "options cifs require_gcm_256=1" >> "${cifsConfPath}"

    echo "$(date) after changing ${cifsConfPath}:"
    cat "${cifsConfPath}"
else
    echo "require_gcm_256 is already set in ${cifsConfPath}"
fi
```

You can also use a Kubernetes DaemonSet to enforce AES-256 on every node. See the following example:

[support-cifs-aes-256-gcm.yaml](https://github.com/andyzhangx/demo/blob/master/aks/support-cifs-aes-256-gcm.yaml)

#### Windows

Use the [Set-SmbClientConfiguration](/powershell/module/smbshare/set-smbclientconfiguration) PowerShell command to specify the encryption ciphers used by the SMB client and the preferred encryption type without user confirmation:

```powershell
Set-SmbClientConfiguration -EncryptionCiphers "AES_256_GCM" -Confirm:$false
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `EncryptionCiphers` parameter is available beginning with the 2022-06 Cumulative Update for Windows Server version 21H2 for x64-based systems ([KB5014665](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5014665)) and the Cumulative Update for Windows 11, version 22H2 ([KB5014668](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5014668)).

### <a id="securityprofile"></a>Cause 6: Security profile is used without the NTLM v2 authentication enabled

When you use the **Maximum security** profile or a **Custom** security profile without the **NTLM v2** authentication mechanism enabled, the mounting operation will fail with the "Mount error(13): Permission denied" error.

#### Solution: Enable the NTLM v2 authentication or use the "Maximum compatibility" profile

To mount it properly in AKS, you have to enable the **NTLM v2** authentication mechanism for the **Custom** security profile or use the **Maximum compatibility** security profile.
