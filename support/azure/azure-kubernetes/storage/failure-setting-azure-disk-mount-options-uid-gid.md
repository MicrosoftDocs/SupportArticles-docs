# Can't set the uid and gid mounting options on an Azure disk

This article discusses how to fix issues that occur on a Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster when you try to set the mounting options for user identifier (`uid`) and group identifier (`gid`) on an Azure disk.

## Symptoms

If you try to set `uid` and `gid` to 1000 in the `mountOptions` setting of the Azure disk's storage class configuration, you receive an error that resembles the following text:

```output
Warning  FailedMount             63s                  kubelet, aks-nodepool1-29460110-0  MountVolume.MountDevice failed for volume "pvc-d783d0e4-85a1-11e9-8a90-369885447933" : azureDisk - mountDevice:FormatAndMount failed with mount failed: exit status 32

```

## Cause

Azure disk uses the ext4/xfs filesystem by default, and mounting options such as `uid=x,gid=x` can't be set at mount time.

## Workaround 1: Use a pod security context to specify the user and group

[Configure the security context for a pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/). In the pod configuration file (YAML format), within the `spec`/`securityContext` field, set the `runAsUser` field to the previously specified `uid` value, and set the `fsGroup` field to the previously specified `gid` value. For example, the beginning of the configuration file might resemble the following code:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 0
    fsGroup: 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the `gid` and `uid` options are mounted as root or 0. If those options are set as non-root (such as 1000), Kubernetes will use the change owner command (`chown`) to change all directories and files within that disk. This operation can be time-consuming, and it might make the disk-mounting operation very slow.

## Workaround 2: Use an init container and the change owner command to specify the user and group

Set up an [init container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/), and then run a [chown](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/chown.html) command that specifies the user and group values in the container. The following code shows how to set up an init container to set the user and group:

```yaml
initContainers:
- name: volume-mount
  image: mcr.microsoft.com/aks/fundamental/base-ubuntu:v0.0.11
  command: ["sh", "-c", "chown -R 100:100 /data"]
  volumeMounts:
  - name: <your-data-volume>
    mountPath: /data
```
