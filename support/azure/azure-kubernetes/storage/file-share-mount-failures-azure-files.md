# File share mounting failures for Azure Files

This article discusses how to troubleshoot file share mounting failures for Azure Files so that you can set up storage successfully on your Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters.

## Common cause

Your storage account key has changed. This problem can cause a range of errors. The following pod error is typical:
```
Error: failed to generate container "56907e9807c6f4203c3aace8c5a6e3a75832cf07d3080a3869d355114657b54f" spec: failed to generate spec: failed to stat "/var/lib/kubelet/pods/xxxxxxxx-9fe6-46d7-b12e-339951b8d2f5/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/pvc-xxxxxxxx-3b70-498c-b357-3488e1c1f429/mount": stat /var/lib/kubelet/pods/xxxxxxxx-9fe6-46d7-b12e-339951b8d2f5/volumes/kubernetes.io~csi/pvc-xxxxxxxx-3b70-498c-b357-3488e1c1f429/mount: host is down
```

## Solution

Manually update the `azurestorageaccountkey` field in an Azure file secret to add your base64-encoded storage account key. To make this update, follow these steps:

1. Encode your storage account key in base64 by running the `echo <storage-account-key> | base64` command, such as in the following example:

    ```console
    echo X+ALAAUgMhWHL7QmQ87E1kSfIqLKfgC03Guy7/xk9MyIg2w4Jzqeu60CVw2r/dm6v6E0DWHTnJUEJGVQAoPaBc== | base64
    ```

1. [Update your Azure secret file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#editing-a-secret) by running the `kubectl edit secret` command to open the secret file in your default text editor:

    ```console
    kubectl edit secret azure-storage-account-<storage-account-name>-secret
    ```

1. Change the `azurestorageaccountkey` field to use the new base64-encoded storage account key, and then save the file.

1. Redeploy your pods.

> [!NOTE]
> Simply deleting the pod and allowing it to be re-created might not resolve the issue. Make sure that you redeploy the pod.

After a few minutes, the agent node will retry the Azure File mount operation by using the updated storage key.
