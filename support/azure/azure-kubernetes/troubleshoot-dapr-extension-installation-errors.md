# Troubleshoot Dapr extension installation errors

This article discusses some common error messages that you may receive when you install or update the [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://dapr.io/) extension for Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) or Arc for Kubernetes.

## Scenario 1: Installation fails but doesn't show an error message

If the extension generates an error message when you create or update it, you can inspect where the creation failed by running the [az k8s-extension list](/cli/azure/k8s-extension#az-k8s-extension-list) command:

```azurecli
az k8s-extension list --resource-group <my-resource-group-name> \
    --cluster-name <my-cluster-name> \
    --cluster-type managedClusters
```

If a wrong key is used in the configuration settings, such as `global.ha=false` instead of `global.ha.enabled=false`, the following JSON status is returned. The error message is captured in the `message` property.

```json
"statuses": [
  {
    "code": "InstallationFailed",
    "displayStatus": null,
    "level": null,
    "message": "Error: {failed to install chart from path [] for release [dapr-1]: err [template: dapr/charts/dapr_sidecar_injector/templates/dapr_sidecar_injector_poddisruptionbudget.yaml:1:17: executing \"dapr/charts/dapr_sidecar_injector/templates/dapr_sidecar_injector_poddisruptionbudget.yaml\" at <.Values.global.ha.enabled>: can't evaluate field enabled in type interface {}]} occurred while doing the operation : {Installing the extension} on the config",
    "time": null
  }
],
```

Here's another example of a JSON error message:

```json
"statuses": [
  {
    "code": "InstallationFailed",
    "displayStatus": null,
    "level": null,
    "message": "The extension operation failed with the following error: unable to add the configuration with configId {extension:microsoft-dapr} due to error: {error while adding the CRD configuration: error {failed to get the immutable configMap from the elevated namespace with err: configmaps 'extension-immutable-values' not found }}. (Code: ExtensionOperationFailed)",
    "time": null
  }
]
```

### Solution 1: Restart the cluster, register the service provider, or delete and reinstall Dapr

To fix this issue, try the following methods:

- [Restart your AKS or Arc for Kubernetes cluster](/azure/aks/start-stop-cluster).

- [Register the KubernetesConfiguration service provider](/azure/aks/dapr#register-the-kubernetesconfiguration-service-provider).

- Force delete and [reinstall the Dapr extension](/azure/aks/dapr).

## Scenario 2: Targeted Dapr version doesn't exist

When you try to install the Dapr extension to [target a specific version](/azure/aks/dapr#targeting-a-specific-dapr-version), you receive an error message that states that the Dapr version doesn't exist:

> (ExtensionOperationFailed) The extension operation failed with the following error:  Failed to resolve the extension version from the given values.
>
> Code: ExtensionOperationFailed
>
> Message: The extension operation failed with the following error:  Failed to resolve the extension version from the given values.

### Solution 2: Install again for a supported Dapr version

Try again to install the extension. Make sure that you use a [supported version of Dapr](/azure/aks/dapr#dapr-versions).

## Scenario 3: The targeted Dapr version exists but not in the specified region

Because some versions of Dapr aren't available in all regions, you might receive the following error message:

> (ExtensionTypeRegistrationGetFailed) Extension type microsoft.dapr is not registered in region \<regionname>.
>
> Code: ExtensionTypeRegistrationGetFailed
>
> Message: Extension type microsoft.dapr is not registered in region \<regionname>

### Solution 3: Install in a different region

Install in a [region in which your Dapr version is supported](/azure/aks/dapr#cloudsregions).

## Scenario 4: Dapr is already installed

You try to install the Dapr extension for AKS or Arc for Kubernetes, but you receive an error message that indicates that the `dapr-system` namespace already exists. This error message resembles the following text:

> (ExtensionOperationFailed) The extension operation failed with the following error:  Error: {failed to install chart from path [] for release [dapr-ext]: err [rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with install: ServiceAccount "dapr-operator" in namespace "dapr-system" exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error: key "meta.helm.sh/release-name" must equal "dapr-ext": current value is "dapr"]} occurred while doing the operation : {Installing the extension} on the config

### Solution 4: Uninstall Dapr OSS first

Uninstall the Dapr OSS before you install the Dapr extension. For more information, see [Migrate from Dapr OSS to the Dapr extension for AKS](/azure/aks/dapr-migration).
