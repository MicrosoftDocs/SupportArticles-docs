# Centralized configuration of Activity Logs to Event Hubs

## Introduction

This article provides guidance for setting up Azure Activity Logs to be centrally exported to a single hub in Azure Event Hubs. This setup is useful for organizations that want to streamline log management across multiple Azure subscriptions and forward logs to third-party SIEM solutions.

Organizations often require a centralized approach to manage Activity Logs across numerous subscriptions. This guide discusses common challenges and considerations for configuring Azure Policies to automate streaming these logs to a specified event hub.

## Instructions to configure Activity Logs

1. **Create an Azure Policy for Activity Logs:**
   1. Navigate to the Azure portal, and access the **Azure Policy** service.
   1. Create a policy definition by using the JSON file that's provided in the community example. This policy should automate the enablement of activity log diagnostic settings across all subscriptions under a management group.

2. **Assign the Policy to Management Group:**
   1. Assign the newly created policy to the desired management group that contains the required subscriptions.
   1. Make sure that the policy is set to send data to the specified Event Hub.

3. **Configure Log Analytics Workspace:**
   1. Access **Log Analytics Workspace** in the Azure portal.
   1. Set up data export rules to forward logs from the Log Analytics Workspace to the event hub. Specify the source table as `AzureActivity` and the destination as the central event hub.

4. **Verify event hub configuration:**
   1. Make sure that the event hub is configured to handle the expected log volume from all subscriptions.
   1. Review performance benchmarks and adjust the event hub tier if it's necessary to manage logs efficiently.

5. **Monitor and adjust:**
   1. Regularly monitor the event hub performance and log flow.
   1. Adjust configurations as necessary to optimize performance and cost.

## Common issues and solutions

- **Performance concerns:** If the event hub experiences difficulty in handling the log volume, consider upgrading the tier or distributing logs across multiple hubs.
- **Policy limitations:** Azure Policy might require manual steps for each subscription. Make sure that all configurations are correctly applied.
