# Troubleshooting Activity Log download issues

When users try to download activity logs from Microsoft Azure, they might receive error messages that indicate that the CSV file wasn't prepared. This issue often occurs if the requested logs exceed a certain volume and cause the process to fail. Understanding the root cause and implementing the right solutions can help resolve this issue efficiently.

## Common issues and solutions

- **Issue**: The download process fails because an excessive number of logs are requested. This activity generates a "file not found" error.
- **Solution**: Reduce the range of time during which logs are requested to minimize the volume and prevent errors.

### Instructions to resolve download failures

1. **Identify the error**: Check the error message to verify that it relates to the CSV file preparation failure.
2. **Adjust the time range**: Navigate to the Azure portal, and access the Activity Logs section. Reduce the time range that you're trying to download logs for. This change can help decrease the number of logs that are processed.
3. **Clear the cache**: Clear your browser cache to make sure that no outdated data is causing issues.
4. **Request fewer logs**: If possible, break down the log requests into smaller batches to avoid overwhelming the system.
5. **Check storage account**: Make sure that the storage account where logs are stored is reachable and correctly configured.
