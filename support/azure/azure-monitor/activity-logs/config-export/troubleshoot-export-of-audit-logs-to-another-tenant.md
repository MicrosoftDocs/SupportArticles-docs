# Troubleshoot export of audit logs to another tenant

When users try to export audit logs from one tenant to another by using Microsoft Azure Lighthouse, they might experience permissions-related errors. This article provides guidance to resolve these issues.

## Common issues and solutions

- **Issue**: Permissions errors occur when a user configures diagnostic settings for exporting audit logs.
- **Root cause**: The user lacks the required permissions on the target workspace or has an incorrect role assignment.

### Instructions to resolve export issues

1. Verify the user's permissions:
   1. Make sure that the user has the necessary permissions to perform actions on the target workspace.
   1. Navigate to the Azure portal, and check the user's role assignments in the **Access Control (IAM)** section.

2. Reset the guest invitation:
   1. If the user is a guest, reset the invitation status to ensure proper linkage between home and resource tenants.
   1. Follow the steps in [Reset Guest Invitation Status](/entra/external-id/reset-redemption-status).

3. Check the role assignments:
   1. Verify that the user has the appropriate roles assigned, such as **Log Analytics Contributor** or **Reader**.
   1. Use the Azure portal to assign roles, if it's necessary.

4. Review ARM template role definitions:
   1. Make sure that the ARM template that's used for deployment specifies the correct `RoleDefinitionId` value.
   1. Adjust the template as necessary to include the required permissions.

5. Test the configuration:
   1. Test the configuration to make sure that logs are exported successfully.
   1. Monitor the Azure activity logs for any more error messages or warnings.
