### Step 2: Make sure that your app is connected to an Application Insights resource

[Create an Application Insights resource](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource) and verify that it's connected to the correct app.

### Step 3: Verify that Application Insights Profiler is enabled

[Enable Application Insights Profiler](/azure/azure-monitor/profiler/profiler-overview).

### Step 4: Verify that Application Insights Profiler is collecting profiles

To make sure that profiles are uploaded to your Application Insights resource, follow these stepsï¼š

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Application Insights**.
1. In the list of Application Insights resources, select the name of your resource.
1. In the navigation pane of your Application Insights resource, locate the **Investigate** heading, and then select **Performance**.
1. On the **Performance** page of your Application Insights resource, select **Profiler**:

   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you don't see any profiling sessions, see [Troubleshoot Application Insights Profiler](./profiler-troubleshooting.md).

### Step 5: Regularly check the Profiler

After you successfully complete the previous steps, keep checking the Profiler for insights. Meanwhile, the service continues to analyze your profiles and provide insights as soon as it detects any issues in your code. After you enable the Application Insights Profiler, several hours might be required for you to generate profiles and for the service to analyze them.
