# How to update third-party server configuration

The server side must be able to accept connections that have certain headers. Depending on the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` configuration on the server side, it's often necessary to extend the server-side list by manually adding the `Request-Id`, `Request-Context`, and `traceparent` (W3C distributed header) headers. For example, the configuration might resemble the following text:

`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Request-Id, traceparent, Request-Context, <your header>`.
