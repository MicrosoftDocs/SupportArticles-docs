# Receive duplicate telemetry data from Application Insights JavaScript SDK

If the SDK reports correlation recursively, enable the configuration setting of `excludeRequestFromAutoTrackingPatterns` to exclude the duplicate data. This scenario can occur when you use connection strings. The syntax for the configuration setting is `excludeRequestFromAutoTrackingPatterns: [<endpointUrl>]`.
