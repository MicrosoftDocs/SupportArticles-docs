This article provides a cost analysis tutorial to investigate daily billing anomalies and identify the services that cause unexpected costs.

## Identify the services that cause unexpected costs

1. Sign in to the [Azure Preview portal](https://preview.portal.azure.com). 
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]

1. Enter *Log Analytics* in the search bar.
1. Under **Services**, select **Log Analytics**.
1. Select the Log Analytics workspace that you want to investigate.

1. On the **Overview** page, select **View Cost** to open the **Cost analysis** page for the current Log Analytics service. If you don't see **View Cost**, ensure that you are using the [Azure Preview portal](https://preview.portal.azure.com)(2).

1. On the **Cost analysis** page, select **View AccumulatedCosts**, and then select **Services**.

1. Select the plus sign (+) icon to open a new tab.

1. Select **Daily costs**.

1. In the date selection, select a date range such as **Last 3 months** as the timeline.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the date selection." lightbox="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-4.png":::

1. Select the **Group by** option, and then select **Meter category**.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-4a.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Meter category view." lightbox="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-4a.png":::

1. You're now prepared to analyze an assessment of a cost spike, high usage, or other anomaly. The following example shows cost data from a Log Analytics service over the previous three months, grouped by the **Meter category** selection. In the stacked bar chart, three anomalous cost spikes are evident on March 31, April 30, and May 31. Select the stacked bar for April 30. It indicates that the Azure Grafana service that's linked to this Log Analytics workspace caused the cost spike.

    :::image type="content" source="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of grouping by the Meter category selection." lightbox="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-5.png":::

    Additionally, the example cost is higher during the late May period because of a spike in Azure Sentinel usage. This is indicated by the increased height of the respective segments within the stacked bar.

    :::image type="content" source="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-6.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the example cost." lightbox="media/identify-service-cause-unexpected-costs/high-cost-6.png":::

After you identify the specific services that are causing the cost spike, you might have to investigate those services to understand why the spike occurred. If you need further assistance to investigate the services, check that respective serviceâ€™s cost documentation before opening a support case.
