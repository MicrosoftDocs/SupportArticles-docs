sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I learn more about how to export data from a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          See [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export).

      - question: |
          How can I learn about the limitations of this feature?
        answer: |
          See the [Limitations](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#limitations) section in [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export).

      - question: |
          Why did my data not get exported?
        answer: |
          If the data export rule includes an unsupported table, the configuration will succeed, but data won't be exported for that table. If the table is later supported, then its data will be exported at that time.

      - question: |
          How can I learn whether my table is supported?
        answer: |
          Check the list of [supported tables for workspace data export](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#supported-tables).

      - question: |
          Why am I seeing a "Table does not exist in the workspace" error message?
        answer: |
          If the data export rule includes a table that doesn't exist, the export fails, and it generates that error message.

      - question: |
          How can I find the data export rules that are configured for the workspace?
        answer: |
          In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Log Analytics workspaces**, and then select your workspace from the workspace list. In the workspace menu pane, in the **Settings** section, select **Data Export**. The list of data export rules appears. Each entry displays the rule name, destination type, and status (**Enabled** or **Disabled**).

          To view all data export rules in a workspace in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli), use the [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export list](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-list) command:

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export list \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name>
          ```

      - question: |
          How can I disable an export rule?
        answer: |
          You can disable an export rule to stop the export if you don't have to retain data for a certain period, such as during testing. To disable a data export rule, use the following [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export update](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-update) command in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli):

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export update \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --name <rule-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name> \
              --enable false
          ```

      - question: |
          How can I delete an export rule?
        answer: |
          Use the following [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export delete](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-delete) command in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli):

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export delete \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --name <rule-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name>
          ```

      - question: |
          What occurs if the export destination isn't available?
        answer: |
          Data export is optimized to move large data volume to your destinations. The export operation might fail if the destination doesn't have sufficient capacity or is unavailable. In the event of failure, the retry process continues for up to 12 hours. For more information about destination limits and recommended alerts, see [Create or update a data export rule](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#create-or-update-a-data-export-rule). If the destinations are still unavailable after the retry period, the data is discarded. In certain cases, retry can cause duplication of a fraction of the exported records.

          For more information about data export, see [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#data-completeness).
      - question: |
          When should I use other export options?
        answer: |
          There are scenarios for which more export options are available. For more information, see [Other export options](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#other-export-options).
