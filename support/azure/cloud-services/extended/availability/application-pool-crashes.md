# Troubleshoot application pool crashes on a Cloud Services virtual machine

This article discusses how to resolve application pool crashes on a virtual machine (VM) in Microsoft Azure Cloud Services. If an application pool crashes, your application will stop responding.

## Step 1: Check for errors in processes that serve application pools

In Event Viewer, if you select **Windows Logs** > **System** in the console tree, you might see one of the following events:

> A process serving application pool '%1' suffered a fatal communication error with the Windows Process Activation Service. The process id was '%2'. The data field contains the error number.

> A process serving application pool '%1' terminated unexpectedly. The process id was '%2'. The process exit code was '%3'.

These events clearly indicate an application pool crash. Because something went wrong within the application, the application pool had to be terminated. After the application pool is terminated, its corresponding **w3wp.exe** process is also terminated. Any cache-based or session-based information that you saved within the **w3wp.exe** process will be erased.

## Step 2: Check whether the application pool was automatically disabled because of related process failures

Ideally, when an application pool crashes, a new **w3wp.exe** process is spawned automatically to honor the incoming requests. However, if the application pool crashes more than five times within a period of five minutes, the application pool goes into a stopped state. You'll have to restart the application pool manually to get it up and running. If something similar occurs, you'll observe the following event under the system logs in Event Viewer:

> Application pool '%1' is being automatically disabled due to a series of failures in the process(es) serving that application pool.

You can configure these settings in that application pool's **Advanced Settings** dialog box, under the **Rapid-Fail Protection** section. The **Enabled** property has a default value of **True**. If the **Enabled** property is **True**, the application pool will stop after the failure limit is reached within a certain time. The failure limit is represented by the **Maximum Failures** property. This property has a default value of **5**. The time span is represented by the **Failure Interval (minutes)** property. This property also defaults to **5**.

## Step 3: Capture the w3wp.exe process dump files

After you determine that the application crashed, determine exactly why it crashed. You'll have to capture a dump file of the **w3wp.exe** process just before it terminates. There are many ways to capture this file. You can set up [Windows Error Reporting](/windows/win32/wer/windows-error-reporting) (WER), [ProcDump](/sysinternals/downloads/procdump) and DebugDiag to capture a crash dump file. This article discusses only the DebugDiag method of capturing data.

To download and install DebugDiag, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Debug Diagnostic Tool v2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=103453) site, and then select **Download**.

1. For **Choose the download you want**, select the appropriate Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) file version for your computer architecture, and then select **Next**.

1. Open the downloaded file. In the setup wizard, accept the default options, and then finish installing the app.

To set up the **DebugDiag 2 Collection** application, follow these steps:

1. Select **Start**, enter *DebugDiag 2 Collection*, and then open the newly installed app from the results list.
1. In the **Select Rule Type** dialog box, select the **Crash** option, and then select **Next**.
1. In the **Select Target Type** dialog box, select the **A specific IIS web application pool** option, and then select **Next**.
1. In the **Select Target** dialog box, select the specific application pool that's crashing, and then select **Next**. If a window opens that states that Internet Information Services (IIS) management isn't installed and that the application pools won't be listed, select **OK**, and then enter the application name manually.
1. In the **Advanced Configuration (Optional)** dialog box, select **Breakpoints** > **Add Breakpoint**.
1. Make the following selections to create a new breakpoint, and then select **OK**.

   | Field                 | Description                      | Value                        |
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
   | **Offset Expression** | The process to capture           | **Ntdll!ZwTerminateProcess** |
   | **Action Type**       | The type of dump that's captured | **Full userdump**            |
   | **Action Limit**      | The number of dumps to capture   | **10**                       |

1. In the **Configure Breakpoints** dialog box, verify that the new **Breakpoint Expression** item is shown. Select **Save & Close** to return to the **Advanced Configuration (Optional)** dialog box, and then select **Next** to activate the breakpoint.
1. In the **Select Dump Location And Rule Name (Optional)** dialog box, enter a **Rule Name**, and then, change the **Userdump Location** to a drive and directory that has enough free disk space, if this is necessary. (The size of each dump file will match what's consumed by the **w3wp.exe** process in memory.) 

1. Select **Next**.

1. To activate the rule, select **Finish**.

Now, the crash rule is in an active state, and the **Userdump Count** is **0**. When the issue occurs, the dump count immediately increases, and a corresponding dump file is generated.

> [!NOTE]
> A normal recycle of the application pool can also trigger a dump file. This occurs because, when it recycles, the application pool's corresponding **w3wp.exe** process ID (PID) changes. This generates a dump file. This file is a false positive. Therefore, it won't help you to analyze the application pool crash. Whenever you see an increment in the userdump count, check the event logs to see whether the expected crash events occurred. If the events are as expected, then the dump that was captured is correct.

## Step 4: Analyze the w3wp.exe process dump files

After the dump file is captured, you can open **Start** > **DebugDiag 2 Analysis**. This application lets you analyze the captured crash dump file.

Make sure that you have the symbol path set correctly. This is a two-part process. In **DebugDiag 2 Analysis**, select **Settings** (the gear icon). Under **Symbol search paths to use for Analysis**, verify that **_NT_SYMBOL_PATH** and **Microsoft Public Symbol Servers** are selected.

Reopen **DebugDiag 2 Collection**, and select **Tools** > **Options and Settings**. Then, in the **Options & Settings** dialog box, make sure that your **Symbol Search Path for Debugging (i.e. Crash Rules)** box is set to *srv\*c\:\\symcache\*https\://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols*. This path causes DebugDiag to download symbols as needed from the Microsoft public symbol server, and then store them in the *c:\symcache* directory.

After you change or verify your symbol path settings, you can analyze the captured dump files. To start the analysis, return to **DebugDiag 2 Analysis**, and then double-click the name of a dump file. After the report is generated, you can open it in the browser and understand the call stack of the thread that triggered the breakpoint expression. Read the call stack from bottom to top, and then determine which method or component triggered the application pool to crash. If you can't find a precise exception call stack, look further at the .NET call-stack in the same dump file analysis.

## Step 5: Check for unhandled exceptions in the w3wp.exe or WaWorkerHost.exe process

To also check for any unhandled exceptions that caused the **w3wp.exe** or **WaWorkerHost.exe** process to stop, see [Unhandled exceptions cause ASP.NET-based applications to quit unexpectedly in the .NET Framework](../../../../developer/webapps/aspnet/site-behavior-performance/exceptions-cause-apps-quit.md).
