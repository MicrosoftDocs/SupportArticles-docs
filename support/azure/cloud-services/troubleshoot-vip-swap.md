# Troubleshoot Azure Cloud Service (classic) cloud service VIP swap failures

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cloud Services (classic) is now deprecated for new customers, and it will be retired on August 31st, 2024 for all customers. New deployments should use the new Azure Resource Manager-based deployment model, Azure Cloud Services (extended support).

This article helps you troubleshoot Azure Cloud Service VIP swap failures (VipSwapNotAllowedAsRollingUpgradeIsInProgress exceptions). VIP swap failures typically occur when deploying a new release of a cloud service in a staging environment. After staged deployment, you'll want to migrate it to a production environment by doing a VIP swap. Swaps are easy to manipulate, and require no downtime.

## Symptom

When a VIP swap failure occurs, you might receive either of the following internal server error messages (HTTP status code 500):

> The server encountered an internal error. Please retry the request.

> There was an error processing your request. Try again in a few moments.

## Cause 1: Service role instances aren't ready

Instances of service roles aren't in a started state (busy, recycling, updating, upgrading, and so on). VIP swap is possible only when all the instances are in a healthy state. You can check the status of the instances from the **Overview** pane on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Solution: Check for the compute instances that aren't ready

To check or resolve the state of service role instances:

1. Make sure all compute instances are in a ready state and not a non-ready state.

1. If instances are stuck in a non-ready state, fix the problem before doing the swap. For more information, see the following articles:

## Cause 2: A deployment update or upgrade prevented the VIP swap

A VIP swap was attempted when another deployment update or upgrade is in progress.

### Solution: Check for deployment update or upgrade events

To find out whether an automatic update is preventing a swap:

1. Select your cloud service from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. In the **Properties** pane, look at the **Status** value. If it indicates **Ready**, then check **Last operation** to see whether a recent event prevented the swap.

1. Repeat the previous two steps for the production deployment.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If an automatic update is in process, wait for it to finish before doing the swap.

## Cause 3: A reserved IP address is in use

An attempt to add, change, or remove a reserved IP address was made during an update or upgrade. If you reserve a static IP address for your production slot, be sure to reserve your staging slots as well.

### Solution: Check for static IP address usage

Determine whether the service is using a static IP address for both staging and production environments. Make sure the cloud serviceâ€™s configuration blade shows the correct value for the deployment's reserved IP addresses. If the reserved IP addresses are incorrect, update the configuration file with the correct values.

## Cause 4: A service is in self-healing state

Service self-healing is in progress.

### Solution: Contact Azure support

If a VIP swap failed because a self-healing process is underway, contact [Azure support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) for further assistance.
