When you try to verify the automatic Azure RM service connection, you may receive the following error message:

> Failed to get Azure DevOps Service access token, cache value is invalid.

## Debugging steps

Capture an [F12/Fiddler trace](overview-of-azure-resource-manager-service-connections.md#tools-used-for-troubleshooting-azure-rm-service-connection-scenarios) while you reproduce the issue.

You will see following response for the POST call in the trace:

`{"authorization":{"parameters":{"tenantid":"xxxxxx49-XXXXcexxxxxx","serviceprincipalid":"xxxxxx7e-XXXX-027xxxxxxxxx","authenticationType":"spnKey","serviceprincipalkey":null,"**accesstoken":null**},"scheme":"ServicePrincipal"},"created}`

## Cause

When you run a service connection update call from the UI, the body of the `PUT` request contains an `accesstoken = null` entry. If we compare the `PUT` payload against the working service connections at either end of the operation, we don't see this entry. If the `AccessToken` property is present in the service connection UI object, it should have valid value (such as a GUID). It shouldn't be empty or **null**.

## Resolution

1. Go to the service connection page, and then select the affected service connection.
1. Select **Edit**.
1. Press <kbd>F12</kbd>, and then open the network trace window. If possible, select the **Disable cache** option in the panel under the **Network** tab.
1. Update the description.
1. Select the **Save** button.
1. If you are prompted for authorization, enter the required credentials.
   In network trace, you can now see the PUT call to update the service connection that failed.
1. Open the PUT call details, and copy the **Request Payload** by selecting **Payload > view source > Select the content and copy the content**.
1. From the PUT call details, also copy the Authorization header value.
1. In the request body, remove the **accesstoken: null** (or **accesstoken:''**) property under the authorization header.
1. Copy the updated **Request payload**, and make a service connection update PUT API call by using Postman (or any other REST tool) by running the following API. Make sure to provide the Authorization header you copied earlier when making this call.

   `PUT - https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/_apis/serviceendpoint/endpoints/{endpointId}?api-version=6.0-preview.4`
