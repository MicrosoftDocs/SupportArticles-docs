# Troubleshoot issues when Git clone or push fails to an Azure DevOps repository

This article discusses problems that might occur when you try to perform Git clone or Git push function to an Azure DevOps repository.

_Applies to:_&nbsp; Azure DevOps Services, Azure DevOps Server

## Issues while performing Git clone or Git push to the Azure DevOps repositories

When you try to clone or push a repository in GitHub, some issues with proxy configuration, SSL certificate, or credential cache might cause the Git clone operation to fail.

## Troubleshooting checklist

To identify the cause of the issues, follow these steps:

1. Enable [verbose tracing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt--v) to set the verbose level of tracing for the Git commands that you're running.

2. Set the following variables in sequence, and run the Git commands for each set variable to get more information on the errors.
    - `GIT_TRACE=1`
    - `GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1`
    - `GIT_TRACE_CURL_NO_DATA=1`
    - `GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1`

The level of tracing set for these variables provides more information similar to the following example about the errors that cause issue:

To learn more about Git environment variables, see [Git Internals - Environment Variables](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables).

## Cause 1: Git can't connect through the proxy server

If you're using a proxy server but the Git configuration isn't set to connect through the proxy server, you might see the 407 or 502 error messages. This issue also occurs when the connection can't establish through the proxy server, and you see the errors similar to "unable to access <`your github url`\>:" or "couldn't resolve host `github.com`".

### Solution: Configure Git to use the proxy server

Run `git config --list` to get a list of all the Git configuration on the system, and check whether the proxy server is in use.

If you see multiple configuration files such as repo or system root, run the `git config --list --show-origin` command, and then see the path from where Git retrieves the configuration information.

If you don't find a proxy server in the configurations list, run the `git config --global` command to set a proxy server in configuration.

For example, `http.proxy http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port`.

To use specific proxy for some of URLs, configure the proxy URL in Git config subsection as `http.<url\>.key notation:` similar to the following example:

`git config --global`
`http.https://domain.com.proxy  http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxy.server.com:port`

If the proxy uses `https`, set the Git configuration with `https` proxy URL in the example above. Otherwise, keep `http`.

For more information on Git configuration, see [Git Config Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config).

## Cause 2: Git uses a local self-signed certificate

If Git is using a local self-signed certificate, you might see the error "SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate."

### Solution 1: Disable the TLS/SSL verification

If you've installed a local Team Foundation Server (TFS) and if you want to disable the TLS/SSL verification that Git performs, run the following command:

`git config --global http.sslVerify false`

### Solution 2: Configure the self-signed certificates in Git

If you want to continue the TLS/SSL verification that Git does, follow these steps to add the root certificate in the local Git:

1. Export the root certificate as Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) file by following these steps:
    1. Open Microsoft Edge browser and enter the URL of your TFS server in the address bar such as `https://<servername>/tfs`.
    1. On the address bar, select the :::image type="icon" source="media/git-clone-push-operation-failing-devops/lock-icon.png"::: icon, and then select the **Connection is secure** link.
    1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/git-clone-push-operation-failing-devops/certificate-icon.png"::: icon to open the **Certification** window.
    1. In the **Certification Path** tab, select the upper-left certificate, which is the root certificate.

        :::image type="content" source="media/git-clone-push-operation-failing-devops/viewing-root-certificate-path.png" alt-text="Selecting Certification Path tab in the Certification window.":::

    1. Select **View Certificate** to open **Certificate** window for the root certificate.
    1. On the **Details** tab, select **Copy to File...** .

        :::image type="content" source="media/git-clone-push-operation-failing-devops/copying-certificate-details-file.png" alt-text="Selecting Details tab in the Certification window.":::

    1. On the **Certificate Export Wizard**, select **Next**, and then select **Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)** file format to export.

        :::image type="content" source="media/git-clone-push-operation-failing-devops/selecting-export-file-format.png" alt-text="Selecting file format on the Certificate Export Wizard.":::

    1. Save the root certificate on the local disk.
1. Configure Git to use local directory for Git certificates store by following these steps:
    1. Go to the _C:\Program Files\Git\bin_ path on your local disk, and then make a copy of the _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        >- When you install Git for Windows (`msysgit`) on your device, a _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file is stored in your Program Files directory. This file is the root certificate store for git.exe that contains all the certificates that Git trusts.
        >- The _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file, which stores on a per-device basis, is private to your local Windows client. The text file has UNIX (`\n`) line endings.
        >- In the Git for Windows 2.x series, the path will change to _C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\mingw32\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt_ or _C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\ssl\certs\ca-bundle.crt_. If you are using a 32-bit Windows client, you can fix the folder path such that the Program Files part doesn't appear with _x86_.

    1. Copy the _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file to your user profile directory (_C:\Users\\<yourname\>_). Or run a copy command similar to the `copy "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin\curl-ca-bundle.crt" C:\Users\<yourname>` example.
    1. Run the following command to configure Git to use local copy of certificate store from your Windows client:

        `git config --global http.sslCAInfo C:/Users/<yourname>/curl-ca-bundle.crt`

1. Add the exported root certificate to the local copy of Git certificate store by following these steps:
    1. Open the exported root certificate in Notepad, and then copy entire contents on to the clipboard.
    1. Open the _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file by going to the _C:/Users/\<yourname\>/curl-ca-bundle.crt_ path in a text editor.

        > [!TIP]
        > You can use the _unix2dos_ tool to change the line endings in the file from _\n_ to _\r\n_ and be able to open the file in Notepad.

    1. Add an entry for the root certificate at the end, and then paste the certificate contents into the _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file.
    1. Save the _curl-ca-bundle.crt_ file.
    1. Perform the cloning operation to verify if the SSL error is resolved.

## Cause 3: Authentication error or credential cache issues

If your account name or domain password has changed, or you're getting an authentication error, there could be authentication and credential cache issues.

### Solution: Reset the Git credentials manager (GCM)

To resolve the authentication error or credentials cache issues, begin by following the [Troubleshooting checklist](#troubleshooting-checklist) to get the error information, and then follow these steps:

1. Run the `git config --list` command, and then check if you're using Git Credentials Manager (GCM). If the `credential.helper` is set to manager, then GCM is in use.
1. Reset the GCM by following these steps:
    1. Run the `git config --global --unset credential.helper` command to unset the GCM.
    1. Run the `git config credential.helper manager` command to set the GCM back. Alternatively, follow these steps to delete the credentials cache first:
        1. When unset, search for **Credentials Manager** in Windows search, select **Open**, and then remove any credential that is for a Git repo.
        1. Go to _%localappdata%/GitCredentialManager_ path, and then delete the _tenant.cache_ file.
        1. Set the GCM back by running the `git config credential.helper manager` command.
1. Perform the cloning operation to verify if the issue is resolved.

**Note:** Depending on the version of Git for Windows, the `credential.helper` value would be different. See the following table for details:

|Versions of Git for Windows|Git Credential Manager for Windows|Git Credential Manager Core|Git Credential Manager (Renamed from GCM Core)|
|--|--|--|--|
|2.27 and earlier|`manager` |||
|2.28 to 2.33.0|`manager` (optional)|`manager-core`(optional)||
|2.33.1 to 2.34.0||`manager-core`||
|2.34.1 to 2.38|||`manager-core`|
|2.39 and later|||`manager`|
