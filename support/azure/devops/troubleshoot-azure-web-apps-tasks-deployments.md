# Troubleshoot Azure Web App tasks and deployment issues

This article helps you troubleshoot various issues related to Azure Web App tasks and deployments.

## Tasks documentation

As a first step, we recommend you review the documentation for the following tasks and ensure that all the parameters are correctly defined in the tasks used in the pipelines.

- [Azure RM Web App deployment V4](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureRmWebAppDeploymentV4)
- [Azure Web App V1](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureWebAppV1): Preferably use this task for App Services deployment. For more complicated scenarios like XML transformation, use [Azure RM Web App deployment V4](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureRmWebAppDeploymentV4).
- [Azure Function App](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-app-v1): Consider using this task for Function App deployments.
- [Azure File Copy](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureFileCopyV5)
- [Azure PowerShell](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzurePowerShellV5) ([AzurePowerShell@5 - Azure PowerShell v5 task](/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-powershell-v5))
- [Azure Key Vault](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/AzureKeyVaultV2)
- [Azure SQL deployment](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/tree/master/Tasks/SqlServerDacpacDeployment)

Also, refer to the *readme.doc* in the GitHub repo and this [Deploy to Azure](/azure/devops/pipelines/overview-azure) article for details about the usage of these tasks.

If the task configuration looks fine, refer to the next steps for capturing debug logs.

## Debug logs and tips for further debugging

Debug logs provide important details to help diagnose and troubleshoot issues related to Azure Web App tasks and deployments. Follow these steps to collect logs and further investigate these issues:

1. Enable debug logs by setting [system.debug](/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables#systemdebug) to **True** in the pipeline.

1. If possible, enable verbose logging from the Azure service side.

1. Review details related to Azure services, like networking, to see if it's restricted for public network access, if IPs are open for public network access, or if other network configurations may impact the issue. Also, verify the resource group name and region of the service.

1. If you noticed that the issue started happening suddenly, review the success and failure logs to check for any changes to the task or agent versions.

1. If you're using the Microsoft-hosted agent, check the [runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) documentation for any recent updates related to the Azure module that might have broken the pipeline.

1. Check the [Azure DevOps status history](https://status.dev.azure.com/_history) and the [Azure status history](https://status.azure.com/status/history/) to find out if there are any outages.
