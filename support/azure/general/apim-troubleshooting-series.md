This troubleshooting series will not only help you to get accustomed with various APIM policies but also give you an idea how to leverage [APIM inspector trace](/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-api-inspector) to debug issues related to failed API calls, exceptions thrown from policies, performance problems, etc.
