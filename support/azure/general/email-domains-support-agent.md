# Identify whether an email is from Microsoft support

Microsoft support agents use the following domains to send emails to our customers:

- microsoft.com
- microsoftsupport.com
- mail.support.microsoft.com

If the email claims to be from Microsoft, but the email is being sent from another email domain like microsoftsupport.org, it's probably a phishing scam.

To spot phishing emails, see [Protect yourself from phishing](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/protect-yourself-from-phishing-0c7ea947-ba98-3bd9-7184-430e1f860a44).
