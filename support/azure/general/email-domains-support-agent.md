# How do I know if an email from Microsoft support is genuine?

Microsoft support may contact you by email for various reasons, such as providing technical assistance, confirming your account details, or sending you security alerts. However, not every email that claims to be from Microsoft support is legitimate. Some of them may be phishing scams, which are attempts to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information, or installing malicious software on your device.

One of the ways to identify whether an email is from Microsoft support is to check the sender's email address. Microsoft support uses the following domains to send emails:

- microsoft.com
- microsoftsupport.com
- mail.support.microsoft.com

If the email is being sent from a different domain, it's likely a phishing scam. For example, an email from microsoft-support@outlook.com or support@microsoft.net is not from Microsoft support.

## How do I contact Microsoft Support to report a phishing email?

If you receive an email that you suspect is a phishing scam, do not reply, click on any links, or open any attachments.
