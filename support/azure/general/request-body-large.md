# Error when you write more than 4 MB of data to Azure Storage: Request body is too large

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Storage Account Management  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4016806

## Symptoms

Assume that you try to write more than 4 megabytes (MB) of data to a file on Azure Storage, or you try to upload a file that's larger than 4 MB by using the SAS url (REST API) or HTTPS PUT method. In this scenario, the following error is returned:

> Code : RequestBodyTooLarge  
Message: The request body is too large and exceeds the maximum permissible limit.  
RequestId:\<ID>  
MaxLimit : 4194304

## Cause

There's a 4-MB limit for each call to the Azure Storage service. If your file is larger than 4 MB, you must break it in chunks. For more information, see [Azure Storage scalability and performance targets](/azure/storage/storage-scalability-targets).
