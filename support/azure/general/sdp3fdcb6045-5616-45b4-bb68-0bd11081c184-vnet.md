# [SDP3][fdcb6045-5616-45b4-bb68-0bd11081c184] Microsoft Azure Virtual Network Troubleshooter package

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Virtual Network  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2996010

## Summary

This article describes how to troubleshoot issues with Microsoft Azure virtual networks by using a troubleshooter package. This diagnostic package takes advantage of the capabilities of the Azure PowerShell module and Azure Virtual Network representational state transfer (REST) APIs to perform the following tasks:

- Identify both the Azure virtual network (VNET) and the local network experiencing the VPN issue - List only Azure VNETs that have gateways, and we show only local network connections that are specific to the selected Azure VNET. If the customer selects a VNET that has no local network connection, or if the customer has no VNETS that have gateways, the diagnostic provides the customer with links to relevant documentation.
- Network configuration XML parsing - Parses the network configuration XML and includes it in a report in order to make it easier to understand and summarize customers' configurations.
- Azure Gateway Diagnostics - Similar to [the tool we recently released for public download](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/azure-virtual-network-2b4d0793), the diagnostic package creates a three-minute Azure Gateway diagnostic file and asks the customer to turn on logging on the on-premises device and to reproduce the issue that he or she is experiencing.
- On-premises device configuration file and logging file - Prompts the customer to provide us with the device configuration and log file (after we ask the customer to reproduce the VPN issue).
- Virtual Network features configuration data collection :
  - Network Security Group (NSG)
  - Static IP (VNet and public)
  - Instance-level public IP (PIP)
  - ExpressRouteDNS (VNet, instance, and subnet level)
