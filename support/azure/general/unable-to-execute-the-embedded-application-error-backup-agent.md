# "Unable to execute the embedded application" error when you try to install the Microsoft Azure backup agent

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Backup, Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter, Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise, Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation, Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2934202

## Symptoms

When you try to install the Microsoft Azure backup agent on a server that's running Windows Server 2008 R2, the attempt fails. Additionally, you receive the following error message:

Unable to execute the embedded application to complete the installation.

> [!NOTE]
> This problem is known to occur with a virtual machine (VM) from a Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter SP1 image that was created from the image gallery. However, this same VM works as expected on Windows Server 2012.

## Cause

This problem occurs because of an issue with Microsoft .VC90.CRT. To fix the problem, you must install the previous version of the Visual C++ runtime.

When this problem occurs, the following is logged in the Application log, and this indicates that Microsoft.VC90.CRT is the problem:

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, you must install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64). Installing the latest version of the Visual C++ runtime does not fix this problem.
