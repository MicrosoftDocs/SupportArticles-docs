# Update 1603 for Cloud Platform System Standard

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Cloud Platform System  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3145162

Update 1603 for Cloud Platform System (CPS) Standard includes updates for Windows Server 2012 R2, System Center 2012 R2, and the Windows Azure Pack. It also includes functionality that lets you run a health check on the stamp before you perform an update. The list of updates is included at the bottom of this article.

## More information

CPS Standard includes the Patch and Update (P&U) Framework. This framework lets you update the infrastructure components of the CPS Standard stamp with minimal or no disruption to tenant workloads. The framework automates the installation of software, driver, and firmware updates on the physical hosts and on the infrastructure virtual machines. The P&U Framework does not update tenant virtual machines.

When the P&U Framework runs, it does the following:

- Orchestrates the updates so that they are performed in the correct order
- Automatically puts servers in and out of maintenance mode during servicing
- Validates components when servicing is complete

The P&U Framework installs approved software updates for the following products on all infrastructure hosts and virtual machines:

- Windows Server
- Windows Azure Pack
- System Center
- SQL Server

It's important that you avoid installing Windows Server, Windows Azure Pack, System Center, or SQL Server updates by any method other than the P&U Framework. You must install only those update packages that Microsoft and OEMs have tested and approved for CPS Standard.

## Known issues

### Issue 1: KBs fail to install on DPM instances

Cause: DPM instances may have a pending required reboot, and anti-malware may have prevented the installation of a patch specific to Active Directory.

Resolution: Reboot the DPM instances one at a time.

### Issue 2: Can't load NewtonSoft.json.dll

Cause: When completing, the P&U engine unloads loaded modules. During an update run that may have failed, the modules were unloaded. Therefore, PowerShell does not try to reload the modules.

Resolution: Start a new PowerShell console.

#### Issue 3: Can't load or find combinedModule.psd1

Cause: While the storage cluster is being updated, the infrastructure share may become unavailable for a brief moment while the share moves from one host to another. The error occurs if P&U tries to access a file on the share.

Resolution: Create a share for the P&U package and run P&U from the newly created share.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder on the Console virtual machine that you name PUShare.
2. Right-click the folder, and then select **Properties**.
3. On the **Sharing** tab, select **Share**.
4. Add the "Prefix"-Setup-Admins group, and allow Read/Write permissions.
5. Use this share to run P&U.
