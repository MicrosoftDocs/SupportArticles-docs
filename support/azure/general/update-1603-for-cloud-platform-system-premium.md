# Update 1603 for Cloud Platform System Premium

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Cloud Platform System  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3143326

Update 1603 for Cloud Platform System (CPS) 1.0 Premium includes updates for Windows Server 2012 R2, Microsoft System Center 2012 R2, and Windows Azure Pack. Update 1603 also includes functionality that enables you to run a Health Check on the stamp before you do an update. The list of updates is included at the end of this article. Additionally, new functionality enables you to run a compliance scan to make sure that updates are installed successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> This update package includes driver and firmware updates in addition to configuration updates.

## How to install the update

To install update 2.3 for CPS Premium 1.0, follow these steps. This update procedure assumes that you already installed Update 2.0.

### Step 1: Prepare the package

Follow the steps in the "Prepare the patching environment" section of the CPS Administrators Guide that was provided by your account team.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not start the update process. Instead, run the Health Check in the Step 2.

### Step 2: Run the Health Check and fix any issues

In the "Update the computers" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide, complete Step 1: "Run a health check and fix any discovered issues." This includes new functionality that lets you check for and disable any running backup jobs.

### Step 3: Install the prerequisite VMM hotfix before you install Update 1603

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have already installed Update 2.1 or a later version that requires the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) hotfix that is described in this step, you can skip this step. If you use a CPS 1.0 installation that has Update 2 installed, you must complete this step.

#### How to apply the private hotfix for VMM 2012 R2

The highly available Rack_Prefix-HA-VMM clustered role has two nodes: Rack_Prefix-VMM-01 and Rack_Prefix-VMM-02. In these steps, we refer to these as Node1 and Node2. To apply the VMM 2012 R2 hotfix, follow these steps:

1. Copy the HostMode_Hotfix.exe file to a folder on a Console virtual machine (VM), such as C:\HostModeHotfix.

2. Double-click the HostMode_Hotfix.exe file, review the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Yes** to accept.

3. Select a folder, such as C:\HostModeHotfix, in which to store the extracted files, and then click **OK**.

4. Determine the passive VMM node. To do this, open a Windows PowerShell ISE session, and then run the following script, where <Rack_Prefix-HA-VMM> is your stamp prefix:

    ```
    $VmmServerName = "Rack_Prefix-HA-VMM" $vmmServer = Get-SCVMMServer -ComputerName $VmmServerName $activeNode = $vmmServer.ActiveVMMNode $passiveNodes = @() $vmmServer.FailoverVMMNodes | ForEach- Object { if($.ToLower() -ne $activeNode.ToLower()){ $passiveNodes += $ } } $passiveNodes
    " $vmmServer = Get-SCVMMServer -ComputerName $VmmServerName $activeNode = $vmmServer.ActiveVMMNode $passiveNodes = @() $vmmServer.FailoverVMMNodes | ForEach- Object { if($.ToLower() -ne $activeNode.ToLower()){ $passiveNodes += $ } } $passiveNodes
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > This script returns the server name of the passive VMM node. (In our example, we assume that Node2 is the passive node at first.)
5. In File Explorer, locate the following folder on the passive node:

    ```
    \\Rack_Prefix-VMM-0#>\c$\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\Virtual Machine Manager\bin 
    ```

6. Make backup copies of the following files in the \bin folder:

    - Engine.Common.dll
    - Utils.dll
7. In the VMM console, determine on which host (in the management cluster) the passive VMM node is running.
8. Open Hyper-V Manager, connect to the management cluster host that you identified in step 4, and connect to the passive VMM node.

9. On the VMM node, type powershell to open an elevated Windows PowerShell session, and then run the following command:

    ```
    Stop-Service SCVMMService Stop-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

10. Verify that the services have stopped. To do this, run the following command:

    ```
    Get-Service SCVMMService Get-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

    Verify that the status of each is **Stopped**. If you're prompted to close the System Center Management Service Host process, click **Ignore**.
11. On the Console VM, locate the following folder on the passive node:

    ```
    \\Rack_Prefix-VMM-0#>\c$\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\Virtual Machine Manager\bin
    ```

12. In the \bin folder, replace the following files by using the new versions of the files that you extracted from the hotfix package:

    - Engine.Common.dll
    - Utils.dll
13. On the passive VMM node, run the following command to start the services:

    ```
    Start-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The SCVMMService service does not start when the passive VMM server node is not active. The SCVMMService starts only when the node becomes the active node. This behavior is by design.
14. In Failover Cluster Manager, start a failover. This makes Node1 the new passive node and Node2 (which has already been updated) the active node.
15. Open Failover Cluster Manager, and then connect to the -CL-VMM cluster.
16. Click **Roles**. The **Roles** pane displays the active node in the **Owner Node** column.
17. Right-click the active node, point to **Move**, and then click **Select Node**.
18. Select the other node, and make sure that the status changes to **Running** for the new active node. This may take several seconds.
19. Follow steps 7-13 to update the VMM files on the new passive node (in this example, Node1).

#### How to revert the update

To revert the update installation (if it's necessary), follow these steps:

1. On the passive VMM node, stop the SCVMMService service, and then stop the SCVMMAgent service.
2. Replace the files in your Virtual Machine Manager Install folder by using your backup files.
3. Start the SCVMMAgent service.
4. Start the SCVMMService service.
5. In Failover Cluster Manager, start a failover of the -HA-VMM clustered role.
6. Repeat steps 1-4 on the new passive node.

### Step 4: Run the P&U update package

In the "Update the computers" section of the CPS Administrators Guide, follow "Step 2: Apply the P&U update package" and "Step 3: Post-update clean up" to apply Update 1603.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in Update 1603, the Microsoft Patch and Update Framework (P&U) automatically runs a health check as part of the update process. You can control what happens if critical Operations Manager alerts are discovered. To do this, change the value of the -ScomAlertAction parameter. See the Administrators Guide for more information.

After the update installation is complete, remember to enable DPM agents if you disabled them earlier (as described in the Administrators Guide).

### Step 5: Run an optional compliance scan

To run a compliance scan, pass the following flag:

```
\\SU1_InfrastructureShare1<CPSPU Folder Name>\Framework\PatchingUpgrade\Invoke-PURun.ps1 -PUCredential $cred -ComplianceScanOnly
```

> [!NOTE]
> The compliance scan output is written to the location where the update package was extracted. For example, the scan is written to "PURoot"\MissingUpdates.json.

### Step 6: Update network switch firmware

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only customers who run CPS Premium with 2014 hardware (S4810 and S55 switches) have to update switch firmware for Update 1603.

To update the network switch firmware, follow the steps in the "Update network switch firmware" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide.

### Step 7: Update the F5 load balancer firmware

To update the network switch firmware, follow the steps in the "Update F5 load balancer firmware" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide.
