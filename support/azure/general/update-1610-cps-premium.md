# Update 1610 for Cloud Platform System (CPS) Premium

This article describes Update 1610 for Cloud Platform System (CPS) Premium and provides detailed steps to install Update 1610 for CPS Premium.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Cloud Platform System  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3200950

## Summary

Update 1610 for Cloud Platform System (CPS) Premium includes updates for Windows Server, Microsoft System Center, Microsoft SQL Server, and hardware components. This update includes the contents of Updates 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608, and 1609. It also contains the following components:

- 1610-0 Update: This includes two updates that are required for Windows servicing. These updates were previously released in Updates 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608, and 1609.
- 1610-1 Update: This is the main package. It contains four new Windows updates and System Center Endpoint Protection antivirus definitions, plus the updates that were previously released in Updates 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608, and 1609.
- An update for Dell Active Fabric Manager (AFM) and the corresponding switch firmware updates (that were included in Update 1608).

> [!NOTE]
> Update 1603 is a prerequisite for installing Update 1610. Update 1610 is a rollup update that also contains the payload from Updates 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608, and 1609. You do not have to have Update 1605, 1606, 1607, 1608, or 1609 installed to install Update 1610.

## More information

To install Update 1610 for CPS Premium, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
>
>- This procedure assumes that Update 1603 is already installed.
>- For any references to the CPS Premium Administrators Guide, refer to the update version that is provided by your account team.

### Step 1: Update network switch firmware

A new AFM firmware update was released for Update 1609. If you applied the network switch firmware updates for 1608, you have to install only the AFM update. If you skipped Update 1608, you should install the AFM update and also update the network switches to the recommended firmware versions. If you applied both the network switch firmware from 1608 and the updated AFM from 1609, you can skip these steps because this content has not changed for Update 1610.

Follow the steps in the "Update network switch firmware" section of the "1609" version of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide that was provided by your account team. Do not use the instructions from an earlier version of the Administrators Guide.

For the download location of the AFM files for Update 1610, see [https://poweredgec.dell.com/cps/CPS_P_1611/Tools/AFM/](https://poweredgec.dell.com/cps/CPS_P_1611/Tools/AFM/).

AFM will be updated to version 2.1(0.0)P2. The following table lists the recommended firmware versions that switches should run after the update.

|Device|Recommended firmware version|CPS Premium hardware version|
|---|---|---|
|S4048|9.10(0.1)P8|2016|
|S3048|9.10(0.1)P8|2016|
|S4810|9.10(0.1)P8|2014|
|S55|8.3.5.6|2014|
  
### Step 2: Update serial port concentrator firmware

> [!NOTE]
> This is the same update that was originally released as part of Update 1607. If you made this update when you applied Update 1607, you do not have to be make it again.

Follow the steps in the "Update serial port concentrator firmware" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide that was provided by your account team.

Download the following:

- Avocent ACS 6000 Series
- [Digi CM 48](https://ftp1.digi.com/support/firmware/80007070_u.bin)

The following table lists the recommended firmware versions that the serial port concentrator should run after the update.

|Device|Recommended firmware version|CPS Premium hardware version|
|---|---|---|
|Avocent ACS 6000 Series|3.3.0.10|2016|
|Digi CM 48|1.9.5.3|2014|
  
### Step 3: Install the VMM hotfixes for VM placement

- If you installed the VMM hotfix for virtual machine (VM) placement that was included in Update 1606, 1607, 1608, or 1609, you do not have to install it again. If this is true, you can skip this step and go to Step 4.
- The highly available VMM clustered role (**\<Prefix>** -HA-VMM) has two nodes, **\<Prefix>** -VMM-01 and **\<Prefix>** -VMM-02. In these steps, we refer to these as Node1 and Node2.

To install the VMM hotfixes, follow these steps:

1. For the new VMM placement hotfix, follow these steps:
    1. From the update file drop location, copy the Placement_HF_UR9.exe file to a folder on a Console VM, such as `C:\VMMHotfix`.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You can use the same folder that was used for the previous hotfix.

    2. Double-click the Placement_HF_UR9.exe file, review the End User License Agreement (EULA), and then click **Yes** to accept the terms.
    3. Select a folder in which to store the extracted files. For example, select `C:\VMMHotfix`. Then, click **OK**.
2. Determine the passive VMM node. To do this, open a Windows PowerShell ISE session, and then run the following script:

    ```powershell
    $prefix = $ENV:COMPUTERNAME.split('-')[0]
    $VmmServerName = "$prefix-HA-VMM"
    $vmmServer = Get-SCVMMServer -ComputerName $VmmServerName
    $activeNode = $vmmServer.ActiveVMMNode
    $passiveNodes = @() $vmmServer.FailoverVMMNodes | ForEach-Object { if($_.ToLower() -ne $activeNode.ToLower()){ $passiveNodes += $_ } }
    Write-Host "Active Node: $activeNode" -ForegroundColor GreenWrite-Host "Passive Node: $passiveNodes" -ForegroundColor Green
    ```

    This script returns the server name of the passive VMM node. (In our example, we assume that Node2 is the default passive node.)
3. In File Explorer, locate the following folder on the passive node:`\\<Prefix>-VMM-0#>\c$\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\Virtual Machine Manager\bin`
4. Make a backup copy of the following file in the \bin folder:
`Engine.Placement.ResourceModel.dll`.
5. In the VMM console, determine which host (in the management cluster) the passive VMM node is running on.
6. Open Hyper-V Manager, connect to the management cluster host that you identified in the step 5, and then connect to the passive VMM node.
7. On the VMM node, type `powershell` to open an elevated Windows PowerShell session, and then run the following commands:

    ```powershell
    Stop-Service SCVMMService

    Stop-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

8. Verify that the services have stopped. To do this, run the following commands:

    ```console
    Get-Service SCVMMService

    Get-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you are prompted to close the System Center Management Service Host process, click **Ignore**.
9. On the Console VM, locate the following folder on the passive node:`\\<Prefix>-VMM-0#\c$\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\Virtual Machine Manager\bin`
10. In the \bin folder, replace the following file by using the new version of the file that you extracted from the hotfix package: `Engine.Placement.ResourceModel.dll`.
11. On the passive VMM node, run the following command to start the VMM Agent service:

    ```powershell
    Start-Service SCVMMAgent
    ```  

    > [!NOTE]
    > The SCVMMService service does not start if the passive VMM server node is not active. SCVMMService starts only when the node becomes the Active node. This behavior is by design.
12. In Failover Cluster Manager, start a failover. This will set Node1 as the new passive node and set Node2 (which has already been updated) as the active node.
13. Open Failover Cluster Manager, and then connect to the **\<Prefix>** -CL-VMM cluster.
14. Click **Roles**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Roles** pane displays the active node in the **Owner Node** column.

15. Right-click the active node, point to **Move**, and then click **Select Node**.
16. Select the other node, and make sure that the status changes to **Running** for the new active node.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The change may take several seconds to occur.

17. Follow steps 5-11 to update the VMM file on the new passive node (in this example, Node1).

#### Revert the update (if necessary)

If you must revert the update, follow these steps:

1. On the passive VMM node, stop the SCVMMAgent service.
2. Replace the files under your Virtual Machine Manager Install folder by using your backup files.
3. Start the SCVMMAgent service.
4. In Failover Cluster Manager, start a failover of the **\<Prefix>** -HA-VMM clustered role.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 on the new passive node.

### Step 4: Prepare the package

Follow the steps in the "Prepare the patching environment" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide that was provided by your account team.

Extract both the 1610-0 and 1610-1 updates, and then put them into different folders on the Infrastructure share.

Information about the firmware download steps is in the "1609" version of the Administrators Guide in on page 183 of the "Step 3: Add the firmware and driver updates to the P&U package (if stamp not connected to internet)" section. Even if these updates were already applied, the payload must be put into the downloaded location per the Administrators Guide. Because this payload has not been changed since Update 1607, you can use the payload that is already downloaded, or download it new, per the Administrators guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not start the update process. Instead, run the health check that is described in Step 6.

### Step 5: Clean up the WSUS server

To clean up the WSUS server, follow these steps:

1. On the Console VM, open the Windows Server Update Services console.
2. Right-click **Update Services**, click **Connect to Server**, and then connect to the WSUS VM (**\<Prefix>** -SUS-01).
3. In the navigation pane, expand **Update Services** > [ **WSUS Server** ] > **Updates**, and then click **All Updates**.
4. In the **All Updates** pane, click **Any except declined** in the **Approval** list.
5. In the **Status** list, click **Any**, and then click **Refresh**.
6. Select all updates.
7. Right-click the selection, and then click **Decline**.
8. In the navigation pane, expand the server name, and then click **Options**.
9. In the **Options** pane, click **Server Cleanup Wizard**.
10. Select all check boxes except the **Computers not contacting the server** check box.
11. Click **Next**.

### Step 6: Run the Patch & Update Health Check and fix discovered issues

In the "Update the computers" section of the CPS Premium Administrators Guide, complete "Step 1: Run a health check and fix any discovered issues." This includes functionality to check for and disable any running backup jobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not start the update process. Instead, run the health check, fix any discovered issues, and stop any running backup jobs.

### Step 7: Run P&U update package 1610-0

In the "Update the computers" section of the CPS Administrators Guide, follow "Step 2: Apply the P&U update package" to apply Update 1610-0.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting in Update 1603, the Patch and Update (P&U) engine automatically runs a health check as part of the update process. You can control what happens if you discover any critical Operations Manager alerts. To do this, change the value of the -ScomAlertAction parameter. For more information, see the Administrators Guide.

Because of the size of this package, estimates for deployment are 12-18 hours.

If you do not intend to apply 1610-1 immediately, remember to enable DPM agents if you disabled them earlier (as described in the Administrators Guide).

Also, if you do not intend to apply 1610-1 immediately, follow the steps in "Step 3: Post-update clean up" of the Administrators Guide after the updating is completed.

### Step 8: Run P&U update package 1610-1

Follow the same steps for installing the 1610-1 package. This can be scheduled right after the 1610-0 package or later, depending on your maintenance timeframe requirements.

Because of the size of this package, estimates for deployment are 36-48 hours (per rack).

After the patching process is complete, remember to enable DPM agents if you disabled them earlier (as described in the Administrators Guide). Also, follow the steps in "Step 3: Post-update clean up" of the Administrators Guide after the updating is completed.

### Step 9: Run an optional compliance scan

To run a compliance scan, pass the following flag:

```
\\SU1_InfrastructureShare1<CPSPU FolderName>\Framework\PatchingUpgrade\Invoke-PURun.ps1 -PUCredential $cred -ComplianceScanOnly
```

The compliance scan output is written to the following location to which the update package was extracted:

`<PURoot>\MissingUpdates.json`

#### Updates for SQL Server 2012 (from previous updates)

|KB article|Description|
|---|---|
| [3072779](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3072779)|SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 3 release information|
  
## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1

The SQLProductUpdates subsystem fails and returns the following error message:

> The WS-Management service cannot complete the operation within the time specified in OperationTimeout.

### Description

There seems to be a timing issue in the service. Microsoft is currently researching this issue. This can cause SQLProductUpdates to fail and return an error message that resembles the following:

> The Microsoft.HotfixPlugin plug-in reported a failure while attempting to install updates on node "". Additional information reported by the plug-in: (ClusterUpdateException) There was a failure in a Common Information Model (CIM) operation, that is, an operation performed by software that Cluster-Aware Updating depends on. The computer was "", and the operation was "RunUpdateInstaller[,CauNodeWCD[]]". The failure was: (CimException) The WS-Management service cannot complete the operation within the time specified in OperationTimeout. HRESULT 0x80338029 ==> (CimException) The WS-Management service cannot complete the operation within the time specified in OperationTimeout. HRESULT 0x80338029

> [!NOTE]
> Although the Patch and Update (P&U) process fails while it waits for the action to finish, the underlying Cluster-Aware Updating (CAU) process succeeds.

### Detection

Verify that CAU succeeded. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Console VM, open **Cluster-Aware Updating**.
2. In the **Connect to a failover cluster** list, click the SQL Server cluster (< **Prefix** >-HA-SQL), and then click **Connect**.
3. The **Last Run** status should show a **Succeeded** value for all four SQL Server nodes.

Verify the SQL Server version. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to the **\<Prefix>** -SH-SQL\SCSHAREDDB instance.
3. Click **New Query**.
4. Run the following command:

    ```
    SELECT @@VERSION
    ```  

5. The result should begin as follows:

    ```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (SP3) (KB3072779) - 11.0.6020.0 (X64)
    ```

    Or as follows:

    ```
    Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (SP3-CU2) (KB3137746) - 11.0.6523.0 (X64)
    ```

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for the following SQL Server instances:

    - **\<Prefix>** -OM-SQL\SCOMDB
    - **\<Prefix>** -KT-SQL\KATALDB
    - **\<Prefix>** -DW-SQL\CPSDW
    - **\<Prefix>** -AS-SQL\CPSSSAS

### Resolution

If the CAU status displays a **Succeeded** value for all nodes, and if version information for all instances is correct, restart the P&U process, and then add "SQLProductUpdates" to the -ExcludeSubsystems parameter array.

If the CAU status does not display a **Succeeded** value for all nodes, or if version information for all instances is correct, restart the P&U process, and make no change in the parameters.

If the process fails again, escalate the case through your usual support channels.

### Issue 2

The VMM "Perform servicing on a Service" job fails.

### Description

Occasionally, servicing jobs fail because of communication issues that occur between the VMM server and its agents.

### Detection

In the VMM console, look for one or more failed "Perform servicing on a Service" jobs. The error may resemble the following example:

> Error (22655)
>
> VMM is unable to retrieve status from computer
>
> Recommended Action
>
> Check if the computer is running and the VM guest agent is in a healthy state.

### Resolution

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. In the VMM console, commit the template for the affected service. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Navigate to **VMs and Services**.
   2. In the navigation pane, select **All Hosts**.
   3. In the top ribbon, select **Services**.
   4. Right-click the affected service, and then select **Commit Template**.
2. Restart the P&U process.
