# Azure Batch task fails without stdout or stderr

This article provides the cause and some suggestions for an Azure Batch task failure without stdout or stderr.

## Symptoms

Batch tasks fail with an exit code. But there are no standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Batch automatically captures and writes stdout and stderr for the task into the *stdout.txt* or *stderr.txt* file in the task directory.

## Cause  

When a task executes a process, the Batch service populates the task's exit code property with the return code of the process. If the process returns a non-zero exit code, the Batch service marks the task as failed.

The Batch service doesn't determine a task's exit code. The process, or the operating system on which it was executed, determines the exit code.

## Recommended steps

Try to determine why the process fails based on the exit code.

If it's hard to identify the cause based on the exit code, perform more debugging by following these steps:

1. Use the Azure portal to download a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file for Windows nodes or obtain Secure Shell (SSH) connection information for Linux nodes.

1. Manually run the command or script used to run the failed task for debugging.
