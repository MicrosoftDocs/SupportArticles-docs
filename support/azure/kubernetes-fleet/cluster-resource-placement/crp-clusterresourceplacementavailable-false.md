# Resource propagation failure: ClusterResourcePlacementAvailable is False

This article discusses how to troubleshoot `ClusterResourcePlacementAvailable` issues when you propagate resources by using the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object API in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager.

## Symptoms

When you use the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager to propagate resources, the deployment fails. The `ClusterResourcePlacementAvailable` status shows as `False`.

## Cause

This issue might occur because of one of the following reasons:

- The member cluster doesn't have enough resource availability.
- The deployment contains an invalid image name.

## Case study

The following example shows that `ClusterResourcePlacement` doesn't propagate a deployment to a member cluster because of an invalid image name.

#### ClusterResourcePlacement specifications

```YAML
apiVersion: placement.kubernetes-fleet.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterResourcePlacement
metadata:
  name: crp
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - group: ""
      kind: Namespace
      name: test-ns
      version: v1
  policy:
    placementType: PickN
    numberOfClusters: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
```

#### ClusterResourcePlacement status

 ```
In the `failedPlacements` section for `kind-cluster-1`, the `message` field explains why the resource wasn't applied on the member cluster. In the preceding `conditions` section, the `Applied` condition for `kind-cluster-1` is flagged as `false` and shows the `NotAllWorkHaveBeenApplied` reason. This indicates that the `Work` object that's intended for the member cluster `kind-cluster-1` wasn't applied. For more information, see [How to find the correct Work resource associated with `ClusterResourcePlacement`](troubleshoot-clusterresourceplacement-api-issues.md#find-work).

Check the `Available` status for `kind-cluster-1`. You can see that the `my-deployment` deployment isn't yet available on the member cluster. This suggests that an issue might be affecting the deployment manifest.

### Resolution

In this situation, a potential solution is to check the deployment in the member cluster because the message indicates that the root cause of the issue is a bad image name. After this image name is identified, you can correct the deployment manifest and update it. After you fix and update the resource manifest, the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object API automatically propagates the corrected resource to the member cluster.

For all other situations, make sure that the propagated resource is configured correctly. Additionally, verify that the selected cluster has sufficient available capacity to accommodate the new resources.
