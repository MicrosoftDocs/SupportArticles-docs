# Resource propagation failure: ClusterResourcePlacementWorkSynchronized is false

This article describes how to troubleshoot `ClusterResourcePlacementWorkSynchronized` issues when you propagate resources using the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager.

## Symptoms

When using the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager to propagate resources, if the `ClusterResourcePlacement` is updated, the associated work objects aren't synchronized with the changes, and the `ClusterResourcePlacementWorkSynchronized` condition status shows as `False`.

> [!NOTE]
> To get more information about why the work object synchronization fails, you can check the [work generator controller](https://github.com/Azure/fleet/blob/main/pkg/controllers/workgenerator/controller.go) logs.

## Cause

This issue might occur for one of the following reasons:

- The controller encounters an error while trying to generate the corresponding work object.
- The enveloped object isn't well formatted.

## Case study

In the following example, the `ClusterResourcePlacement` is trying to propagate a resource to a selected cluster, but the work object isn't updated to reflect the latest changes because the selected cluster has been terminated.

### ClusterResourcePlacement specification

```yaml
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: secret-reader
      version: v1
  policy:
    placementType: PickN
    numberOfClusters: 1
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
 ```

### ClusterResourcePlacement status

      message: 'Failed to synchronize the work to the latest: works.placement.kubernetes-fleet.io
        "crp1-work" is forbidden: unable to create new content in namespace fleet-member-kind-cluster-1

      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: SyncWorkFailed
      status: "False"
      type: WorkSynchronized
  selectedResources:
  - kind: Namespace
    name: test-ns
    version: v1
```

In the `ClusterResourcePlacement` status, the `ClusterResourcePlacementWorkSynchronized` condition status shows as `False`. The message for it indicates that the work object `crp1-work` is prohibited from generating new content within the namespace `fleet-member-kind-cluster-1` because it's currently terminating.

### Resolution

In this situation, here are several potential solutions:

- Modify the `ClusterResourcePlacement` with a newly selected cluster. 
- Delete the `ClusterResourcePlacement` to remove the work through garbage collection.
- Rejoin the member cluster. The namespace can only be regenerated after rejoining the cluster.

In other situations, you might opt to wait for the work to finish propagating.
