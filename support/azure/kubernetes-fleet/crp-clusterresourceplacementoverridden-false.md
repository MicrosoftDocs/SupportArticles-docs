# Resource propagation failure: ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden is False

This article discusses how to troubleshoot `ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden` issues when you propagate resources by using the `ClusterResourcePlacement` object API in Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager.

## Symptoms

When you use the `ClusterResourcePlacement` API object in Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager to propagate resources, the deployment fails. The `clusterResourcePlacementOverridden` status shows as `False`.

## Cause

This issue might occur because the `ClusterResourceOverride` or `ResourceOverride` is created by using an invalid field path for the resource.

## Case study

In the following example, an attempt is made to override the cluster role `secret-reader` that is propagated by the `ClusterResourcePlacement` to the selected clusters.
However, the `ClusterResourceOverride` is created by using an invalid path for the resource.

### ClusterRole

```YAML
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
annotations:
kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
{"apiVersion":"rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1","kind":"ClusterRole","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"secret-reader"},"rules":[{"apiGroups":[""],"resources":["secrets"],"verbs":["get","watch","list"]}]}
creationTimestamp: "2024-05-14T15:36:48Z"
name: secret-reader
resourceVersion: "81334"
uid: 108e6312-3416-49be-aa3d-a665c5df58b4
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
    resources:
  - secrets
    verbs:
  - get
  - watch
  - list
```
The `ClusterRole` `secret-reader` that is propagated to the member clusters by the `ClusterResourcePlacement`.

### ClusterResourceOverride specifications
```YAML
spec:
  clusterResourceSelectors:
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: secret-reader
    version: v1
  policy:
    overrideRules:
    - clusterSelector:
        clusterSelectorTerms:
        - labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              env: canary
      jsonPatchOverrides:
      - op: add
        path: /metadata/labels/new-label
        value: new-value
```
The `ClusterResourceOverride` is created to override the `ClusterRole` `secret-reader` by adding a new label (`new-label`)
that has the value `new-value` for the clusters that have the label `env: canary`.

### ClusterResourcePlacement specifications
```YAML
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
    - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: secret-reader
      version: v1
  policy:
    placementType: PickN
    numberOfClusters: 1
    affinity:
      clusterAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          clusterSelectorTerms:
            - labelSelector:
                matchLabels:
                  env: canary
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    applyStrategy:
      allowCoOwnership: true
```

### ClusterResourcePlacement Status:
```Output

      message: 'Failed to apply the override rules on the resources: add operation

      observedGeneration: 1
      reason: OverriddenFailed
      status: "False"
      type: Overridden
  selectedResources:
  - group: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    kind: ClusterRole
    name: secret-reader
    version: v1
```

If the `ClusterResourcePlacementOverridden` condition is `False`, check the `placementStatuses` section to get the exact cause of the failure.

In this situation, the message indicates that the override failed because the path `/metadata/labels/new-label` and its corresponding value are missing.
Based on the previous example of the cluster role `secret-reader`, you can see that the path `/metadata/labels/` doesn't exist. This means that `labels` doesn't exist.
Therefore, a new label can't be added.

### Resolution

To successfully override the cluster role `secret-reader`, correct the path and value in `ClusterResourceOverride`, as shown in the following code:

```
jsonPatchOverrides:
  - op: add
    path: /metadata/labels
    value: 
      newlabel: new-value
```

This adds the new label `newlabel` that has the value `new-value` to the ClusterRole `secret-reader`.
