# Troubleshoot Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager DNS load balancing

This article provides troubleshooting information for Azure Kubernetes Fleet Manager's DNS-based load balancing. Fleet Manager DNS load balancing uses Azure Traffic Manager to balance traffic across public endpoints from multiple AKS member clusters.

## Use Fleet Manager hub cluster to troubleshoot

1. User should have access to the Azure subscription and resource group where the Azure Traffic Manager profile is created.
2. [Install or upgrade Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to version `2.72.0` or later.
3. Make sure that the Kubernetes [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) command-line tool is installed. You can install kubectl by running the [az aks install-cli](/cli/azure/aks#az-aks-install-cli) command.
4. Install the **fleet** Azure CLI extension using the `az extension add`command, making sure your version is at least `1.5.2`.

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az extension add --name fleet
    ```

5. Access to the Fleet Manager hub cluster Kubernetes API. For more information, see [Access the Fleet Manager hub cluster API](/azure/kubernetes-fleet/access-fleet-hub-cluster-kubernetes-api).

## Scenario 1: TrafficManagerProfile or Traffic Manager can't be created

This section provides common reasons and solutions for the `TrafficManagerProfile` Kubernetes object and its associated Azure Traffic Manager resource not being created scenarios.

To determine the appropriate resolution, check the status of the `TrafficManagerProfile` object on the Fleet Manager hub cluster for the error message.

```bash
kubectl get trafficmanagerprofile -n <namespace> <profile-name> -o yaml
```

### Error 1: The client does not have authorization to perform action 

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is met:

* A nonexistent Azure resource group was specified in the `TrafficManagerProfile` manifest.
* The resource group isn't the same Azure Subscription as the Fleet Manager resource.
* The Fleet Manager hub cluster identity doesn't have permission to create and manage Azure Traffic Manager profiles in the specified resource group.

You can check The `TrafficManagerProfile` status for details of the error. The following is the example of the TrafficManagerProfile status that shows the insufficient permissions issue.

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T02:57:33Z"
    message: |
      Invalid profile: GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/your-fleet-atm-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/trafficmanagerprofiles/fleet-yyyy
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      RESPONSE 403: 403 Forbidden
      ERROR CODE: AuthorizationFailed
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      {
        "error": {
          "code": "AuthorizationFailed",
          "message": "The client 'xxx' with object id 'xxx' does not have authorization to perform action 
          'Microsoft.Network/trafficmanagerprofiles/read' over scope 
          '/subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/your-fleet-atm-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/trafficmanagerprofiles/fleet-yyyy' or the 
          scope is invalid. If access was recently granted, please refresh your credentials."
        }
      }
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    observedGeneration: 1
    reason: Invalid
    status: "False"
    type: Programmed
```
  
#### Solution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the Azure resource group exists and is the same Azure Subscription as the Fleet Manager.
2. Check the Fleet Manager hub cluster identity has been granted the `Traffic Manager Contributor` role scoped to the resource group. For more information, see [Configure Fleet Manager permissions](/azure/kubernetes-fleet/howto-dns-load-balancing#configure-fleet-manager-permissions).

### Error 2: Domain name is not available

This issue may occur if the DNS prefix generated is already in use by another Azure Traffic Manager profile. The DNS prefix consists of the namespace and the `metadata.name` field in the `TrafficManagerProfile` manifest. For example, if the namespace is `team-a` and the `metadata.name` is `webapp`, the DNS prefix would `team-a-webapp`.

The following is the example of the TrafficManagerProfile status that shows the Domain name is not available issue.

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T06:39:10Z"
    message: Domain name is not available. Please choose a different profile name or namespace
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: DNSNameNotAvailable
    status: "False"
    type: Programmed
```

#### Solution

To resolve this issue, use `nslookup` or a similar tool to check if the full DNS name ( for example `team-a-webapp.trafficmanager.net`) is available.  If itâ€˜s not available, consider one of the following solutions:

- Change the `metadata.name` field in the `TrafficManagerProfile` manifest to a unique name.
- Use a different namespace for the `TrafficManagerProfile` manifest. This impacts the `TrafficManagerBackend` and `ServiceExport` objects, which must be in the same namespace.

### Error 3: Azure Traffic Manager subscription limits reached

This issue may occur if more than 200 Traffic Manager Profiles or Endpoints within a single Azure Subscription.

The following is the example of the TrafficManagerProfile status that shows the Azure Traffic Manager profile limits reached issue.

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T06:39:10Z"
    message: Azure Traffic Manager profile limits reached.
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Invalid
    status: "False"
    type: Programmed
```
#### Solution

Consider to delete unused profiles or requesting an increase in the limit. For more information, see [Azure Traffic Manager limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-traffic-manager-limits).

### Error 4: Azure Traffic Manager returns an error

This issue may occur if the Azure Traffic Manager service returns an error when creating the profile.

The following is the example of the TrafficManagerProfile status that shows this error.

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T06:39:10Z"
    message: Azure Traffic Manager error message is displayed here.
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Invalid
    status: "False"
    type: Programmed
```

#### Solution

If the error persists, check the Azure Traffic Manager service health.

## Scenario 2: TrafficManagerBackend can't be created

This section provides common causes and recommended solutions for scenarios that the TrafficManagerBackend Kubernetes can't be created.

To determine the appropriate resolution, check the status of the `TrafficManagerBackend` object on the Fleet Manager hub cluster for the error message.

```bash
kubectl get trafficmanagerbackend -n <namespace> <backend-name> -o yaml
```

### Error 1: TrafficManagerProfile is not found or Invalid trafficManagerProfile

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is met:

- The `TrafficManagerBackend` was created in a different namespace than the `TrafficManagerProfile`.
- The `TrafficManagerProfile` object exists, but the associated Azure Traffic Manager resource couldn't be found.

The following are the examples of the TrafficManagerBackend status that shows this error.
  
```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T06:43:57Z"
  message: TrafficManagerProfile "nginx-nginx-profile" is not found
  observedGeneration: 1
  reason: Invalid
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
```

Missing Azure Traffic Manager resource.

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T07:00:04Z"
  message: 'Invalid trafficManagerProfile "nginx-nginx-profile": Domain name is not available. 
  Please choose a different profile name or namespace'
  observedGeneration: 1
  reason: Invalid
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
```

### Solution

* Make sure to create the `TrafficManagerBackend` in the same namespace as the `TrafficManagerProfile`.
* Ensure that the `Programmed` condition of `TrafficManagerProfile` is `Accepted`. If not, check the profile definition for validity and resubmit.
* Ensure the Azure Traffic Manager resource exists. To recreate the resource, delete the `TrafficManagerProfile` from the Fleet Manager hub cluster and reapply it.

### Error 2: Invalid Service or ServiceExport

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is met:

- The `Service` was created in a different namespace than the `TrafficManagerBackend`.
- The `Service` exists, but the `ServiceExport` was not created in the same namespace as the `TrafficManagerBackend`.
- The `Service` isn't defined as a `LoadBalancer` type.
- The `Service` isn't exposed via an Azure public IP address or doesn't have a DNS name assigned.

The following are the examples of the TrafficManagerBackend status that shows the errors:

```yml
status:
conditions:
- lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T07:50:49Z"
  message: ServiceImport "invalid-service" is not found
  observedGeneration: 1
  reason: Invalid
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
```

The `Service` is not defined as a `LoadBalancer` type.

```yml
status:
conditions:
- lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T07:56:05Z"
  message: '1 service(s) exported from clusters cannot be exposed as the Azure
    Traffic Manager, for example, service exported from aks-member-5 is invalid:
    unsupported service type "ClusterIP"'
  observedGeneration: 1
  reason: Invalid
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
```

### Solution

* Ensure at least one `Service` of a member cluster is exported in the same namespace of the `TrafficManagerBackend` by creating `ServiceExport`.
* Ensure that the exported `Service` is load balancer type and exposed via an Azure public IP address, which must have a DNS name assigned to be used in a Traffic Manager profile.

### Error 3: Azure Traffic Manager profile is not found

This issue may occur if one of the following conditions is met:

- The `TrafficManagerProfile` was object exists, but the associated Azure Traffic Manager resource couldn't be found.
- The Fleet Manager hub cluster identity doesn't have permission to create and manage Azure Traffic Manager profiles or endpoints in the specified resource group.

The following is the example of the TrafficManagerBackend status that shows the error:

```yml
status:
conditions:
- lastTransitionTime: "2025-05-08T09:38:36Z"
  message: Azure Traffic Manager profile "fleet-6dd24764-0e46-4b52-b9c6-cc2a3f2535f9" under "your-fleet-atm-rg" is not found
  observedGeneration: 2
  reason: Invalid
  status: "False"
  type: Accepted
```

### Solution

* Ensure the Azure Traffic Manager resource exists. To recreate the resource, delete the `TrafficManagerProfile` from the Fleet Manager hub cluster and reapply it.
* Check the Fleet Manager hub cluster identity has been granted the `Traffic Manager Contributor` role scoped to the resource group. For more information, see [Configure Fleet Manager permissions](/azure/kubernetes-fleet/howto-dns-load-balancing#configure-fleet-manager-permissions).

### Error 4: Azure Traffic Manager profile limits reached

This issue may occur if more than 200 Azure Traffic Manager Endpoints would be created within a single Azure Subscription.

The following is the example of the TrafficManagerBackend status that shows the error:

```yml
status:
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2025-04-29T06:39:10Z"
    message: Azure Traffic Manager profile limits reached.
    observedGeneration: 2
    reason: Invalid
    status: "False"
    type: Programmed
```

#### Solution

Consider deleting unused endpoints. For more information, see [Azure Traffic Manager limits](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#azure-traffic-manager-limits).

## Use Azure Log Analytics to troubleshoot

In addition to querying the Fleet Manager hub cluster, you can use Azure Log Analytics for troubleshooting. 

### TrafficManagerProfile

Filter entries in the `fleet-hub-net-controller-manager` category using `trafficmanagerprofile/controller.go`.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "fleet-hub-net-controller-manager"
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceId, log_s
| where ResourceId == "/subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/your-fleet-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets/your-fleet"
| where log_s contains "trafficmanagerprofile/controller.go"
| limit 1000
```

### TrafficManagerBackend

Filter entries in the `fleet-hub-net-controller-manager` category using `trafficmanagerbackend/controller.go`.

```kusto
AzureDiagnostics
| where Category == "fleet-hub-net-controller-manager"
| project TimeGenerated, ResourceId, log_s
| where ResourceId == "/subscriptions/xxx/resourceGroups/your-fleet-rg/providers/Microsoft.ContainerService/fleets/your-fleet"
| where log_s contains "trafficmanagerbackend/controller.go"
| limit 1000
```
