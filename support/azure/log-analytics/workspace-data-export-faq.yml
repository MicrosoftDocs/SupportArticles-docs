summary: This article answers frequently asked questions (FAQ) about how to export data from a Microsoft Azure Log Analytics workspace.
sections:
  - name: General
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I learn more about how to export data from a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          See [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export).

      - question: |
          How can I learn about the limitations of this feature?
        answer: |
          See the [Limitations](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#limitations) section in [Log Analytics workspace data export in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export).

      - question: |
          Why did my data not get exported?
        answer: |
          If the data export rule includes an unsupported table, the configuration will succeed, but data won't be exported for that table. If the table is later supported, then its data will be exported at that time.

      - question: |
          How can I learn whether my table is supported?
        answer: |
          Check the list of [supported tables for workspace data export](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#supported-tables).

      - question: |
          Why am I seeing a "Table does not exist in the workspace" error message?
        answer: |
          If the data export rule includes a table that doesn't exist, the export fails, and it generates that error message.

      - question: |
          How can I find the data export rules that are configured for the workspace?
        answer: |
          In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), search for and select **Log Analytics workspaces**, and then select your workspace from the workspace list. In the workspace menu pane, in the **Settings** section, select **Data Export**. The list of data export rules appears. Each entry displays the rule name, destination type, and status (**Enabled** or **Disabled**).

          To view all data export rules in a workspace in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli), use the [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export list](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-list) command:

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export list \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name>
          ```

      - question: |
          How can I disable an export rule?
        answer: |
          You can disable an export rule to stop the export if you don't have to retain data for a certain period, such as during testing. To disable a data export rule, use the following [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export update](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-update) command in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli):

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export update \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --name <rule-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name> \
              --enable false
          ```

      - question: |
          How can I delete an export rule?
        answer: |
          Use the following [az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export delete](/cli/azure/monitor/log-analytics/workspace/data-export#az-monitor-log-analytics-workspace-data-export-delete) command in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/what-is-azure-cli):

          ```azurecli
          az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export delete \
              --resource-group <resource-group-name> \
              --name <rule-name> \
              --workspace-name <workspace-name>
          ```

      - question: |
          What occurs if the export destination isn't available?
        answer: |
          If the export destination is unavailable, the data export process continues to try sending data for up to 30 minutes. If the destination is still unavailable after 30 minutes, the data is lost in the export process. You have to check the destination to determine whether it's available. After the destination becomes available, incoming data gets exported, but the data that was previously lost doesn't get re-exported.

      - question: |
          When should I use other export options?
        answer: |
          There are scenarios for which more export options are available. For more information, see [Other export options](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/logs-data-export#other-export-options).
