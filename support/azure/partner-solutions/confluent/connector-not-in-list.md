## Prerequisites

- Access to the Azure portal and Confluent Cloud.

## Symptoms

## Causes

- The connector list hasn't been refreshed after creation.
- There may be a delay or issue syncing the connector with the list.

## Solutions

- If you recently created a connector and it isn't in the list, select **Refresh** in the Azure portal.

### 2. Escalate to Confluent support

- If your Confluent connector still doesn't appear in the list, contact [Confluent support](https://support.confluent.io).

## Verify
