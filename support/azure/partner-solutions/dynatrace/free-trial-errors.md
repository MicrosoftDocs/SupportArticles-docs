# Free trial limitations

This article helps you understand limitations that you might encounter when creating or managing Dynatrace free trial resources on Azure, including resource creation limits and resource deletion after trial expiration.
 
## Symptoms

- You get an error when attempting to create another Dynatrace free trial resource.
- The Dynatrace free trial resource is missing or deleted after the trial period ends.

## Cause

- You can only create one Dynatrace resource during the trial period.
- With the free trial plan, your Dynatrace resource on Azure will be deleted automatically after the trial expires, unless you request an extension.

## Solution 1: Unable to create another free trial resource

Only one environment/resource can be created during the trial period. If you need additional environments, upgrade to a paid Dynatrace plan or wait until the trial expires and start a new trial (if eligible).

## Solution 2: Prepare for automatic free trial resource deletion

Be aware that free trial resources are deleted automatically after the trial period ends. If you require more time, [contact Dynatrace sales](mailto:sales@dynatrace.com) to request a trial extension or discuss upgrade options.
