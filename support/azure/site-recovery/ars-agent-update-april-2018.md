# Mandatory update for Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent: April 2018

This article describes an important update, new features, improvements, and fixes for Azure Backup for Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) Agent version 2.0.9118.0. This update is used by Microsoft Azure Backup and Microsoft Azure Site Recovery (ASR) for transferring data to Azure.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Site Recovery  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4095462

## Important update

If you currently use an earlier version than 2.0.9083.0 of the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent, also known as the Azure Backup agent, you must immediately download this update, install it, and then re-register the server that has Azure Backup. This is required to avoid backup and recovery failures that are caused by the deprecation of Access Control Services (ACS).

For more information about how to identify servers that have earlier versions of MARS agent in your environment, and the steps to update those servers, see the [Updating Azure Backup agents](/archive/blogs/srinathv/updating-azure-backup-agents).

## New features

### Offline Backup support for CSP subscriptions and ARM Storage Accounts

The MARS Agent Offline Backup workflow now supports Azure Resource Manager Storage Accounts and subscriptions. These are used for initial offline seeding of large file-folder backup data to Azure through the new Azure portal-based Azure Import Service, and they provide the following benefits:

- Cloud Solution Provider friendly
    In this update, the MARS Agent (stand-alone) can now be used by Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) to seed backup data to Azure by using disks without the need to create any classic resources such as non-CSP Subscriptions, Classic Storage Accounts or Classic Azure Import Jobs.
- Central monitoring and management of Azure Import Jobs
    Customers of MARS Agent-based offline backup can now move to the new Azure portal to monitor and track automatically created Azure Resource Manager Import Jobs from a single Import/Export Jobs page in the Azure portal, and update shipping details directly from the portal.
- More secure access to Azure Resources
    Azure Backup’s new workflow for Offline Backup eliminates the need for the Classic Azure Publish Settings file, uses secure Azure logon during the workflow, and uses an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application to provide secure and scoped access to the Azure Import Service.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The new workflow described here applies only to the Offline Backup of files and folders directly to Azure through the MARS Agent. Offline Backup workflow that's performed by using System Center Data Protection Manager to Azure or by using Microsoft Azure Backup Server remains unchanged.

## Issues that are fixed in this update

- System state backup and recovery success improvements
- Backup and recovery success improvements for the backup of files and folders
- Accessibility and reliability fixes and improvements

1. Navigate to the Recovery Services Vault where your servers are registered.

1. On the **Settings** blade, click **Backup Infrastructure** in the **Manage** section.

1. Click **Protected Servers** under **Management Servers**, and then select **Azure Backup Agent** as the **Backup Management Type**.

1. On the blade that appears, select a server for which the Agent version number is earlier than **2.0.9118.0**. On the server’s detail blade, click **Connect**. A Remote Desktop Connection file is downloaded that you can use to connect to the server, copy the update installer, and then run the installer to update the MARS Agent on the server.
