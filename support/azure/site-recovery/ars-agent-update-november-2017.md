## Key update

### System State Backup is generally available

System State backup with MARS Agent is now [generally available](https://aka.ms/azure-backup-system-state-ga) in all Azure regions. With this release, the MARS Agent has full production support for protecting data and operating system configuration on Windows file servers, Active Directory, and IIS web servers that are hosted on any Windows Server version from Windows Server 2008 R2 to Windows Server 2016.

By using System State Backup, you can protect your Active Directory servers, file servers, and IIS web servers for comprehensive disaster recovery. If you already back up files and folders, you can easily add System State to your policy without much effect on the size of backups that you send to Azure.

## New features

### Flexible backup schedule and retention policy for System State

Now you can configure daily backups for System State at a preferred time directly from the Mars Agent. You can also set retention ranges for your daily, weekly, and monthly system state backups.

### PowerShell support for System State backups

[PowerShell support](https://aka.ms/azure-backup-windows-server-powershell) is available for configuration, backup, and recovery of System State so that you can automate protection of Windows Server configuration at scale.

## Improvement and issues fixed in this update

- Fixes an issue that leads to backup failure in Windows 10 clients that have the RS3 Fall Creators Update installed. In this case, you receive the following error message: "The backup could not be started because of an unexpected error in the virtual disk service. Restart the virtual disk service and try the backup operation again. If the issue persists, check the system event log for virtual disk service events. (0x086C6)".
- Fixes an issue that leads to failure in the backup of compressed or encrypted files. In this case, you receive the following error message:
"Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent has detected inconsistencies while verifying the latest backup. A new recovery point could not be created. The next backup will attempt to transfer the data again. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft support (0x086D5)".
- Fixes an issue that prevents users of Offline backup in System Center Data Protection Manager and Azure Backup Server from modifying offline backup parameters after an offline backup job is configured.
- Includes several accessibility fixes and improvements.
