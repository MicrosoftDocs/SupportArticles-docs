# Mandatory update for Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent: September 2019

This article describes important updates, new features, improvements, and fixes for Azure Backup for the Microsoft Azure Recovery Services (MARS) agent version 2.0.9169.0 that is used by both Microsoft Azure Backup and Microsoft Azure Site Recovery (ASR) to transfer data to Azure. We strongly recommend that you download this version to take immediate advantage of critical backup and recovery features and improvements.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Site Recovery  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4515971

## New features

### Expiry time for ad-hoc backups

In this release, customers can specify the expiry time of ad-hoc backups (for both files and system state) instead of defaulting to retention policy settings. This provides greater control on the retention of specific recovery points that may be required for audit and compliance.

### Robocopy to accelerate item-level restores

Customers can now use the Windows native Robocopy tool for higher copy speeds when they recover individual files and folders from the recovery volume through the [Instant Restore](/azure/backup/backup-azure-restore-windows-server#use-instant-restore-to-recover-data-to-the-same-machine) method.

## Improvements

### More robust incremental backups with better tracking of skipped and failed files

MARS agent is now equipped for more resilient incremental backups, even when it encounters files that either are not backed up despite multiple attempts or get skipped because of [unsupported file types](/azure/backup/backup-support-matrix-mars-agent#supported-file-types-for-backup). Additionally, customers can now track skipped files during a backup.

### Enhanced error-reporting to resolve issues effectively

Customers can now directly select hyperlinks that are available in error messages (as opposed to copying them to a browser) to quickly navigate to contextual troubleshooting articles.

## Issues that are fixed in this update

- Fixes an issue that causes backups to be marked incorrectly as initial backup in certain scenarios.
- Adds backup and recovery success improvements for the backup of files and folders.
- Adds accessibility and reliability fixes and improvements.
