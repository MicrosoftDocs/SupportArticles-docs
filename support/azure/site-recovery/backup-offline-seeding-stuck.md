# Microsoft Azure Backup offline seeding is stuck at waiting for Azure import job to complete

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Azure Backup  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3119587

## Symptoms

When you try to use the Microsoft Azure Backup (MAB) offline seeding feature, the import job doesn't continue after it sends the drive to Azure for importing. Additionally, the MAB interface displays the following message and doesn't continue:

> Waiting for Azure Import Job to complete. Please check on Azure management portal for more information on job status

Additionally, you may see entries that resemble the following in _C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent\Temp\CBEngineCurr.errlog_:

```

```

## Cause

This issue can occur if the name that you entered for Azure Import Job Name when you configured offline seeding does not match the name that you entered for Job Name  in the Azure portal when you created the import job. Both job names must be identical before offline seeding can continue.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, remove the backup policy by using the **Stop protection and delete data**  option, and then schedule a new policy that has the correct offline backup parameters by providing a new import job name that matches the job name in the Azure portal.

For detailed information about how to do this, see the following article:
