When you click **WSB Failure Logs**, a file opens that contains an error message that resembles the following:

> Error in backup of Systemroot_pathduring enumerate: Error [0x8007007b] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

## Cause

This error occurs when the file specification that is required for enumerating files that must be backed up as part of the Windows Server System State is updated incorrectly.

## Resolution

> [!WARNING]
> Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly by using Registry Editor or by using another method. These problems might require that you reinstall the operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that these problems can be solved. Modify the registry at your own risk.

To make sure that the file specification is updated, follow these steps:

1. In the file that opens when you click **WSB Failure Logs**, verify that the **Systemroot_path** is correct. For example, **Systemroot_path** in the following error message should resemble `C:\Windows\\systemroot\`:

    > Error in backup of c:\windows\\systemroot\  during enumerate: Error [0x8007007b] The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

2. Run the following command at an elevated command prompt:

    ```console
    diskshadow /l Output_File_Path
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Output_File_Path**  placeholder should resemble `C:\outputfilepath.txt`.

3. Type the following commands at a DISKSHADOW prompt, and then press Enter after each command:

    ```console
    list writers detailed

    exit  
    ```

4. Open the output file that you specified in step 2.
5. Locate the line that contains **Systemroot_path** (`C:\Windows\\systemroot\` in our example above). For example, the line should resemble the following: File List: Path = **Systemroot_path**\system32\drivers, Filespec = **File_Spec_Path**

    For Example:  

    File List: Path = `C:\windows\\systemroot\system32\drivers`, Filespec = winmad.sys

6. Start Registry Editor. To do this, right-click **Start**, click **Run**, type **regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
7. Locate the following subkey: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`
8. Right-click **Services**, and then click **Find**.

9. In the **Find what** box, type the **File_Spec_Path** path that you found in step 5, and then click **Find Next**.

    The search results will feature a registry key that is named **ImagePath**. If its value has a leading backslash '\', then double-click that value and remove it. If the value does not start with a backslash, submit a support request from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?).
