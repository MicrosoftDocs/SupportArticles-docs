# Resolve Azure Synapse Studio connectivity issues

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Azure Synapse Analytics

Connectivity issues in Azure Synapse Studio are typically caused by configuration issues such as incorrect network settings or improper security role assignments. Use the following guidance to troubleshoot connectivity issues with Synapse Studio.

## Common issues and solutions

## Troubleshooting tips

- Learn how to [troubleshoot Azure Synapse Studio](/azure/synapse-analytics/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-synapse-studio#troubleshooting-steps).

- [Diagnose connectivity issues using this PowerShell script](/azure/synapse-analytics/troubleshoot/troubleshoot-synapse-studio-powershell).

- Confirm Synapse Studio can access all the required endpoints:

  - Ensure the firewall on your network and local computer allows outgoing communication on TCP ports 80, 443, and 1443 for Synapse Studio.
  - Allow outgoing communication on UDP port 53 for the DNS server for name resolution.
  - To connect using tools such as SSMS and Power BI, you must allow outgoing communication on TCP port 1433.
  - If you're using the default Redirect connection policy setting, you might need to allow outgoing communication on more ports.

- Test access with different browsers, and disable any pop-up blockers and plugins.

- Investigate issues related to security and permissions:

  - [Workspaces, data, and pipelines](/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/access-control)
  - [Managed identities](/azure/synapse-analytics/synapse-service-identity)
  - [Database access](/azure/azure-sql/database/logins-create-manage?toc=%2Fazure%2Fsynapse-analytics%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fsynapse-analytics%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json)

## Failed to load one or more resources due to a forbidden issue with error code 403

Error code 403 might be an intermittent issue while opening your Synapse workspace in Synapse Studio.

Make sure you have the following required permissions to access your workspace:

- From the Azure portal, navigate to your Synapse workspace > **Access control (IAM)** > **View my access**, and ensure that you have the Owner or Contributor permission.
- From the Azure portal, navigate to your Synapse workspace > **Networking**, and ensure that the correct client IP address is present in the firewall rules.

To solve the issue, use one of the following options:

**Option 1:** Try to manually sign in to your [workspace](https://web.azuresynapse.net). For more information, see [Create a Synapse workspace: Open Synapse Studio](/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace#open-synapse-studio).

**Option 2:** Try to use one of the following methods:

- Clear the **Cookies and Cached data** of your browser.
- Use Private mode.
- Try using a different browser.

## Setting up Synapse on a private network

You might not be able to connect to Azure Synapse if you disable the public network in the firewall.

Enable Public IP and add specific IPs that need to access Azure Synapse. Azure Firewall won't allow any other Public IP Address besides the one already added.

If you want to disable public IP, you can implement one of the following options:

- If only a few users are planning to connect to Azure Synapse from their own machine, use a [Point-To-Site](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal) VPN connection to connect to Azure Synapse.
- If many users want to connect to Azure services from their own workstation, use [ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-introduction).
