### The logon attempt failed

If you come across an error saying "The logon attempt failed" on the Windows Security credential prompt, verify the following:

- You're using a device that is Microsoft Entra joined or Microsoft Entra hybrid joined to the same Microsoft Entra tenant as the session host.
- The [PKU2U protocol is enabled](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-allow-pku2u-authentication-requests-to-this-computer-to-use-online-identities) on both the local PC and the session host.
- [Per-user multifactor authentication is disabled](/azure/virtual-desktop/set-up-mfa#azure-ad-joined-session-host-vms) for the user account as it's not supported for Microsoft Entra joined VMs.

### The sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed

If you come across an error:

> The sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed. Try a different sign-in method or contact your system administrator.

You have Conditional Access policies restricting access. Follow the instructions in [Enforce Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for Azure Virtual Desktop using Conditional Access](/azure/virtual-desktop/set-up-mfa#azure-ad-joined-session-host-vms) to enforce Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for your Microsoft Entra joined VMs.

### A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated

If you come across an error:

> An authentication error occurred. A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.

Verify that you properly created and configured the Kerberos server object when [configuring single sign-on](/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-single-sign-on).
