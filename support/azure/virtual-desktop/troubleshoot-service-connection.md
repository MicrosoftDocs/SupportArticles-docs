# Troubleshoot Azure Virtual Desktop service connections

This article helps resolve issues with Azure Virtual Desktop service connections.

## Provide feedback

You can give us feedback and discuss the Azure Virtual Desktop service with the product team and other active community members at the [Azure Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop/bd-p/AzureVirtualDesktopForum).

## User connects but nothing is displayed (no feed)

A user can start Remote Desktop clients and is able to authenticate. However, the user doesn't see any icons in the web discovery feed.

1. Confirm that the user reporting the issues has been assigned to application groups by using the following cmdlet:

     ```powershell
     Get-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName <userupn>
     ```

2. Confirm that the user is signing in with the correct credentials.
3. If the web client is being used, confirm that there are no cached credentials issues.
4. If the user is part of a Microsoft Entra user group, make sure the user group is a security group instead of a distribution group. Azure Virtual Desktop doesn't support Microsoft Entra distribution groups.

## User loses existing feed and no remote resource is displayed (no feed)

This error usually appears after a user moved their subscription from one Microsoft Entra tenant to another. As a result, the service loses track of their user assignments, since those are still tied to the old Microsoft Entra tenant.

To resolve this, all you need to do is reassign the users to their application groups.

This could also happen if a CSP Provider created the subscription and then transferred to the customer. To resolve this, re-register the Resource Provider.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. Go to **Subscription**, and then select your subscription.
3. In the menu on the left side of the page, select **Resource provider**.
4. Find and select **Microsoft.DesktopVirtualization**, and then select **Re-register**.

## User sees Conditional Access error preventing access to Microsoft Entra ID resource

This error occurs when the user is subject to a Conditional Access policy that's blocking access to a specific Microsoft Entra ID resource, either when signing into the Windows App or when making a connection to a resource. This usually happens for one of two reasons:

- The user is trying to sign in with the Windows App either on Windows or in a web browser but doesn't have access to both the Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365 apps through Conditional Access policies.
  > [!NOTE]
  > The Windows App will try to authenticate the user to both these apps even if the user isn't assigned a Windows 365 Cloud PC.

- The user is signing into a resource with Microsoft Entra-based single sign-on configured but doesn't have access to the Windows Cloud Login app through Conditional Access policies.

To resolve this, first validate the user's [sign-in identity](/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-sign-ins) and then see [Enforce Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for Azure Virtual Desktop using Conditional Access](/azure/virtual-desktop/set-up-mfa).
