# Troubleshooting overview, feedback, and support for Azure Virtual Desktop

This article provides an overview of the issues you might encounter when setting up an Azure Virtual Desktop environment and provides ways to resolve the issues.

## Troubleshoot deployment and connection issues

[Azure Virtual Desktop Insights](/azure/virtual-desktop/insights) is a dashboard built on Azure Monitor workbooks that can quickly troubleshoot and identify issues in your Azure Virtual Desktop environment for you. If you prefer to work with Kusto queries, we recommend using the built-in diagnostic feature, [Log Analytics](/azure/virtual-desktop/diagnostics-log-analytics), instead.

## Report issues

To report issues or suggest features for Azure Virtual Desktop with Azure Resource Manager integration, visit the [Azure Virtual Desktop Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-virtual-desktop/bd-p/AzureVirtualDesktopForum). You can use the Tech Community to discuss best practices or suggest and vote for new features.

When you make a post asking for help or propose a new feature, make sure you describe your scenario in as much detail as possible. Detailed information can help other users answer your question or understand the feature you're proposing to vote for.

## Help with application issues

If you encounter issues with your applications running in Azure Virtual Desktop, App Assure is a service from Microsoft designed to help you resolve them at no extra cost. For more information, go to [App Assure](/microsoft-365/fasttrack/windows-and-other-services#app-assure).

## Escalation tracks

Before doing anything else, check the [Azure status page](https://azure.status.microsoft/status) and [Azure Service Health](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/service-health/) to make sure your Azure service is running properly.

Use the following table to identify and resolve issues you might encounter when setting up an environment using Remote Desktop client. Once your environment's set up, you can use our new diagnostics service to identify issues for common scenarios.

| **Issue**                                                            | **Suggested Solution**  |
