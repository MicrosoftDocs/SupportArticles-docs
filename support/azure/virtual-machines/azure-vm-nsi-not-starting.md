# Azure Virtual Machine - Network Store Interface (NSI) service is not starting

## Symptoms

1. The virtual machine (VM) screenshot shows the operating system (OS) fully loaded and waiting for credentials.

2. If you view the Guest OS Logs, you'll see that the core networking service, **Network Store Interface (NSI)**, is not starting or failing to start. This issue could be due to a hang, a crash of this service, or any required service to be run before it.

### Connect to the VM using Serial console (Troubleshoot cause)

If you're unable to successfully RDP to the virtual machine (VM), use PowerShell and [Serial Console](/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/serial-console-windows) to check for the log entries.

1. On the command line, launch PowerShell by running `powershell.exe`.
2. In PowerShell, execute the following commands:

```ps
psCopy
```

```ps
remove-module psreadline
```

```ps
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; StartTime=(Get-Date).AddDays(-1); ProviderName='Service Control Manager'}
```

## Cause

The NSI service is not running on the Virtual Machine. This issue happens in the following scenarios:

1. The NSI service was set to **disabled**.
2. The NSI is not responding, or is crashing.
3. Another required service is not running.

## Solution

Backup the VM OS disk using your preferred method.

One method that you can use is to [take a snapshot of the disk](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk).

### Connect to the VM using Serial console (Solution)

Connect to the VM using [Serial Console](/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/serial-console-windows) to attempt to get the NSI service started.

1. In the Serial Console, execute this command:

   `sc query NSI`

2. If the service is shown as:

   1. **Stopped** â€“ Try to start the service:

      `sc start NSI`

      1. If the service starts without error and you can connect to the VM, then stop here.

   2. **Starting/Stopping** - Try stopping and starting the service again with these commands:

      `sc stop NSI`

      `sc start NSI`

3. If the NSI service is disabled:

   1. First set the service to automatic:

      `sc config NSI start=auto`

   1. Start the NSI service:

      `sc start NSI`

   1. Check if the NSI service is running:

      `sc query NSI`

4. IF the NSI service fails due to a dependency, you can try the above process on the dependency that was listed.
Once the NSI service is running you can try accessing the VM via RDP.
