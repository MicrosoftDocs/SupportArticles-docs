# Can't connect to Azure Linux VM through network

This article fixes an issue in which network errors prevent you from connecting to Azure Linux virtual machines.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Virtual Machine running Linux  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4010059

## Symptoms

The primary interface on an Azure Linux virtual machine (VM) is eth0. If eth0 isn't configured, the VM is not accessible over a network connection even when other tools indicate the VM is up.

When the issue occurs, the Secure Shell (SSH) connection that has correct permissions may start to connect to the VM. However, it ultimately cannot access the VM because of the network issue.

The networking errors are typically logged in the serial console log. Specifically, you may see the following errors.  

## Errors in the serial console log  

### CentOS Linux distribution errors  

#### Error 1

```
Bringing up interface eth0:
Device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialization.
[FAILED]

```

#### Error 2

```

Bringing up interface eth0: Device eth0 has different MAC address than expected, ignoring.
[FAILED]

```

#### Error 3

```

## Resolution  

### For CentOS

Remove the **HWADDR** directive from the **ifcfg-eth0** file under `/etc/sysconfig/network-script`.  

### For SUSE Linux

Remove the files that contain entries for eth0 or eth1 under `/etc/udev/rules.d`.  

### For Ubuntu  

#### Error 1

This error indicates that the aneth1 interface is configured instead of eth0. This may occur if the operating system on the VM does not have some updates for _udev_ installed. In this situation, *udev* incorrectly saves the previous network interface. When the VM is resized or moved, it receives a different MAC address, which will be assigned to eth1.

> [!NOTE]
> You can verify the version of the image from the serial logs. If a very old Ubuntu kernel (for example 3.2.0-58.88, released in January 2014) is found, this indicates that the operating system has not been updated.

To resolve this issue, attach the OS disk to another running VM, and then delete the udev rule file under `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules`.

To avoid this issue in the future, we recommend that you update the udev package on the VM. For example, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install udev
```

#### Error 2

To resolve this issue, reset the `/etc/network/interfaces.d/eth0.cfg` file to the default, and make it request the Azure DHCP to obtain an IP address. Then, remove the files in the `/var/lib/dhcp` folder that contain cached DHCP settings. The following is an example of the default eth0.cfg file:

```bash
# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```

## Resolve the issue on a customized Linux operating system

If the VM that has the networking issue uses your uploaded VHD, you can try to configure the network based on a working gallery image. To do this, attach the problematic disk as a data disk to the gallery VM, and then run the following commands.  

```bash
fdisk -l
df -h
mount /dev/sdc1 /temporary
df -h
cd /temporary/etc/udev/rules.d
ls -ltr
mv 70-persistent-net.rules /temporary/root/
cd ../../network

ls
mv interfaces interfaces.org
ls -ltr
```

Copy to the current folder files from the working VM:

```bash
cp /etc/network/interfaces . 
cp -R /etc/network/interfaces
cp -R /etc/network/interfaces.d .
cp -R /etc/network/interfaces.dynamic.d .
ls -ltr
cd ..
cd
umount /mnt
```

For more information about how to attach a data disk to the gallery VM, see [How to attach a data disk to a Windows VM in the Azure portal](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/attach-managed-disk-portal).
