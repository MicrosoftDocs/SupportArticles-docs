# Chroot environment in a Linux Rescue VM

This article describes how to troubleshoot the chroot environment in the Rescue virtual machine (VM) in Linux.

## Ubuntu 16.x && Ubuntu 18.x

1. Stop or de-allocate the affected VM.
1. Create a rescue VM image of the same OS version, in same resource group (RSG) and location using managed disk.
1. Use the Azure portal to take a snapshot of the affected virtual machine's OS disk.
1. Create a disk out of the snapshot of the OS disk, and attach it to the Rescue VM.
1. Once the disk has been created, Troubleshoot the chroot environment in the Rescue VM.

   1. Access your VM as the root user using the following command:

      `sudo su -`

   1. Find the disk using `dmesg` (the method you use to discover your new disk may vary). The following example uses **dmesg** to filter on **SCSI** disks:

      `dmesg | grep SCSI`

      Your output will be similar to the following example. In this example, we want the **sdc** disk:

      ```
      [    0.294784] SCSI subsystem initialized
      [    0.573458] Block layer SCSI generic (bsg) driver version 0.4 loaded (major 252)
      [    7.110271] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] Attached SCSI disk
      [    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
      [ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk
      ```

   1. Use the following commands to access the chroot environment:

      ```
      mkdir /rescue
      mount /dev/sdc1 /rescue
      mount /dev/sdc15 /rescue/boot/efi
      cd /rescue

      mount -t proc proc proc
      mount -t sysfs sys sys/
      mount -o bind /dev dev/
      mount -o bind /dev/pts dev/pts/
      mount -o bind /run run/
      chroot /rescue
      ```

   1. Troubleshoot the chroot environment.

   1. Use the following commands to exit the chroot environment:

      ```
      exit

      umount /rescue/proc/
      umount /rescue/sys/
      umount /rescue/dev/pts
      umount /rescue/dev/
      umount /rescue/run
      cd /
      umount /rescue/boot/efi
      umount /rescue
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you receive the error `unable to unmount /rescue`, add -l option to the umount command.
      >
      > Example: `umount -l /rescue`

1. Detach the disk from the rescue VM and perform a disk swap with the original VM.
1. Start the original VM and check its connectivity.

## RHEL/Centos/Oracle 6.x && Oracle 8.x && RHEL/Centos 7.x with RAW Partitions

1. Stop or de-allocate the affected VM.
1. Create a Rescue VM image of the same OS version, in same resource group (RSG) and location using managed disk.
1. Use the Azure portal to take a snapshot of the affected virtual machine's OS disk.
1. Create a disk out of the snapshot of the OS disk, and attach it to the Rescue VM.
1. Once the disk has been created, Troubleshoot the chroot environment in the Rescue VM.

   1. Access your VM as the root user using the following command:

      `sudo su -`

   1. Find the disk using `dmesg` (the method you use to discover your new disk may vary). The following example uses **dmesg** to filter on **SCSI** disks:

      [    8.079653] sd 3:0:1:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI disk
      [ 1828.162306] sd 5:0:0:0: [sdc] Attached SCSI disk
      ```

   1. Use the following commands to access the chroot environment:

      ```
      mkdir /rescue
      mount -o nouuid /dev/sdc2 /rescue
      mount -o nouuid /dev/sdc1 /rescue/boot/
      cd /rescue

      mount -t proc proc proc
      mount -t sysfs sys sys/
      mount -o bind /dev dev/
      mount -o bind /dev/pts dev/pts/
      mount -o bind /run run/
      chroot /rescue
      ```

   1. Troubleshoot the chroot environment.

   1. Use the following commands to exit the chroot environment:

      ```
      exit

      umount /rescue/proc/

      umount /rescue/dev/pts
      umount /rescue/dev/
      umount /rescue/run
      cd /
      umount /rescue/boot/
      umount /rescue
      ```

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you receive the error `unable to unmount /rescue`, add -l option to the umount command.
      >
      > Example: `umount -l /rescue`

1. Detach the disk from the rescue VM and perform a disk swap with the original VM.
1. Start the original VM and check its connectivity.

## RHEL/Centos 7.x with LVM

   > [!NOTE]

      ```
      vgscan --mknodes
