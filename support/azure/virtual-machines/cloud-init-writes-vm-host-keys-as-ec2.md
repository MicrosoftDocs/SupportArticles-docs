# Cloud-init writes virtual machine's host keys as ec2

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Virtual Machine running Linux  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4561944

## Symptoms

Cloud-init intermittently writes SSH Host keys to console as 'ec2'. Azure doesn't use ec2Â instances.

## Cause

Cloud-init uses the SSH module to call the write-ssh-key-fingerprints helper script in the final stage. The helper logged these values setting the program name to 'ec2'. The name of the cloud-init project was 'ec2-init' before changing to a platform-agnostic name. Some code paths still include the old name.

## Workaround

Ignore 'ec2' logs during troubleshooting. You'll find more information in the [Bug description](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/%2Bbug/1869277) article.
