# Understand common error messages when you manage virtual machines in Azure

This article describes some of the most common error codes and messages you may encounter when you create or manage virtual machines (VMs) in Azure.

>[!NOTE]
> You can leave comments on this page for feedback or through [Azure feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/216843-virtual-machines) with #azerrormessage tag.

## Error Response Format

Azure VMs use the following JSON format for error response:

```json
{
  "status": "status code",
  "error": {
    "code":"Top level error code",
    "message":"Top level error message",
    "details":[
     {
      "code":"Inner level error code",
      "message":"Inner level error message"
     }
    ]
   }
}
```

An error response always includes a status code and an error object. Each error object always contains an error code and a message. If the VM is created with a template, the error object also contains a details section that contains an inner level of error codes and message. Normally, the most inner level of error message is the root failure.

## Common virtual machine management errors

This section lists the common error messages you may encounter when managing VMs:
