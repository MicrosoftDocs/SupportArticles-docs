# How to use PerfInsights

[PerfInsights Linux](https://aka.ms/perfinsightslinuxdownload) is a self-help diagnostics tool that collects and analyzes the diagnostic data, and provides a report to help troubleshoot Linux virtual machine performance problems in Azure. PerfInsights can be run on supported virtual machines as a standalone tool, or directly from the portal by using [Performance Diagnostics for Azure virtual machines](performance-diagnostics.md).

If you are experiencing performance problems with virtual machines, before contacting support, run this tool.

## Supported troubleshooting scenarios

PerfInsights can collect and analyze several kinds of information. The following sections cover common scenarios.

### Quick performance analysis

This scenario collects basic information such as storage and hardware configuration of your virtual machine, various logs, including:

- Operating System information

- PCI device information

- General Guest OS logs

- Configuration files

- Storage information

- Azure Virtual Machine Configuration (collected using [Azure Instance Metadata Service](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service)

- List of running processes, Disk, Memory, and CPU usage

- Networking information

This is a passive collection of information that shouldn't affect the system.

>[!Note]
>Quick performance analysis scenario is automatically included in each of the following scenarios:

### Known issues

- RHEL 8 does not have Python installed by default. To run PerfInsights Linux, you must first install Python 2.7

- Guest Agent information collection may fail on CentOS 6.x

- PCI devices information is not collected on Debian based distributions

- LVM information is partially collected on some distributions

### How do I run PerfInsights

You can run PerfInsights on a virtual machine by installing Azure Performance Diagnostics from Azure portal. You can also run it as a standalone tool.

>[!Note]
>PerfInsights simply collects and analyzes the data. It does not make any modifications to the system.

#### Install and run PerfInsights from the Azure portal

For more information about this option, see [Azure Performance Diagnostics](performance-diagnostics.md).  

#### Run PerfInsights in standalone mode

To run the PerfInsights tool, follow these steps:

1. Download [PerfInsights.tar.gz](https://aka.ms/perfinsightslinuxdownload) to a folder on your virtual machine and extract the contents using the below commands from the terminal.

   ```bash
   wget https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/F/8/9F80419C-D60D-45F1-8A98-718855F25722/PerfInsights.tar.gz
   ```

   ```bash
   tar xzvf PerfInsights.tar.gz
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder that contains `perfinsights.py` file, and then run `perfinsights.py` to view the available commandline parameters.

    ```bash
    cd <the path of PerfInsights folder>
    sudo python perfinsights.py
    ```

    ![Screenshot of PerfInsights Linux commandline output](media/how-to-use-perfinsights-linux/perfinsights-linux-commandline.png)

    The basic syntax for running PerfInsights scenarios is:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r <ScenarioName> -d [duration]<H | M | S> [AdditionalOptions]
    ```

    You can use the below example to run Quick performance analysis scenario for 1 minute and create the results under /tmp/output folder:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r quick -d 1M -a -o /tmp/output
    ```

    You can use the below example to run performance analysis scenario for 5 mins and upload the result tar ball to the storage account:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r vmslow -d 300S -a -t <StorageAccountName> -k <StorageAccountKey> -i <full resource Uri of the current VM>
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >Before running a scenario, PerfInsights prompts the user to agree to share diagnostic information and to agree to the EULA. Use **-a or --accept-disclaimer-and-share-diagnostics** option to skip these prompts.
    >
    >If you have an active support ticket with Microsoft and running PerfInsights per the request of the support engineer you are working with, make sure to provide the support ticket number using the **-s or --support-request** option.

When the run is completed, a new tar file appears in the same folder as PerfInsights unless no output folder is specified. The name of the file is **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz.** You can send this file to the support agent for analysis or open the report inside the file to review findings and recommendations.

## Review the diagnostics report

Within the **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz** file, you can find an HTML report that details the findings of PerfInsights. To review the report, expand the **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz** file, and then open the **PerfInsights Report.html** file.

### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides basic run details and virtual machine information. The **Findings** tab displays a summary of the recommendations from all the different sections of the PerfInsights report.

## Next steps

You can upload diagnostics logs and reports to Microsoft Support for further review. When you work with the Microsoft Support staff, they might request that you transmit the output that is generated by PerfInsights to assist with the troubleshooting process.

The following screenshot shows a message similar to what you might receive:

![Screenshot of sample message from Microsoft Support](media/how-to-use-perfinsights-linux/support-email.png)

Follow the instructions in the message to access the file transfer workspace. For additional security, you have to change your password on first use.

After you sign in, you will find a dialog box to upload the **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz** file that was collected by PerfInsights.
