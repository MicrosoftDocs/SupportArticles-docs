# How to use PerfInsights

[PerfInsights Linux](https://aka.ms/perfinsightslinuxdownload) is a self-help diagnostics tool that collects and analyzes the diagnostic data, and provides a report to help troubleshoot Linux virtual machine performance problems in Azure. PerfInsights can be run on supported virtual machines as a standalone tool, or directly from the portal by using [Performance Diagnostics for Azure virtual machines](performance-diagnostics.md).

If you are experiencing performance problems with virtual machines, before contacting support, run this tool.

## Supported troubleshooting scenarios

PerfInsights can collect and analyze several kinds of information. The following sections cover common scenarios.

### Quick performance analysis

This scenario collects basic information such as storage and hardware configuration of your virtual machine, various logs, including:

- Operating System information

- PCI device information

- General Guest OS logs

- Configuration files

- Storage information

- Azure Virtual Machine Configuration (collected using [Azure Instance Metadata Service](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service)

- List of running processes, Disk, Memory, and CPU usage

- Networking information

This is a passive collection of information that shouldn't affect the system.

>[!Note]
>Quick performance analysis scenario is automatically included in each of the following scenarios:

### Performance analysis

This scenario is similar to Quick performance analysis but allows capturing diagnostics information for longer duration.

### HPC performance analysis

This scenario is meant for troubleshooting issues on HPC size VMs, meaning H-Series and N-Series. It checks a VMs configuration against what the Azure HPC Platform team has tested and recommends. It also collects logs and diagnostics related to the status and configuration of the special hardware that is available on those VMs, including:

- GPU Driver information

- GPU hardware diagnostics

- InfiniBand driver information and configuration

- InfiniBand device diagnostics

- Network configuration files

- Performance tuning information

>[!Note]
>Some tools used by the HPC performance analysis scenario, such as cli commands that are packaged in with device drivers, are not present on all VMs. In such cases, those portions of the analysis will be skipped. Running this scenario does not install any software on VMs or make any other permanent changes.

>[!Note]
>Running the HPC scenario directly from the Azure Portal is not supported at this time, so PerfInsights must be downloaded and run from the command line to use it.

### Performance diagnostics trace

Runs a rule-based engine in the background to collect data and diagnose ongoing performance issues. Rules are displayed in the report under the Category -> Finding tab.

Each rule consists of the following:

- Finding: Description of the finding.
- Recommendation: Recommendation on what action could be taken for the finding. There are also reference link(s) to documentation that provide more information on the finding and/or recommendation.
- Impact Level: Represents the potential for having an impact on performance.

The following categories of rules are currently supported:

- High resource usage:

  - High CPU usage: Detects high CPU usage periods, and shows the top CPU usage consumers during those periods.
  - High memory usage: Detects high memory usage periods, and shows the top memory usage consumers during those periods.
  - High disk usage: Detects high disk usage periods on physical disks, and shows the top disk usage consumers during those periods.

- Storage: Detects specific storage configurations.
- Memory: Detects specific memory configurations.
- GPU: Detects specific GPU configurations.
- Network: Detects specific network settings.
- System: Detects specific system settings.

>[!Note]
>[`*`] PCI information is not yet collected on Debian and SLES distributions.
>
>[`**`] /var/log/sysstat or /var/log/sa contains the System Activity Report (SAR) files that are collected by the sysstat package. If the sysstat package is not installed on the VM, the PerfInsights tool provides a recommendation to install it.

## Run the PerfInsights Linux on your VM

### What do I have to know before I run the tool

#### Tool requirements

- This tool must be run on the VM that has the performance issue.
- Python 3.6 or a later version, must be installed on the VM. 
  > [!Note]
  > Python 2 is no longer supported by the Python Software Foundation (PSF). If Python 2.7 is installed on the VM, PerfInsights can be installed. However, no changes or bug fixes will be made in PerfInsights to support Python 2.7. For more information, see [Sunsetting Python 2](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/).

- The following distributions are currently supported:

    | Distribution               | Version                                         |

>[!Note]
>[`*`] Please refer to [Known issues](#known-issues) section

>[!Note]
>[`*`] The HPC scenario relies on the [HPCDiag](https://aka.ms/hpcdiag) tool, so check its support matrix for supported VM sizes and OSes. In particular, NDv4 size VMs aren't yet supported and reports for those VMs may show extraneous findings.

### Known issues

- RHEL 8 does not have Python installed by default. To run PerfInsights Linux, you must first install Python 2.7 or Python 3.x

- Guest Agent information collection may fail on CentOS 6.x

- PCI devices information is not collected on Debian based distributions

- LVM information is partially collected on some distributions

### How do I run PerfInsights

You can run PerfInsights on a virtual machine by installing Azure Performance Diagnostics from Azure portal. You can also run it as a standalone tool.

>[!Note]
>PerfInsights simply collects and analyzes the data. It does not make any modifications to the system.

#### Install and run PerfInsights from the Azure portal

For more information about this option, see [Azure Performance Diagnostics](performance-diagnostics.md).  

#### Run PerfInsights in standalone mode

To run the PerfInsights tool, follow these steps:

1. Download [PerfInsights.tar.gz](https://aka.ms/perfinsightslinuxdownload) to a folder on your virtual machine and extract the contents using the below commands from the terminal.

   ```bash
   wget https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/F/8/9F80419C-D60D-45F1-8A98-718855F25722/PerfInsights.tar.gz
   ```

   ```bash
   tar xzvf PerfInsights.tar.gz
   ```

2. Navigate to the folder that contains `perfinsights.py` file, and then run `perfinsights.py` to view the available commandline parameters.

    ```bash
    cd <the path of PerfInsights folder>
    sudo python perfinsights.py
    ```

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-use-perfinsights-linux/perfinsights-linux-commandline.png" alt-text="Screenshot of PerfInsights Linux command-line output.":::

    The basic syntax for running PerfInsights scenarios is:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r <ScenarioName> -d [duration]<H | M | S> [AdditionalOptions]
    ```

    You can use the below example to run Quick performance analysis scenario for 1 minute and create the results under /tmp/output folder:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r quick -d 1M -a -o /tmp/output
    ```

    You can use the below example to run performance analysis scenario for 5 mins and upload the result (stores in a TAR file) to the storage account:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r vmslow -d 300S -a -t <StorageAccountName> -k <StorageAccountKey> -i <full resource Uri of the current VM>
    ```

    You can use the below example to run the HPC performance analysis scenario for 1 mins and upload the result TAR file to the storage account:

    ```bash
    sudo python perfinsights.py -r hpc -d 60S -a -t <StorageAccountName> -k <StorageAccountKey> -i <full resource Uri of the current VM>
    ```

    >[!Note]
    >Before running a scenario, PerfInsights prompts the user to agree to share diagnostic information and to agree to the EULA. Use **-a or --accept-disclaimer-and-share-diagnostics** option to skip these prompts.
    >
    >If you have an active support ticket with Microsoft and running PerfInsights per the request of the support engineer you are working with, make sure to provide the support ticket number using the **-s or --support-request** option.

When the run is completed, a new tar file appears in the same folder as PerfInsights unless no output folder is specified. The name of the file is **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz.** You can send this file to the support agent for analysis or open the report inside the file to review findings and recommendations.

## Review the diagnostics report

Within the **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz** file, you can find an HTML report that details the findings of PerfInsights. To review the report, expand the **PerformanceDiagnostics\_yyyy-MM-dd\_hh-mm-ss-fff.tar.gz** file, and then open the **PerfInsights Report.html** file.
