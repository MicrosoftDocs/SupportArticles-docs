# Troubleshoot UEFI boot failures in Azure Linux virtual machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

[!INCLUDE [CentOS End Of Life](../../../includes/centos-end-of-life-note.md)]

Linux partner images in Azure Marketplace are tagged and configured for both BIOS generation 1 boot and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) generation 2 boot.

When you deploy generation 2 Linux virtual machines (VMs) in Azure, you may encounter UEFI boot failures. This article discusses some scenarios where UEFI boot failures occur and provides solutions.

## Symptoms

When you deploy a generation 2 Linux VM in Azure, the boot fails, and the server is inaccessible.

## Identify UEFI boot errors

Check the current state of your VM by using the [Azure boot diagnostics](../windows/boot-diagnostics.md).

The boot diagnostics screenshot shows the following error messages:

- Error 1

    > Virtual Machine Boot Summary
    >
    > 1. Unknown Device  
    >     The boot loader did not load an operating system.
    > 2. SCSI Disk (0,0)  
    >    The boot loader did not load an operating system.
    > 3. SCSI Disk (0,1)  
    >    The boot loader did not load an operating system.
    > 4. Network Adapter (000D3A4DD64D)  
    >    A boot image was not found.  
    >
    > No operating system was loaded. Your virtual machine may be configured incorrectly. Exit and re-configure your VM or click restart to retry the current boot sequence again.

## Before you troubleshoot

To perform the offline VM repair that's required for [Scenario 1: UEFI partition in boot image is missing](#scenario1) and [Scenario 2: UEFI partition in boot image is corrupted](#scenario2), make sure that you have access to Azure CLI or [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com).

## <a id="scenario1"></a>Scenario 1: UEFI partition in boot image is missing

If the UEFI boot loader partition is missing or deleted, the generation 2 Linux VM will fail to boot.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use the [az vm repair create](/cli/azure/vm/repair#az-vm-repair-create) command to create a repair VM. The repair VM will have a copy of the OS disk for the non-functional VM attached. For more information, see [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

2. Recreate the partition by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    root@repair-centos7:~# gdisk /dev/sdc
    GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3
    
    Partition table scan:
      MBR: protective
      BSD: not present
      APM: not present
      GPT: present
    
    Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

    Command (? for help): w
    
    Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
    PARTITIONS!!
    
    Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): Y
    OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sdc.
    Warning: The kernel is still using the old partition table.
    The new table will be used at the next reboot or after you
    run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)
    The operation has completed successfully.
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > * Replace `/dev/sdc` with the corresponding copy of the operating system (OS) disk device.
    > * The partition number choice doesn't matter as long as the sector start and end points are correct. The correct sector start and end points are chosen because the OS is able to determine the missing sectors.
    > * Ensure the ending sector isn't occupied by any other partition within the disk. Choosing default values should suffice here.

    Azure Linux partner images have the following partition number, sector start points, and sector end points:

    Linux OS Distribution| EFI Partition number|Sector Start|Sector End|
    |----------------|--------------------|------------|----------|
    | CentOS 7 | 15 |10240 | 1024000 |
    | CentOS 8 | 15 |10240 | 1024000 |
    | Debian 10 | 15 | 8192 |262143 |
    | Debian 11 | 15 | 8192 |262143 |
    | RHEL 7 | 1 |2048 | 1026047 |
    | RHEL 8 | 15 |10240 | 1024000 |
    | Oracle Linux 7 | 15 |10240 | 1024000 |
    | Oracle Linux 8 | 15 |10240 | 1024000 |
    | Ubuntu 18.04 | 15 |10240 | 227327 |
    | Ubuntu 20.04 | 15 |10240 | 227327 |
    | SLES 12 | 2| 6144 | 1054719 |
    | SLES 15 | 2| 6144 | 1054719 |

3. Once the partition is recreated, restore the VM by swapping the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM by using the [az vm repair restore](/cli/azure/vm/repair#az-vm-repair-restore) command. For more information, see the step 5 in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

## <a id="scenario2"></a>Scenario 2: UEFI partition in boot image is corrupted

If the UEFI boot partition is corrupted, the generation 2 Linux VM will fail to boot. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Use the [az vm repair create](/cli/azure/vm/repair#az-vm-repair-create) command to create a repair VM. The repair VM will have a copy of the OS disk for the non-functional VM attached. For more information, see [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

2. Clean the corrupted partition by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    root@repair-centos7:~# gdisk -l /dev/sdc
    GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.3
    
    Partition table scan:
      MBR: protective
      BSD: not present
      APM: not present
      GPT: present
    
    Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
    Disk /dev/sdc: 134217728 sectors, 64.0 GiB
    Model: Virtual Disk    
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512/4096 bytes
    Disk identifier (GUID): <Disk GUID>
    Partition table holds up to 128 entries
    Main partition table begins at sector 2 and ends at sector 33
    First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 134217694
    Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries
    Total free space is 4029 sectors (2.0 MiB)
    
    Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name
       1         1026048         3123199   1024.0 MiB  0700

    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > * Replace `/dev/sdc` with the corresponding copy of the OS disk device.
    > * Always take a backup of the OS disk and perform a dry run with the `-n` option before performing the file system check mentioned above.
    > * The `dosfsck` command can be used to perform the vfat file system check. Both commands are the same. For more information, see [fsck.vfat](https://linux.die.net/man/8/fsck.vfat).

3. Once the partition is cleaned, restore the VM by swapping the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM by using the [az vm repair restore](/cli/azure/vm/repair#az-vm-repair-restore) command. For more information, see the step 5 in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

## Scenario 3: Entire /boot partition contents are deleted

If the entire /boot partition or other important contents are missing and can't be recovered, restoring the VM from a backup is the only option. For more information, see [How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).
