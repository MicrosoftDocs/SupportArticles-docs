# Unable to resize MBR partition for a data disk larger than 2 TB in Linux virtual machine

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article provides a solution to an issue where you fail to resize a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition for a data disk larger than 2 TB in an Azure Linux virtual machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies to supported [endorsed Linux distributions](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros).

## Symptoms

When you run the `fdisk` command to resize an MBR partition, you receive the following warning message:

> The size of this disk is 8.8 TB. DOS partition table format can't be used on drives for volumes larger than 2 TB for 512-byte sectors. Use parted(1) and GUID partition table format (GPT).

Here's a command sample:

```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdd
```
Here's a command output sample:

```output

```

To verify the new size, follow these steps:

1. Inform the operating system (OS) of the partition table change by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo partprobe /dev/sdd
    ```

2. Check the new size of the partition `/dev/sdd1` by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,RO,MOUNTPOINT
    ```
    The command output shows the partition was resized only to 2 TB. Here's a command output example:
    
    ```output
    NAME              TYPE FSTYPE      LABEL  SIZE RO MOUNTPOINT
    sda               disk                     32G  0
    ├─sda1            part vfat               500M  0 /boot/efi
    ├─sda2            part xfs                500M  0 /boot
    ├─sda3            part xfs                 31G  0 /
    └─sda4            part                      2M  0
    sdb               disk                    256G  0
    └─sdb1            part ext4               256G  0 /mnt
    sdd               disk                      8T  0
    └─sdd1            part ext4                 2T  0 /appext4
    ```

## Cause

The MBR, which contains the partition boundaries and partition (file system) type information, has an addressing limit of 2^32 sectors. The 32-bit address limitation within the MBR partition data structure limits the size of the disk and partition.

For 512-byte sectors, the address limitation for an MBR partition is 2 TB. For newer 4Kn devices, each logical sector is 2^32 x 4,096 bytes, or 16 TB.

## Solution

Because the GUID Partition Table (GPT) has no sector address limitations, we recommend using GPT for a data disk of 2 TB or larger. 

Here are two methods to use GPT on data disks:

- [Change the partition type from MBR to GPT](#change-the-partition-type-from-mbr-to-gpt).

- Take a full backup of the data on the disk and re-create the GPT.

### Change the partition type from MBR to GPT

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> - Take a [snapshot](/azure/virtual-machines/snapshot-copy-managed-disk) of the data disk before making any change. 
> - This change can only be done on a data disk, not an OS disk. If it's done on an OS disk, it will end up in a no boot situation.  
> - For Red Hat, [it isn't possible to convert the MSDOS label to GPT without losing data](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1261843).

#### Step 1: Identify the current partition table type

Use one of the following tools to check if the current data disk is MBR or GPT.

#### [fdisk](#tab/fdisk)

 ```bash
 sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdd | grep -i type
 ```

 ```output
 Disk label type: dos
 ```

#### [parted](#tab/parted)

 ```bash
 sudo parted /dev/sdd print | grep -i '^Partition Table'
 ```

 ```output
 Partition Table: msdos
 ```

#### [gdisk](#tab/gdisk)

```bash
sudo gdisk -l /dev/sdd | grep -A4 '^Partition table scan:'
```

```output
 Partition table scan: 
   MBR: MBR only
   BSD: not present
   APM: not present
   GPT: not present
 ```

---

#### Step 2: Re-create the partition

> [!NOTE]
> This section uses the `gdisk` tool to re-create the partition as an example.

1. Install the `gdisk` tool if it isn't installed in the Linux virtual machine:

    #### [Red Hat 7.x](#tab/rhel7)
    
    ```bash
    sudo yum install gdisk -y
    ```
    
    #### [Red Hat 8.x/9.x](#tab/rhel89)
    
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install gdisk -y
    ```
    
    #### [Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu)
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt -y install gdisk
    ```
    
    #### [SUSE](#tab/sles)
    
    ```bash
    sudo zypper install gdisk
    ```
    
    ---

2. Verify the current size of the data disk：

    ```bash
    sudo gdisk -l /dev/sdd | grep Disk | grep sectors
    ```
    
    ```output
    Disk /dev/sdd: 17179869184 sectors, 8.0 TiB
    ```

3. Stop the application running on the virtual machine and unmount the file system:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop myapp.service
    sudo umount /appext4
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > - Both `myapp.service` and `/appext4` are example entries. Replace them accordingly.
    > - If you need to increase the data disk size, you can do it now through your Azure account. A disk resizing in the Azure portal needs downtime. For more information, see [Expand an Azure Managed Disk](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=ubuntu#expand-an-azure-managed-disk).

4. Re-create the partition number 1 by using the `gdisk` command: 

    ```bash
    sudo gdisk /dev/sdd
    ```
    
    ```output
    GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.10

      BSD: not present
      APM: not present

    Warning: The kernel is still using the old partition table.
    The new table will be used at the next reboot.

    ```

5. Verify that the partition style is changed to GPT:

    ```bash
    sudo gdisk -l /dev/sdd | grep -A4 '^Partition table scan:'
    ```
    
    ```output
    Partition table scan:
      MBR: protective
      BSD: not present
      APM: not present
      GPT: present    
    ```
6. Check the size of the partition by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,RO,MOUNTPOINT
    ```

    ```output
    NAME              TYPE FSTYPE      LABEL  SIZE RO MOUNTPOINT
    sda               disk                     32G  0
    ├─sda1            part vfat               500M  0 /boot/efi
    ├─sda2            part xfs                500M  0 /boot
    ├─sda3            part xfs                 31G  0 /
    └─sda4            part                      2M  0
    sdb               disk                    256G  0
    └─sdb1            part ext4               256G  0 /mnt
    sdd               disk                      8T  0
    └─sdd1            part ext4                 2T  0 /appext4
    ```

7. Unmount the file system that was mounted automatically and repair it:

    ```bash
    sudo umount /appext4
    sudo fsck.ext4 -fy /dev/sdd1
    ```
    
    ```output
    e2fsck 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
    Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
    Pass 2: Checking directory structure
    Pass 3: Checking directory connectivity
    Pass 4: Checking reference counts
    Pass 5: Checking group summary information
    /dev/sdd1: 6728/134217728 files (0.2% non-contiguous), 8849024/536870655 blocks
    ```

8. Remount the file system:

    ```bash
    sudo mount /appext4
    ```

9. Resize the file system:
 
    If the file system is `ext4`, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo resize2fs /dev/sdd1
    ```

    ```output
    resize2fs 1.42.9 (28-Dec-2013)
    Filesystem at /dev/sdd1 is mounted on /appext4; on-line resizing required
    old_desc_blocks = 256, new_desc_blocks = 1024
    The filesystem on /dev/sdd1 is now 2147483387 blocks long.
    ```

    If the file system is `XFS`, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    sudo xfsgrowfs /dev/sdd1
    ```

10. Verify the new size:

    ```bash
    sudo lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,FSTYPE,LABEL,SIZE,RO,MOUNTPOINT
    ```

    ```output
    NAME              TYPE FSTYPE      LABEL  SIZE RO MOUNTPOINT
    sda               disk                     32G  0
    ├─sda1            part vfat               500M  0 /boot/efi
    ├─sda2            part xfs                500M  0 /boot
    ├─sda3            part xfs                 31G  0 /
    └─sda4            part                      2M  0
