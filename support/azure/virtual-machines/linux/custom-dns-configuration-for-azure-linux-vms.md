# Custom DNS configuration in Azure Linux Virtual Machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article provides instructions to configure custom DNS servers and search domains on Microsoft Azure Linux virtual machines (VMs).

> [!NOTE]
> This article uses DNS servers `1.2.3.4` and `5.6.7.8` and search domain `"test.example.com"` as examples. Replace these values with your actual DNS server addresses and search domain path.

## [RHEL 8._x_/9._x_](#tab/RHEL)

### Configure custom DNS servers
1. The initial configuration of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in an Azure Linux VM is as shown in the following screenshot.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/rhel-dns-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of default resolv.conf file in RHEL.":::
2. Configure custom DNS servers at the Azure virtual network or network interface level. For more information, see [Steps to change DNS servers at virtual network/network interface level](/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#change-dns-servers).

    > [!NOTE]
    > In Azure, you can set custom DNS servers at the virtual network level or the network interface level. If you set custom DNS servers at the network interface level, it will override the the custom DNS servers configuration in the virtual network.

3. Restart the `NetworkManager` service, and then check the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. The file should contain the DNS servers that you configured in the step 2.

    ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

    The following screenshot shows an example of `/etc/resolv.conf` after you configure the DNS servers.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/rhel-dns-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resolv.conf file post changing the DNS servers at portal level.":::

4. Run the following command to determinate whether the DNS servers are successfully added to the network interface:

    ```bash
    sudo systemd-resolve --status
    ```
    
   The following screenshot shows an example of the network interface after you configure the DNS servers.

### Configure search domains

1. To change the search domain, add the domain name as follows in `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf`. To specify multiple search domains, separate them by using commas (for example: `"test.example.com, test1.example.com, test2.example.com"`):
 
    ```config
    append domain-search "test.example.com";
    ```
     Example of `/etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf` file after you add the search domain:

    :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/rhel-dns-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of dhclient.conf file post modification.":::

2. Restart the `NetworkManager` service, and then check whether the search domain is updated in `/etc/resolv.conf`file:
    
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```
    The following screenshot shows an example of `/etc/resolv.conf` file after you configure the search domain.
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/rhel-dns-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resolv.conf file after restarting NM service.":::

3. Run the following command to determinate whether the search domain is successfully added to the network interface:

    ```bash
    sudo systemd-resolve --status
    ```

    The following screenshot shows an example of the network interface after you configure the search domain.

## [Ubuntu 20.04/22.04](#tab/Ubuntu)

### Configure DNS servers

1. The initial configuration of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in an Azure Ubuntu VM is as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/ubuntu-dns-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of default resolv.conf file in Ubuntu.":::

2. Configure custom DNS servers at the Azure virtual network or network interface level. For more information, see [Steps to change DNS servers at virtual network/network interface level](/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#change-dns-servers).

    > [!NOTE]
    > In Azure, you can set custom DNS servers at the virtual network level or the network interface level. If you set custom DNS servers at the network interface level, this will override the the custom DNS servers configuration in the virtual network.
3. Run the following command to apply the configuration of the custom DNS servers:

   ```bash
   sudo netplan apply

4. Check the `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf` file. The file should contain the DNS servers that you configured in step 2.
  
    Starting is Ubuntu 20, `resolv.conf` file is a symbolic link of `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf` file. This makes sure that the updated DNS servers are reflected in **/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf** file. For more information, see [systemd-resolved](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html#:~:text=systemd%2Dresolved%20is%20a%20system,an%20LLMNR%20resolver%20and%20responder).
    
   The following screenshot shows an example of `/run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf` after you configure custom DNS server.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/ubuntu-dns-3.png" alt-text="Screenshot of non-stub Resolv.conf file after you make changes at portal level":::

5. Run the following command to check whether the custom DNS servers are successfully added to the network interface:

   ```bash
   sudo resolvectl status
   ```

   The following screenshot shows an example of the network interface after you configure the search domain:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/ubuntu-dns-4.png" alt-text="Screenshot of resolvectl status command output.":::

### Configure search domains

1. Use a text editor (such as Nano or Vim) to create a YAML configuration file in the `/etc/netplan/` for the DNS servers. For example:

      ```
      sudo nano /etc/netplan/custom-dns-01.yaml
      ```

      or
   
      ```
      sudo vi /etc/netplan/custom-dns-01.yaml
      ```
   
3. Add the following configuration, and then save and exit. If youâ€™re use Nano, press `CTRL + O` to save and `CTRL + X` to exit. If you use Vim, press ESC, type `:wq`, and then press Enter to save and exit. 

    ```yaml
    network:
        ethernets:
          eth0:
            nameservers:
              search: [ test.example.com ]
    ```
    The configuration might conatin multiple search domains separated by commas. For example: '["test.example.com", "test1.example.com", "test2.example.com"]`.
4. Run the following command to apply the search domain changes:
  
   ```bash
   sudo netplan apply
   ```

5. View the `resolvectl` status to determinate whether the search domain is added successfully:

   ```bash
   sudo resolvectl status
   ```

### Configure DNS servers

1. The initial configuration of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file in an Azure SLES VM is as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/sles-dns-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of default resolv.conf file in SUSE.":::

2. Configure custom DNS servers at the Azure virtual network or network interface level. For more information, see [Steps to change DNS servers at virtual network/network interface level](/azure/virtual-network/manage-virtual-network#change-dns-servers).
    > [!NOTE]
    > In Azure, you can set custom DNS servers at the virtual network level or the network interface level. If you set custom DNS servers at the network interface level, this will override the custom DNS servers configuration in the virtual network.
3. Restart the `wicked.service`, and then check the `/etc/resolv.conf` file. The file should contain the DNS servers that you configured in step 2:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wicked.service
   ```

   :::image type="content" source="./media/custom-dns-config-images/sles-dns-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Resolv.conf after you restart wicked service.":::

### Configure search domains

1. Edit the `/etc/sysconfig/network/config` file.
1. Add a line for the search domain, as shown in the following example:

   ```config
   NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST="test.example.com"
   ```
   Multiple search domains can be declared by using a space separator, as follows:

   ```config
   NETCONFIG_DNS_STATIC_SEARCHLIST="test.example.com test1.example.com"
   ```
    
1. Restart `wicked.service` or update `netconfig`, and then check whether the search domain is updated in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wicked.service
   ```
    or

   ```bash
   sudo netconfig update
   ```
   The following screenshot is an example of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file after you configure the search domains.
