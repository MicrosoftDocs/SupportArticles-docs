# How to display encryption settings on Azure Linux Virtual Machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

When Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is enabled on an Azure Linux Virtual Machine (VM), encryption settings are configured at a platform level to either the disk object or the VM object. This guide shows how to visualize these encryption settings after ADE is deployed.

## Prerequisites

- Access to [the Azure portal Resource Explorer](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#view/HubsExtension/ArmExplorerBlade)
- Access to [Azure web Resource Explorer](https://resources.azure.com/)

## How to identify the ADE extension version

You can identify the ADE version in the Azure portal. To do this, open the properties of the VM, and then select `Extensions` to open the `Extensions` blade. On the `Extensions` blade, view the version number of **AzureDiskEncryptionForLinux**.

- If the version number is `0.*`, the disk uses **dual-pass encryption**.
- If the version number is `1.*` or a later version, the disk uses **single-pass encryption**.

If ADE single-pass is used, the extension process stamps the encryption settings on the disk object itself. If ADE dual-pass is used, encryption settings are stamped on the VM object.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use single-pass encryption instead of dual-pass encryption.

1. Log in to your subscription in [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Search for "Resource Explorer" on the search bar.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/how-to-display-encryption-settings-in-azure-vms/searchresourceexplorerportal.png" alt-text="Portal search bar":::

3. Select the "Resource Explorer" icon.
4. Select the subscription that you want to review.
5. Locate the disk that you want to review by using either by the resource group path or the provider path.

6. After the disk is selected, the corresponding JSON metadata is shown in the right panel. The encryption settings block is enclosed inside the `encryptionSettingsCollection` key. It resembles the following code:

    ```json
    "encryptionSettingsCollection": {
        "enabled": true,
        "encryptionSettings": [
            {
                "diskEncryptionKey": {
                    "sourceVault": {
                        "id": "/subscriptions/12345678-1234-4321-5678-987654321987/resourceGroups/RGName/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/KeyvaultName"
                    },
                    "secretUrl": "https://kevaultName.vault.azure.net/secrets/12345678-1234-4321-5678-987654321987/12345678998765432112345678998765"
                },
                "keyEncryptionKey": {
                    "sourceVault": {
                        "id": "/subscriptions/12345678-1234-4321-5678-987654321987/resourceGroups/RGName/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/KeyvaultName"
                    },
                    "keyUrl": "https://kevaultName.vault.azure.net/keys/kek/"
                }
            }
        ],
        "encryptionSettingsVersion": "1.1"
    }
    ```

- `encryptionSettingsCollection` - This value is set to `True` if the disk has encryption settings stamped.
- `encryptionSettings` - This value corresponds to the JSON array that contains the encryption settings on a disk.
- `sourceVault` - This value is the complete URL of the key vault that's used for ADE.
- `secretUrl` - This value is the complete URL of the secret that's generated during encryption.
- `keyEncryptionKey` - This value is optional. If you used [Key Encryption Key (KEK)](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview#terminology), the URL of the wrapping key is listed in this section.
- `encryptionSettingsVersion` - The extension (ADE) version that's used to encrypt the disk.
  - If the version number is `0.*`, the disk uses dual-pass encryption.
  - If the version number is `1.*` or a later version, the disk uses single-pass encryption.

The first version of ADE relied on Microsoft Entra ID for authentication (dual-pass). The current version of ADE doesn't rely on Entra ID (single-pass). We strongly encourage you to use the current version.

If you're already using the dual-pass version of ADE, the encryption settings are shown in the VM component.

## Verify ADE encryption settings through Azure Web Resource Explorer

You can access the web version of Resource Explorer through [this link](https://resources.azure.com). Follow steps 1 through 6 in []"Verify ADE encryption settings through Azure portal"](#portal) to locate the component that ou want to analyze.

## Next steps

For more information, see [the ADE documentation](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disk-encryption-overview).
