# Azure Linux virtual machine fails to boot after applying kernel changes

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

[!INCLUDE [CentOS End Of Life](../../../includes/centos-end-of-life-note.md)]

This article provides solutions to an issue in which a Linux virtual machine (VM) can't boot after applying kernel changes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure the [serial console](serial-console-linux.md) is enabled and functional in the Linux VM.

## <a id="identify-kernel-boot-issue"></a>How to identify kernel-related boot issue

To identify a kernel-related boot issue, check the specific kernel panic string. To do this, use the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/serial-console#az-serial-console-connect) or the Azure portal to view the serial console log output of the VM in the boot diagnostics pane or serial console pane.

A kernel panic looks like the following output and will show up at the end of the serial console log:

```output
Probing EDD (edd=off to disable)... ok
Memory KASLR using RDRAND RDTSC...
[  300.206297] Kernel panic - xxxxxxxx
[  300.207216] CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Tainted: G               ------------ T 3.xxx.x86_64 #1
```

## <a id="online-troubleshooting"></a>Online troubleshooting

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM, [restore the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot issue.

The serial console is the fastest method to resolve the boot issue. It allows you to directly fix the issue without having to present the system disk to a recovery VM. Make sure you meet the necessary prerequisites for your distribution. For more information, see [Virtual machine serial console for Linux](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/serial-console#access-serial-console-for-linux).  

1. [Identify the specific kernel-related boot issue](#identify-kernel-boot-issue).

2. Use the [Azure serial console](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/serial-console#access-serial-console-for-linux) to interrupt your VM at the GRUB menu and select any previous kernel to boot it up. For more information, see [Boot system on older kernel version](#bootingup-differentkernel-ASC).

3. Go to the corresponding section to resolve the specific kernel-related boot issue:

    - [Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)](#missing-initramfs)
    - [Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!](#attempted-tokill-init)
    - [Other kernel-related boot issues](#other-kernel-boot-issues)

4. After the kernel-related boot issue is resolved, restart the VM so it can boot over the latest kernel version.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM, [restore the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot issue.

If the [Azure serial console](serial-console-linux.md) doesn't work in the specific VM or isn't an option in your subscription, troubleshoot the boot issue by using a rescue/repair VM. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Use [vm repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md) to create a repair VM that has a copy of the affected VM's OS disk attached. Mount the copy of the OS file systems in the repair VM by using [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Alternatively, you can create a rescue VM manually by using the Azure portal. For more information, see [Troubleshoot a Linux VM by attaching the OS disk to a recovery VM using the Azure portal](troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux.md).

2. [Identify the specific kernel-related boot issue](#identify-kernel-boot-issue).

3. Go to the corresponding section to resolve the specific kernel-related boot issue:

    - [Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)](#missing-initramfs)
    - [Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init!](#attempted-tokill-init)
    - [Other kernel-related boot issues](#other-kernel-boot-issues)

4. After the kernel-related boot issue is resolved, perform the following actions:

    1. Exit chroot.
    2. Unmount the copy of the file systems from the rescue/repair VM.
    3. Run the `az vm repair restore` command to swap the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM. For more information, see Step 5 in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md#repair-process-example).
    4. Validate if the VM is able to boot up by taking a look at the Azure serial console or by trying to connect to the VM.

5. If there are important kernel-related contents, the entire `/boot` partition, or other important contents are missing, and they can't be recovered, we recommend restoring the VM from a backup. For more information, see [How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

## <a id="bootingup-differentkernel"></a>Boot system on older kernel version

### <a id="bootingup-differentkernel-ASC"></a>Use Azure serial console

1. Restart the VM by using the [Azure serial console](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/serial-console#access-serial-console-for-linux).

    1. Select the **shutdown** button at the top of the serial console window.
    2. Select the **Restart VM (Hard)** option.

2. Once the serial console connection resumes, you'll see a countdown counter at the left top corner of the serial console window. Press the **ESCAPE** key to interrupt your VM at the GRUB menu.

3. Press the down arrow key to select any previous kernel version.

4. Change the `GRUB_DEFAULT` variable in the */etc/default/grub* file as instructed in [Change default kernel version manually](#bootingup-differentkernel-ARVMManual). This is a persistent change.

> [!NOTE]
> If there's only one kernel version listed in the GRUB menu, follow the [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting) approach to troubleshoot this issue from a repair VM.

### <a id="bootingup-differentkernel-ARVMALAR"></a>Use repair VM (ALAR scripts)

1. Run the following bash command in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) to create a repair VM. For more information, see [Use Azure Linux Auto Repair (ALAR) to fix a Linux VM - kernel option](repair-linux-vm-using-ALAR.md#kernel).

    ```azurecli
    az vm repair create --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME --repair-username rescue --repair-password 'password!234' --copy-disk-name repairdiskcopy
    ```

2. Run the following command to replace the broken kernel with the previously installed version:

    ```azurecli
    az vm repair run --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME --run-id linux-alar2 --parameters kernel --run-on-repair
    
    az vm repair restore --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> If there is only one kernel version installed in the system, follow the [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting) approach to troubleshoot this issue from a repair VM.

### <a id="bootingup-differentkernel-ARVMManual"></a>Change default kernel version manually

To modify the default kernel version from a repair VM (inside chroot) or on a running VM, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> If a kernel downgrade rollback is done, select the most recent kernel version instead of the older one.

- **RHEL 7, Oracle Linux 7, and CentOS 7**

    1. Validate the list of available kernels in the GRUB configuration file by running one of the following commands:
    
        - **Gen1 VMs:**
    
            ```bash
            cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep menuentry
            ```
    
        - **Gen2 VMs:**
    
            ```bash
            cat /boot/efi/EFI/*/grub.cfg | grep menuentry
            ```
    
    2. Set the new default kernel and specify the corresponding kernel title by running the following command:
    
        ```bash
        # grub2-set-default 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, with Linux 3.10.0-123.el7.x86_64'
        ```
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > Replace `Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, with Linux 3.10.0-123.el7.x86_64` with the corresponding menu entry title.
    
    3. Validate that the new default kernel is the desired one by running the following command:
    
        ```bash
        grub2-editenv list
        ```
    
    4. Make sure the value of the `GRUB_DEFAULT` variable in the */etc/default/grub* file is set to `saved`. To modify it, make sure you [regenerate the GRUB configuration file](troubleshoot-vm-boot-error.md#reinstall-grub-regenerate-grub-configuration-file) to apply the changes.

- **RHEL 8/9 and CentOS 8**

    1. List the available kernels by running the following command:
    
        ```bash
        ls -l /boot/vmlinuz-*
        ```
    
    2. Set the new default kernel by running the following command:
    
        ```bash
        grubby --set-default /boot/vmlinuz-4.18.0-372.19.1.el8_6.x86_64
        ```
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > Replace `4.18.0-372.19.1.el8_6.x86_64` with the corresponding kernel version.
    
    3. Validate that the new default kernel is the desired one by running the following command:
    
        ```bash
        grubby --default-kernel
        ```

- **SLES 12/15, Ubuntu 18.04/20.04**

    1. List the available kernels in the GRUB configuration file by running the following command:

        - **Gen1 VMs:**
            
          - **SLES 12/15**:
            
            ```bash
            cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg | grep menuentry
            ```
            
          - **Ubuntu 18.04/20.04**:
            
            ```bash
            cat /boot/grub/grub.cfg | grep menuentry
            ```
            
        - **Gen2 VMs:**
    
            ```bash
            cat /boot/efi/EFI/*/grub.cfg | grep menuentry
            ```

    2. Set the new default kernel by modifying the value of the `GRUB_DEFAULT` variable in the */etc/default/grub* file. For the most recent kernel version installed in the system, the default value is 0. The next available kernel is set to "1>2".
    
        ```bash
        vi /etc/default/grub
        GRUB_DEFAULT="1>2"
        ```
    
        > [!NOTE]
        > For more information about how to configure the `GRUB_DEFAULT` variable, see [SUSE Boot Loader GRUB2](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/cha-grub2.html) and [Ubuntu Grub2/Setup](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup). As a reference: the top level menuentry value is 0, the first top level submenu value is 1, and each nested menuentry value starts with 0. For example, "1>2" is the third menuentry from the first submenu.

    3. Regenerate the GRUB configuration file to apply the changes. Follow the instructions in [Reinstall GRUB and regenerate GRUB configuration file](troubleshoot-vm-boot-error.md#reinstall-grub-regenerate-grub-configuration-file) for the corresponding Linux distribution and VM generation.

## <a id="missing-initramfs"></a>Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

This error occurs because of a recent system update (kernel). It's most commonly seen in RHEL-based distributions.
You can [identify this issue from the Azure serial console](#identify-kernel-boot-issue). You'll see any of the following error messages:

1. "Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)"

    ```output

2. "error: file '/initramfs-*.img' not found"

    > error: file '/initramfs-3.10.0-1160.36.2.el7.x86_64.img' not found.

This kind of error indicates that the initramfs file isn't generated, the GRUB configuration file has the initrd entry missing after a patching process, or a GRUB manual misconfiguration.

Before rebooting a server, we recommend validating the GRUB configuration and `/boot` contents if there's a kernel update by running one of the following commands. It's important to ensure the update is done and there are no missing initramfs files.

- **BIOS based - Gen1 systems**

    ```bash
    # ls -l /boot
    # cat /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    ```

- **UEFI based - Gen2 systems**

    ```bash
    # ls -l /boot
    # cat /boot/efi/EFI/*/grub.cfg
    ```

### <a id="missing-initramfs-alar"></a>Regenerate missing initramfs by using Azure Repair VM ALAR scripts

1. Create a repair VM by running the following Bash command line with [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview). For more information, see [Use Azure Linux Auto Repair (ALAR) to fix a Linux VM - initrd option](repair-linux-vm-using-ALAR.md#initrd).

    ```azurecli
    az vm repair create --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME --repair-username rescue --repair-password 'password!234' --copy-disk-name repairdiskcopy
    ```

2. Regenerate the initrd/initramfs image and regenerate the GRUB configuration file if it has the initrd entry missing. To do this, run the following command:

    ```azurecli
    az vm repair run --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME --run-id linux-alar2 --parameters initrd --run-on-repair
    
    az vm repair restore --verbose -g $RGNAME -n $VMNAME
    ```

3. Once the restore command has been executed, restart the original VM and validate that it's able to boot up.

### <a id="missing-initramfs-manual"></a>Regenerate missing initramfs manually

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - If you're able to boot the VM up by using a previous kernel version or inside chroot from the repair/rescue VM, regenerate missing initramfs manually.
> - To regenerate missing initramfs manually from a repair VM, make sure that step 1 in [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting) has already been followed, and those commands are executed inside [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md).

1. Identify the specific kernel version that has issues with booting. You can extract the version information from the corresponding kernel panic error.

    Refer to the following screenshot as an example. The kernel panic error shows that the kernel version is "3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64":

    :::image type="content" source="media/kernel-related-boot-issues/missing-initramfs.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to identify the specific kernel version that has the missing initramfs image.":::

2. Regenerate the missing initramfs file by running one of the following commands:

    - **RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7/8**

        ```bash
        sudo depmod -a 3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64
        sudo dracut -f /boot/initramfs-3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64.img 3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64
        ```

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Replace `3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64` with the corresponding kernel version.

    - **SLES 12/15**

        ```bash
        sudo depmod -a 5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure
        sudo dracut -f /boot/initrd-5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure 5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure
        ```

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Replace `5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure` with the corresponding kernel version.

    - **Ubuntu 18.04**

        ```bash
        sudo depmod -a 5.4.0-1077-azure
        sudo mkinitramfs -k -o /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-1077-azure
        ```

        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Replace `5.4.0-1077-azure` with the corresponding kernel version.

3. Regenerate the GRUB configuration file. Follow the instructions in [Reinstall GRUB and regenerate GRUB configuration file](troubleshoot-vm-boot-error.md#reinstall-grub-regenerate-grub-configuration-file) for the corresponding Linux distribution and VM generation

4. If the steps above are performed from a repair VM, follow step 3 in [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting). If the steps above are performed from the Azure Serial console, follow the [Online troubleshooting](#online-troubleshooting) method.

5. Reboot your VM over the most recent kernel version.

## <a id="attempted-tokill-init"></a>Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempted to kill init

[Identify this issue from the Azure serial console](#identify-kernel-boot-issue). You'll see output like the following:

```output
dracut Warning: Boot has failed. To debug this issue add "rdshell" to the kernel command line.

 [<ffffffff8156427e>] ? system_call_after_swapgs+0xae/0x152
```

This kind of kernel panic occurs due to the following possible causes:

- [Missing important files and directories](#attempted-tokill-init-missingfilesdirs).

- [Missing important system core libraries and packages](#attempted-tokill-init-missinglibraries)

- [Wrong file permissions](#attempted-tokill-init-wrongpermissions)

- [Missing partitions](#attempted-tokill-init-missingpartitions)

- [SELinux issues](#attempted-tokill-init-selinuxissues)

See the following sections for cause details and solutions. Make sure that the commands are executed from a repair/rescue VM inside a chroot environment as instructed in [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting).

### <a id="attempted-tokill-init-missingfilesdirs"></a> Missing important files and directories

Important Linux files and directories are missing due to a human error. For example, files are accidentally deleted or file system corruption.

1. Validate the OS disk contents after attaching the copy of the OS disk to a repair VM and mounting the corresponding file systems by using [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md). You can compare the outputs with the ones from a working VM running the same OS version.

    ```bash
    ls -l /
    ls -l /usr/lib
    ls -l /usr/lib64
    ls -lR / | more
    ```

2. Restore the missing files from a backup. For more information, see [Recover files from Azure virtual machine backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-restore-files-from-vm). Depending on the number of missing files, it might be better to do a full VM restore. For more information, see [How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

### <a id="attempted-tokill-init-missinglibraries"></a>Missing important system core libraries and packages

Important system core libraries, files, or packages are deleted from the system or got corrupted. To resolve this issue, reinstall the affected libraries, files, or packages. This solution works on RPM-based distributions like Red Hat/CentOS/SUSE VMs. For other Linux distributions, we recommend [restoring the VM from backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

To perform the reinstallation, follow these steps:

1. Create a rescue VM by using a raw image with the same OS version and generation as the affected VM.

2. Access the [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md) environment in the rescue VM to troubleshoot the issue.

    ```bash
    sudo chroot /rescue
    ```
    
    The command output will indicate which library is missing or corrupted, as shown below:
    
    ```output
    /bin/bash: error while loading shared libraries: libc.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
    ```

3. Verify all system packages and their corresponding status in the rescue VM. Compare the output against a healthy VM running the same OS version.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm --verify --all --root=/rescue 
    ```
    Here's an example of the command output:
    
    ```output
    error: Failed to dlopen /usr/lib64/rpm-plugins/systemd_inhibit.so /lib64/librt.so.1: undefined symbol: __pthread_attr_copy, version GLIBC_PRIVATE

    S.5....T.  c /etc/security/pwquality.conf
    ```
 
    The output line `missing /lib64/libc-2.28.so` is related to the previous error in step 2, and it indicates the *libc-2.28.so* package is missing. However, the *libc-2.28.so* package can be modified. In this case, the output will show `.M.....` instead of `missing`. The *libc-2.28.so* package is referenced as an example in the following steps.

4. In the rescue VM, verify which package contains the library */lib64/libc-2.28.so*.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -qf /lib64/libc-2.28.so
    ```

    ```output
    glibc-2.28-127.0.1.el8.x86_64
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > The output will show the package that needs to be reinstalled, including the package name and version. The package version might be different from the one installed on the affected VM.

5. In the affected VM, verify which version of the *glibc* package is installed.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -qa --all --root=/rescue | grep -i glibc
    ```

    ```output
    glibc-common-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64
    glibc-gconv-extra-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64
    glibc-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64     <----  
    glibc-langpack-en-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64
    ```

6. Download the package *glibc-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64*. You can download it from the official website of the OS vendor or from the rescue VM by using a package management tool like `yumdownloader` or `zypper install --download-only <packagename>` depending on the OS you're running.

    Here's an example of using the `yumdownloader` tool:

    ```bash
    cd /tmp
    sudo yumdownloader glibc-2.28-211.0.1.el8.x86_64
    ```

    ```output

    ```

7. Reinstall the affected package in the rescue VM.

    ```bash
    sudo rpm -ivh --root=/rescue /tmp/glibc-*.rpm --replacepkgs --replacefiles
    ```

    ```output

    ```

8. Access the chroot environment in the rescue VM to validate the reinstallation.

    ```bash
    sudo chroot /rescue
    ```

9. Turn off the rescue VM and swap the OS disk to the affected VM.

### <a id="attempted-tokill-init-wrongpermissions"></a> Wrong file permissions

Wrong system wide file permissions are modified due to a human error (for example, someone runs `chmod 777` on */* or other important OS file systems). To resolve this issue, restore the file permissions. This solution works on RPM-based distributions like Red Hat/CentOS/SUSE VMs. For other Linux distributions, we recommend [restoring the VM from backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

To restore the file permissions, run the following command after attaching the copy of the OS disk to a repair VM and mounting the corresponding file systems by using [chroot](chroot-environment-linux.md):

```bash
rpm -a --setperms
rpm --setugids --all
chmod u+s /bin/sudo
chmod 660 /etc/sudoers.d/*
chmod 644 /etc/ssh/*.pub
chmod 640 /etc/ssh/*.key
```

> [!NOTE]
> Don't run this command on running production systems.

If the issue still exists after manually recovering the corresponding file permissions, perform a [restore from backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

### <a id="attempted-tokill-init-missingpartitions"></a> Missing partitions

In cases where `/usr`, `/opt`, `/var`, `/home`, `/tmp`, and `/` file systems are spread across different partitions, the data may be inaccessible because of issues at the partitions level, which might be caused by mistakes during partition resize operations or others.

In this scenario, if you document the original partition table layout, with the exact start and end sectors for each of the original partitions, and no further modifications are done on the system, like new file systems creation, recreate the partitions by using the same original layout with tools like **fdisk** (for MBR partition tables) or **gdisk** (for GPT partition tables) to gain access to the missing file system.

If this approach doesn't work, perform a [restore from backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

### <a id="attempted-tokill-init-selinuxissues"></a> SELinux issues

Wrong SELinux permissions might prevent the system from accessing important files. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. To verify if the system has issues due to wrong SELinux permissions, start the system with SELinux disabled by adding the **selinux=0** kernel option to the GRUB linux16 line.

2. If the system is able to boot up, run the following command to trigger a SELinux relabel at boot time and reboot the system:

    ```bash
    touch /.autorelabel
    ```

3. If the VM still can't boot, do a full VM restore from backup. For more information, see [How to restore Azure VM data in Azure portal](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms).

## <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues"></a>Other kernel-related boot issues

This article covers the most common Linux kernel panics identified in Azure. For more information about common kernel panic scenarios, see [Kernel panic in Azure Linux VMs - Common kernel panic events](linux-kernel-panic-troubleshooting.md#how-to-identify-a-kernel-panic).

There are some other important possible kernel panics that might cause no boot or no secure shell (SSH) scenarios.

Make sure you execute any commands from a repair VM inside a chroot environment, as instructed in [Offline troubleshooting](#offline-troubleshooting). If the system is already booted up over a previous kernel version, these commands can also be executed from the original VM by using root privileges or `sudo`, as instructed in [Online troubleshooting](#online-troubleshooting).

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelupgrade"></a> Recent kernel upgrade

If the kernel panics start after a recent kernel upgrade, boot the VM over the previous kernel version. For more information, see [Boot system on older kernel version](#bootingup-differentkernel).

You could also check if there's already a newer kernel version released by the Linux distribution vendor and install it. For more information about how to install the latest kernel version, see [Kernel update process](#other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelupdate).

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-kerneldowngrade"></a> Recent kernel downgrade

If the kernel panics start after a recent kernel downgrade, return to the latest installed kernel. You could also check if there's already a newer kernel version released by the Linux distribution vendor and install it. For more information about how to install the latest kernel version, see [Kernel update process](#other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelupdate).

To boot the system over the most recent kernel version, follow the instructions in [Change the default kernel version manually](#bootingup-differentkernel-ARVMManual), but select the first kernel listed in the GRUB menu. In a manual modification, you could set the `GRUB_DEFAULT` value to 0 and regenerate the corresponding GRUB configuration file.

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelmodulechanges"></a> Kernel module changes

You might experience a kernel panic that's related to a new kernel module or a missing kernel module. To get details about the specific kernel module that causes issues (if any), check the corresponding kernel panic trace.

To validate the loaded kernel modules and the disabled ones in _/etc/modprobe.d/*.conf_ files, run one of the following commands:

- **RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7/8**

    ```bash
    lsinitrd /boot/initramfs-3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64.img
    lsmod
    cat /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace `3.10.0-1160.59.1.el7.x86_64` with the corresponding kernel version.

- **SLES 12/15**

    ```bash
    lsinitrd /boot/initrd-5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure
    lsmod
    cat /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace `5.3.18-150300.38.53-azure` with the corresponding kernel version.

- **Ubuntu 18.04**

    ```bash
    lsinitramfs /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-1077-azure
    lsmod
    cat /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Replace `5.4.0-1077-azure` with the corresponding kernel version.

To remove any specific kernel module, run the following command and [regenerate the initramfs](#missing-initramfs-manual) if needed.

```bash
rmmod <kernel_module_name>
```

If a system service uses the specific kernel module, disable it by running the `systemctl disable <serviceName>` or `systemctl stop <serviceName>` command.

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-OSchanges"></a> Operating system recent configuration changes

Identify any recent kernel configuration changes that might cause issues. To resolve the issues, adjust those settings or roll back the configuration changes.

Run the following command to find persistent kernel parameters configured in any of the following files:

```bash
cat /etc/systctl.conf
cat /etc/sysctl.d/*
```

Run the following command to analyze the current kernel parameters and their current values:

```bash
sysctl -a
```

> [!NOTE]
> Run this command on a running system and not from a chroot environment.

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-missingfiles"></a> Possible missing files

For more information about this kind of issue, see [Missing important files and directories](#attempted-tokill-init-missingfilesdirs).

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-wrongfilespermission"></a> Wrong permissions on files

For more information about this kind of issue, see [Wrong file permissions](#attempted-tokill-init-wrongpermissions).

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-missingpartitions"></a> Missing partitions

For more information about this kind of issue, see [Missing partitions](#attempted-tokill-init-missingpartitions).

### <a id="other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelbugs"></a> Kernel bugs

[Identify this issue from the Azure serial console](#identify-kernel-boot-issue). This kind of issue will look like the following output:

```output
[5275698.017004] kernel BUG at XXX/YYY.c:72!
[5275698.017004] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP
```

This kind of kernel panic is associated with kernel bugs or third-party kernel bugs.

To fix kernel bugs, search the vendor Knowledge Base by using the kernel BUG string and look for known issues in the corresponding kernel version your system is running. Here are some important vendor resources:

- [Red Hat Kernel Oops Analyzer](https://access.redhat.com/labs/kerneloopsanalyzer/)

    This tool is designed to help you diagnose a kernel crash. When you input a text, *vmcore-dmesg.txt*, or a file including one or more kernel oops messages, it will walk you through diagnosing the kernel crash issue.

- [Red Hat knowledge base](https://access.redhat.com/search/#/)
  
    To get access to the Red Hat resources, link your Microsoft Azure and Red Hat accounts. For more information, see [How Microsoft Azure Customers Can Access the Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/articles/3189332).

- [SUSE knowledge base](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/help/)

- [Ubuntu knowledge base](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bugs)

We recommend keeping all your systems up to date to rule out any possible bugs already fixed in the most recent kernel versions. For more information, see [Kernel update process](#other-kernel-boot-issues-kernelupdate).

If further analysis is required from the vendor, configure and enable kdump to generate a core dump:
* [Kdump configuration in Red Hat based VMs](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3091051).
* [Kernel crash dump configuration in Ubuntu VMs](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/kernel-crash-dump).
* [Kernel core dump configuration in SLES VMs](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000016171)
