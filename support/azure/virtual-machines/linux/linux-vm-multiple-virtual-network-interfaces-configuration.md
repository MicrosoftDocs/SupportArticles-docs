# Configure multiple network interfaces in Azure Linux virtual machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

[!INCLUDE [CentOS End Of Life](../../../includes/centos-end-of-life-note.md)]

This article discusses how to configure multiple virtual network interfaces in Azure Linux virtual machines (VMs) that run the most common Linux distributions.

## Summary

You can create an Azure VM that has multiple network interfaces attached to it. A common scenario is to have different subnets for front-end and back-end connectivity, or a network that's dedicated to a monitoring or backup solution.

This article provides the required configuration for multiple network interfaces to work in an Azure Linux VM that's based on the following sample scenario:

- The VM has two or more network interfaces in the same subnet.
- The VM has two or more network interfaces in different subnets but in the same Virtual Network (VNET).

For details, see the following screenshots:

In each scenario, the connectivity can be tested from any VM in the same VNET.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This same process could also be followed in VMs with more than two NICs.

## Configure guest OS for multiple network interfaces

When you add multiple network interfaces to a Linux VM, you have to create routing rules. These rules enable the VM to send and receive traffic that belongs to a specific network interface. Otherwise, traffic can't be processed correctly. For example, traffic that belongs to *eth1* can't be processed correctly by the defined default route.

The following sections provides the required configuration for two network interfaces to work in Linux VMs that run the most common Linux distributions.

> [!NOTE]
> Run all the commands in the following sections by using root privileges (by switching to the root or by using the `sudo` command utility).

In each section, assume that the VM has two network interfaces that have any of the following settings:

- Routing (the output of the `sudo ip route show` command):

  - Two NICs in the same subnet:

    ```output
    default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100
    10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.1.4 metric 100
    10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.1.5 metric 101
    168.63.129.16 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
    169.254.169.254 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
    ```

  - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

    ```output
    default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto static metric 100
    10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.1.4 metric 100
    10.0.2.0/24 dev eth1 proto kernel scope link src 10.0.2.5 metric 101
    168.63.129.16 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
    169.254.169.254 via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 proto dhcp metric 100
    ```

- Interfaces (the output of the `sudo ip address show` command):

  - Two NICs in the same subnet:

    ```output
    lo: inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
    eth0: inet 10.0.1.4/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global eth0
    eth1: inet 10.0.1.5/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global eth1
    ```

  - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

    ```output
    lo: inet 127.0.0.1/8 scope host lo
    eth0: inet 10.0.1.4/24 brd 10.0.1.255 scope global eth0
    eth1: inet 10.0.2.5/24 brd 10.0.2.255 scope global eth1
    ```

## [RHEL/CentOS 7._x_](#tab/rhel7)

1. Add two routing tables to the */etc/iproute2/rt_tables* file by running the following commands (you need one entry per NIC):

    ```bash
    sudo echo "200 eth0-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    sudo echo "201 eth1-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    ```

    If more network interfaces are attached to the VM, add extra routing tables (for example, *202 eth2-rt*, *203 eth3-rt*, and so on).

2. Make sure a configuration file exists for each network interface in the */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/* directory. You can create new network interface configuration files based on the *ifcfg-eth0* configuration file (modify the `DEVICE` line and remove the `DHCP_HOSTNAME` and `HWADDR` lines from the new file). To do this, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 > /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    sudo sed -i 's/DEVICE=eth0/DEVICE=eth1/' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    sudo sed -i '/DHCP_HOSTNAME/d' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    sudo sed -i '/HWADDR/d' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    ```

3. To make the change persistent and applied during network stack activation, edit the files */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0* and */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1* (*ifcfg-eth2*, *ifcfg-eth3*, and so on, if the VM has more than two network interfaces) and change the value of `NM_CONTROLLED` from `yes` to `no`. To do this, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo cp -rp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 /tmp/ifcfg-eth0.bkp
    sudo cp -rp /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1 /tmp/ifcfg-eth1.bkp
    sudo sed -i 's/NM_CONTROLLED=yes/NM_CONTROLLED=no/' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
    sudo sed -i 's/NM_CONTROLLED=yes/NM_CONTROLLED=no/' /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Verify that the `NM_CONTROLLED=no` line is added to both the */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0* and */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1* files by using the `cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth*` command. If the line isn't in the files, add it manually by using the `sudo echo "NM_CONTROLLED=no" >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0` and `sudo echo "NM_CONTROLLED=no" >> /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1` commands.

4. After modifying this configuration, restart network services to apply the changes by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart network
    ```

5. Create corresponding rule and route files by using any text editor (in the following examples, the vi editor is used), and add appropriate rules and routes to each file. Use the following steps to create one set of *rule-eth#* and *route-eth#* files per network interface. Replace the IP address and subnet information accordingly in every step. If you have more network interfaces, create the same set of *rule-eth#* and *route-eth#* files for each interface by using the corresponding IP address, network, and gateway details.

    - Create rules and routes for *eth0*:

      1. To create the rule file for *eth0*, open the file */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth0*.

          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth0
          ```

      2. Add the following content to the rule file. Replace the IP address accordingly, make sure you specify the IPv4 address in the configuration, and preserve the 32-bit value:

          ```output
          from 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
          to 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
          ```

      3. To create the route file for *eth0*, open the file */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0*.

          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0
          ```

      4. Add the following content to the route file. Replace the network and gateway values accordingly.

          ```output
          10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
          default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
          ```

    - Create rules and routes for *eth1*:

      1. To create the rule file for *eth1*, open the file */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth1*.

            ```bash
            sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth1
            ```

      2. Add the following content to the rule file. Replace the IP address accordingly, make sure that you specify the IPv4 address in the command, and preserve the 32-bit value.

          - Two NICs in the same subnet:

            ```output
            from 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
            to 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
            ```

          - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

             ```output
             from 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
             to 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
             ```

      3. To create the route file for *eth1*, open the file */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth1*.

            ```bash
            sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth1
            ```

      4. Add the following content to the route file. Replace the network and gateway values accordingly.

          - Two NICs in the same subnet:

            ```output
            10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            ```

          - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

            ```output
            10.0.2.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            default via 10.0.2.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            ```

6. To apply the changes, run the following command to restart the network service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart network
    ```

    The routing rules are now correctly set, and connectivity should work from any network interface. You can test the connectivity by using Secure Shell (SSH) or pinging both IPs from a VM in the same VNET.

7. Verify that the current routes and rules are loaded by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo ip route show
    sudo ip rule show
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you still have issues communicating with the second NIC, restart the VM by using the `sudo reboot` command, repeat step 7, and test the connectivity again.

## [RHEL/CentOS 8._x_](#tab/rhel8)

1. By default, policy routing isn't installed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)/CentOS 8.*x*. To configure multiple network interfaces, install and enable the policy routing. To do this, run the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo yum install NetworkManager-dispatcher-routing-rules -y
    sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
    sudo systemctl start NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
    ```

2. In RHEL/CentOS 8.*x*, the `NM_CONTROLLED` setting is set to `yes` in each network configuration file (*/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth#*) by default. To avoid issues, make sure this setting isn't set to `no` in your specific configuration file. Also, make sure that a corresponding network configuration file is created per each network interface. The following is the sample configuration for network configuration files:

    - */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0*:

        ```bash
        sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
        ```

        ```output
        DEVICE=eth0
        ONBOOT=yes
        BOOTPROTO=dhcp
        TYPE=Ethernet
        USERCTL=no
        PEERDNS=yes
        IPV6INIT=no
        PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes
        ```

    - */etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1*:

        ```bash
        sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
        ```

        ```output
        DEVICE=eth1
        ONBOOT=yes
        BOOTPROTO=dhcp
        TYPE=Ethernet
        USERCTL=no
        PEERDNS=yes
        IPV6INIT=no
        PERSISTENT_DHCLIENT=yes
        ```

3. Run the following commands to add two routing tables to the */etc/iproute2/rt_tables* file:

    ```bash
    sudo echo "200 eth0-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    sudo echo "201 eth1-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    ```

    If more network interfaces are attached to the VM, add extra routing tables (for example, *202 eth2-rt*, *203 eth3-rt*, and so on).

4. Create the corresponding rules and routes configuration files for each of your NICs, and add the appropriate rules and routes to each. To create one set of *rule-eth#* and *route-eth#* files per network interface, follow the steps below. Replace the IP address and subnet information accordingly in every step. If you have more network interfaces, create the same set of *rule-eth#* and *route-eth#* files for each interface by using the corresponding IP and subnet details.

    - Create rules and routes for *eth0*:

      1. Create the rule file for *eth0* by running the following command:

          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth0
          ```

      2. Add the following content to the rule file. Replace the IP address accordingly, and make sure that you specify the IPv4 address in the command.

          ```output
          from 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
          to 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
          ```

      3. Create the route file for *eth0* by running the following command:
  
          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0
          ```

      4. Add the following content to the route file:

          ```output
          10.0.1.0/24 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
          default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
          ```

    - Create rules and routes for *eth1*:

      1. Create the rule file for *eth1* by running the following command:

          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/rule-eth1
          ```

      2. Add the following content to the rule file. Replace the IP address accordingly, make sure that you specify the IPv4 address in the command, and preserve the 32-bit value.

         - Two NICs in the same subnet:

           ```output
           from 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
           to 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
           ```

         - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

           ```output
           from 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
           to 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
           ```

      3. Create the route file for *eth1* by running the following command:

          ```bash
          sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth1
          ```

      4. Add the following content to the route file:

         - Two NICs in the same subnet:

            ```output
            10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            ```

         - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

            ```output
            10.0.2.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            default via 10.0.2.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
            ```

5. To apply the changes, restart the network service by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
    ```

    The routing rules are now correctly set, and connectivity should work from any network interface. You can test the connectivity by using Secure Shell (SSH) or pinging both IPs from a VM in the same VNET.

6. Verify that the current routes and rules are loaded by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo ip route show
    sudo ip rule show
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you still don't have connectivity to the second NIC, restart the VM by using the `sudo reboot` command, repeat step 6, and test the connectivity again.

## [Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04](#tab/ubuntu)

1. Add two routing tables to the */etc/iproute2/rt_tables* file by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo echo "200 eth0-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    sudo echo "201 eth1-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    ```

    If more network interfaces are attached to the VM, add extra routing tables (for example, *202 eth2-rt*, *203 eth3-rt*, and so on).

2. If Cloud-Init automation is set (by default, it's set in the Azure Ubuntu images), make sure that the network CI automation is disabled so that the */etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml* file doesn't get overwritten every time the system is restarted.

    Create the */etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg* file by using the following command and content:

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/99-disable-network-config.cfg
    ```

    ```yaml
    network:
       config: disabled
    ```

3. Modify the netplan configuration file */etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml* by using any text editor, and include the following routes and policy-routing blocks for each network interface section:

    ```yaml
    routes:
     - to: <subnet>/24
       via: <gatewayIP>
       metric: 200
       table: 201
     - to: 0.0.0.0/0
       via: <gatewayIP>
       table: <routingTableID>
    routing-policy:
     - from: <NICIP>/32
       table: <routingTableID>
     - to: <NICIP>/32
       table: <routingTableID>
    ```

    Replace the subnet, MAC address, and IP address information for each network interface (*eth0* and *eth1*) accordingly. Make sure the 32-bit value is preserved in the `routing-policy` block.

    Here's the sample configuration file that uses the given sample details:

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
    ```

    - Two NICs in the same subnet:

        ```yaml
        network:
            ethernets:
                eth0:
                    dhcp4: true
                    dhcp4-overrides:
                        route-metric: 100
                    dhcp6: false
                    match:
                        driver: hv_netvsc

                    set-name: eth0
                    routes:
                     - to: 10.0.1.0/24
                       via: 10.0.1.1
                       metric: 200
                       table: 200
                     - to: 0.0.0.0/0

                       table: 200
                eth1:
                    dhcp4: true
                    dhcp4-overrides:
                        route-metric: 200
                    dhcp6: false
                    match:
                        driver: hv_netvsc
                        macaddress: 00:0d:3a:9a:25:5f
                    set-name: eth1
                    routes:
                     - to: 10.0.1.0/24
                       via: 10.0.1.1
                       metric: 200
                       table: 201
                     - to: 0.0.0.0/0
                       via: 10.0.1.1

                       table: 201
                     - to: 10.0.1.5/32
                       table: 201
              version: 2
        ```

    - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

        ```yaml
        network:

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you use any of the previous configuration file samples, make sure the MAC address value is replaced accordingly. You can get the corresponding NIC MAC address from the output of the `ip a | grep ether | awk '{print $2}'` command.

4. Apply the changes by running the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo netplan apply
    ```

5. To test the connectivity, ping or SSH both IPs from another VM in the same VNET:

    ```bash
    ping 10.0.1.4
    ping 10.0.1.5
    ```

## [SLES 12._x_/15._x_](#tab/sles)

1. Add two routing tables to the */etc/iproute2/rt_tables* file by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo echo "200 eth0-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    sudo echo "201 eth1-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    ```

    If more network interfaces are attached to the VM, add extra routing tables (for example, *202 eth2-rt*, *203 eth3-rt*, and so on).

2. Create the scripts that have the routes and rules for each network interface in the */etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/* directory by using any text editor (in the following commands, the vi text editor is used).

    - */etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth0*

        ```bash
        sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth0
        ```

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        
        /sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
        ```

    - */etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth1*

        ```bash
        sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth1
        ```

        Two NICs in the same subnet:

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        /sbin/ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
        ```

        Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        /sbin/ip route add 10.0.2.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.2.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
        /sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
        ```

    Adjust the network and IP address information accordingly, and preserve the 32-bit value. If there are more than two NICs, make sure that the corresponding IP rules and IP routes are included for each one.
  
3. Provide execution permissions for both scripts by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth0
    sudo chmod +x /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth1
    ```

4. Modify the network configuration files for both *eth0* and *eth1* (*/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth#*) by using any text editor, and include the following line in both files to point to the corresponding script:

    - In the network configuration file */etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0*:

        ```output
        POST_UP_SCRIPT='compat:suse:/etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth0'
        ```

    - In the network configuration file */etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1*:

        ```output
        POST_UP_SCRIPT='compat:suse:/etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth1'
        ```

    Here's a sample of both configuration files:
  
    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0
    ```

    ```output
    BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
    DHCLIENT6_MODE='managed'
    MTU=''
    REMOTE_IPADDR=''
    STARTMODE='onboot'
    CLOUD_NETCONFIG_MANAGE='yes'
    POST_UP_SCRIPT='compat:suse:/etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth0'
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1
    ```

    ```output
    STARTMODE='hotplug'
    BOOTPROTO='dhcp'
    DHCLIENT_SET_DEFAULT_ROUTE='yes'
    DHCLIENT_ROUTE_PRIORITY='10100'
    CLOUD_NETCONFIG_MANAGE='yes'
    POST_DOWN_SCRIPT='compat:suse:cloud-netconfig-cleanup'
    POST_UP_SCRIPT='compat:suse:/etc/sysconfig/network/scripts/ifup-route.eth1'
    ```

    If the */etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1* file doesn't exist, create it by using the content from the */etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0* file. Make sure the `POST_UP_SCRIPT` is adjusted to use the corresponding script. To do this, execute the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0 > /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth1
    ```

5. To apply the changes, restart the network service:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart network
    ```

    The routing rules are now correctly set, and connectivity should work from any network interface. You can test the connectivity by using Secure Shell (SSH) or pinging both IPs from a VM in the same VNET.

6. Verify that the current routes and rules are loaded by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo ip route show
    sudo ip rule show
    ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you still don't have connectivity to the second NIC, restart the VM by using the `sudo reboot` command, repeat step 6, and test the connectivity again.

## [Debian 10/11](#tab/debian)

1. Add two routing tables to the */etc/iproute2/rt_tables* file by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo echo "200 eth0-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    sudo echo "201 eth1-rt" >> /etc/iproute2/rt_tables
    ```

    If more network interfaces are attached to the VM, add extra routing tables (for example, *202 eth2-rt*, *203 eth3-rt*, and so on).

2. Create or modify the configuration file */etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init* with any text editor.

    ```bash
    sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces.d/50-cloud-init
    ```

    Use the following configuration:

    - Two NICs in the same subnet:

        ```output
        auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback

        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        metric 100
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt

        auto eth1
        iface eth1 inet dhcp
        metric 200
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add 10.0.1.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.1.5/32 table eth1-rt
        ```

    - Two NICs in different subnets but in the same VNET:

        ```output
        auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback

        auto eth0
        iface eth0 inet dhcp
        metric 100
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.1.1 dev eth0 table eth0-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.1.4/32 table eth0-rt

        auto eth1
        iface eth1 inet dhcp
        metric 200
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add 10.0.2.0/24 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip route add default via 10.0.2.1 dev eth1 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add from 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
        up /usr/sbin/ip rule add to 10.0.2.5/32 table eth1-rt
        ```

    Adjust the network and IP address information accordingly, and preserve the 32-bit value. If there are more than two NICs, make sure that the corresponding IP rules and IP routes are included for each one.

3. Activate the new configuration by using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart networking
    ```

    The routing rules are now correctly set, and connectivity should work from any network interface. You can test the connectivity by using Secure Shell (SSH) or pinging both IPs from a VM in the same VNET.

4. Verify that the current routes and rules are loaded by using the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo ip route show
    sudo ip rule show
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you still don't have connectivity to the second NIC, restart the VM by using the `sudo reboot` command, repeat step 4, and test the connectivity again.
