## Symptoms

A typical provisioning failure scenario occurs after you create a custom image, then deploy a VM from it, you then experience unto 40mins where the VM status is showing `creating`, and you see this error message:

```output
Provisioning state Provisioning failed. 
OS Provisioning for VM 'sentilo' did not finish in the allotted time. 
The VM may still finish provisioning successfully. Please check provisioning state later. 
Also, make sure the image has been properly prepared (generalized). * Instructions for Windows: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-upload-image/ * Instructions for Linux: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-capture-image/.
```

Or:

```toutputext
Deployment failed. Correlation ID: f9dcb33a-4e6e-45c5-9c9d-b29dd73da2e0. {
  "status": "Failed",
  "error": {
    "code": "ResourceDeploymentFailure",
    "message": "The resource operation completed with terminal provisioning state 'Failed'.",
    "details": [
      {
        "code": "OSProvisioningInternalError",
        "message": "OS Provisioning failed for VM 'iWishThisWouldCreateVM01' due to an internal error: The VM encountered an error during deployment. Please visit https://aka.ms/linuxprovisioningerror for more information on remediation."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You then see the VM state marked as `failed`.

## Why do provisioning failures occur?

Commonly, provisioning failures can happen for multiple reasons, such as:

- Missing provisioning /incorrectly configured agent

  You will need to ensure an agent is present and is working correctly, you should be using [cloud-init](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/using-cloud-init) or if your image will not support this, you can review these [steps](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/no-agent).

- Incorrect image configuration

   We have guidance on how images should be set up with cloud-init and other [Azure image requirements](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-generic), please check this.

## Troubleshoot provisioning failures

To identify the reason for failed provisioning you will need to start with the serial log, this is available to you by deploying the VM with Azure Boot diagnostics.

You will need to deploy a new VM with [boot diagnostics enabled](/cli/azure/vm/boot-diagnostics) for the VM with the failing image to access provisioning events in the serial log.

```azurecli
# create resource group
resourceGroup=myBrokenImageRG
location=westus2
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location $location
# create storage account
storageacct=mydiagdata$RANDOM
az storage account create \
  --resource-group $resourceGroup \
  --name $storageacct \
  --sku Standard_LRS \
  --location $location
# create VM
vmName=iWishThisWouldCreateVM01
brokenImageName=<ResourceID of brokenImage>
sshPubkeyPath=""
az vm create \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --name $vmName \
    --image $brokenImageName \
    --admin-username azadmin \
    --ssh-key-value $sshPubkeyPath \
    --boot-diagnostics-storage $storageacct
```

To view the serial log, you can go to the Portal, or run the command below to download the *serialConsoleLogBlobUri* log:

```azurecli
az vm boot-diagnostics get-boot-log-uris --name $vmName --resource-group $resourceGroup
```

## Understanding the serial log for system events and provisioning events

When the VM is created for the first time, cloud-init will start up and try to mount an ISO, establish network connectivity, set the properties passed during the VM creation, mount the ephemeral disk (on supported VM sizes), and signal back to the Azure platform that the initial OS config has completed.

## Common errors

### Disabled UDF module

**Error** In the serial log:

```output
[   10.855501] cloud-init[732]: Cloud-init v. 20.4.1-0ubuntu1~18.04.1 running 'init-local' at Thu, 28 Jan 2021 23:43:02 +0000. Up 10.68 seconds.

```

**Error** in *waagent.log*:

```output
"UDF driver Blocklisted 2020/09/11 19:16:40.240016 ERROR Daemon Provisioning failed: [ProtocolError] [CopyOvfEnv] Error mounting dvd: [OSUtilError] Failed to mount dvd deviceInner error: [mount -o ro -t udf,iso9660 /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom/secure] returned 32: mount: /mnt/cdrom/secure: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error."
```

**Cause**: The UDF driver is not loaded in the kernel, this is required for the VM to provision, see [image requirements](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-generic).

When a VM is first provisioned on Azure, the Azure host presents a 'provisioning cdrom iso disk' to the VM. This provisioning disk is usually presented to the VM through /dev/sr0. Within the provisioning disk, there is a provisioning manifest which contains a VM's provisioning information. The in-VM provisioning agent is expected to mount the provisioning disk, read the provisioning manifest, and provision the VM accordingly.

Since the provisioning disk is a `cdrom iso disk`, the Linux UDF driver is required by the kernel in order to successfully mount this disk. This is referenced in Microsoft [documentation on Linux images](/azure/virtual-machines/linux/create-upload-generic). For this VM, logs indicate that the provisioning disk failed to mount, which caused VM provisioning to fail. The most likely reason is due to missing or blocked UDF drivers.

**Solution**: Ensure the UDF driver is configured to be loaded in the kernel.

A common way for UDF drivers to be blocked is through configs within `/etc/modprobe.d/`. Please work with the customer/image owner to ensure that Linux UDF drivers are present and not blocked. Please consult [this article on blocking/unblocking kernel drivers](https://linux.die.net/man/5/modprobe.d).

### Unicode characters in VM tags issue

**Error** in *cloud-init.log*:

```output
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceAzure.py", line 1316, in _get_metadata_from_imds
    except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError:
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'JSONDecodeError'
```

**Cause**: This happens because VM tags have non-ascii characters and the version of cloud-init is older than 20.3.

**Solution**: Either use or ensure your image supports cloud-init 20.3 or newer, or remove non-ascii characters from the VM tags.

### Password with unicode characters

**Error** in *cloud-init.log*:

```output
File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cloudinit/sources/DataSourceAzure.py", line 1153, in encrypt_pass
    return crypt.crypt(password, salt_id + util.rand_str(strlen=16))
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/crypt.py", line 55, in crypt
    return _crypt.crypt(word, salt)
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode characters in position 10-11: ordinal not in range(128)
```

**Cause**: This happens because the provided password has unsupported characters (non-ascii).

**Solution**: Provide a password that only has ascii characters.

### Dhclient permission

**Error** in cloud-init.log:

```output
Command: ['/var/tmp/cloud-init/cloud-init-dhcp-yd8mvxud/dhclient', '-1', '-v', '-lf', '/var/tmp/cloud-init/cloud-init-dhcp-yd8mvxud/dhcp.leases', '-pf', '/var/tmp/cloud-init/cloud-init-dhcp-yd8mvxud/dhclient.pid', 'eth0', '-sf', '/bin/true']
Exit code: -
Reason: [Errno 13] Permission denied: b'/var/tmp/cloud-init/cloud-init-dhcp-yd8mvxud/dhclient'
```

**Cause**: Older versions of cloud-init (before version 20.3) perform DHCP by copying and executing `dhclient` within `/var/tmp`. If `/var/tmp` is mounted as `noexec` (no execution) by the VM, then DHCP will fail due to `dhclient` not having permissions to execute within `/var/tmp`.

Cloud-init versions >= 20.3 contain a fix which falls back and executes `dhclient` "as-is" (by not copying and executing it in `/var/tmp` if there are permissions issues).

**Solution**: For VMs running cloud-init older than version 20.3, configure the VM so that `/var/tmp` is not mounted as `noexec`. Alternatively, upgrade the VM's cloud-init package to a version >= 20.3.

> [!NOTE]
> The `dhclient` permission issue has been resolved in cloud-init 22.4 and later versions. For more information, see [cloud-init issues 3956](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/issues/3956).

## Getting more logs

If you find that you need more logs from the VM to understand the issues, you maybe can SSH into the VM using the [serial console](/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/serial-console-linux) using a user that is baked into the image. If you do not have a user baked in, then you can either recreate the image with a user, or use the [AZ VM Repair tool](/cli/azure/vm/repair#az-vm-repair-create) which will mount the OS disk of the VM that failed to provision, to another VM.

```azurecli
az vm repair create  \
    --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --name $vmName \
    --repair-username repairadm \
    --repair-password AnotherPassword123! \
    --repair-vm-name repairVM \
    --verbose
```
