# Troubleshoot CPU performance issues in Linux

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article explains how to troubleshoot CPU performance issues on Azure Linux virtual machines (VMs) by using performance monitoring tools. You can use the following tools for this task.

|Resource|Tools|
|---|---|
|CPU|`top`, `vmstat`, `sysstat`, `pidstat`, `htop`, `mpstat`|

## top

The `top` tool is a primary CPU monitoring tool that offers a detailed view of CPU usage. It provides real-time insights into server performance. The following is an example of a `top` report from a VM that has two CPU cores:

```output

```

Key metrics:

- `load average` (located on the right side of the top row): Represents the average number of processes that are running or waiting for CPU time over specific time intervals. In the example output, `load average: 1.72, 0.62, 0.25` represents:

    - 1.72: The average load over the last 1 minute.
    - 0.62: The average load over the last 5 minutes.
    - 0.25: The average load over the last 15 minutes.
- `Tasks total`: Provides an overview of the total number of processes that are currently loaded in the system.
- `running`: Indicates how many processes are actively using CPU time.
- `zombie`: Shows processes that finished running but still have an entry in the process table.
- `us`: Represents as a percentage the amount of CPU that's consumed by user processes.
- `sy`: Represents as a percentage the amount of CPU that's consumed by system processes.
- `id`: Represents as a percentage how idle each CPU is.
- `wa`: Indicates the percentage of CPU time that's spent waiting for I/O operations to finish.

### Analyze the report

This VM contains two CPU cores. Therefore, a load average of 2.0 would mean that both cores are fully used. In the example, the `load average` over the last 1 minute is 1.72. This indicates that the system load is approaching its full capacity. The `15.2 id` value also indicates that the CPU is operating at low capacity (an idle rate of 15.2 percent for CPUs).

> [!TIP]
> - You can quickly determine the CPU count by running the `nproc` command.
> - To display per-CPU usage in the `top` report, press the "1" key.
> - If a process is multithreaded and spans multiple CPUs, the top report will display a total usage that exceeds 100 percent.

Next, check the `dd` process lines in the example output:

```output
PID USER        PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM TIME+COMMAND
17038 root      20   0    8476   2984   1984 D   3.7   0.0   0:00.77 dd
17039 root      20   0    8476   2928   1916 D   3.7   0.0   0:01.14 dd
```

- `%CPU`: Indicates the CPU load percentage for a single core. You may see the value exceed 100 percent. This means that it's occupying a full CPU core plus other CPU cores.

- `S`: Lists the state of the process. Here, `D` state (TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE) is a state that occurs in a kernel code path where the execution can't be interrupted while a task is processed.

An example of `D` state might be a low-level driver as it interacts with hardware. For example:

- Retrieve network packet data from the network card.
- Access a block of data on a hard drive.

## ps

The `ps` command displays running processes and can be sorted by CPU or memory. You can use the following `ps` command to list the top five CPU-consuming processes:

```bash
sudo ps -eo pcpu,pmem,pid,user,args | sort -r -k1 | head -6
```

Example output:

```output
%CPU %MEM     PID USER     COMMAND
33.3  0.0   17039 root     dd if=/dev/zero of=/cases/file1.bin bs=1M count=2048 status=progress
21.0  0.0   17038 root     dd if=/dev/zero of=/cases/file2.bin bs=1M count=2048 status=progress
 0.6  0.3     858 root     /opt/microsoft/auoms/bin/auoms
 0.3  1.7    1057 root     /opt/microsoft/mdatp/sbin/wdavdaemon
 0.3  0.4    2034 root     /usr/libexec/platform-python -u bin/WALinuxAgent-2.11.1.4-py3.9.egg -run-exthandlers
```

### CPU resource metrics

The CPU usage is dependent on which resource is trying to access the CPU. The kernel includes a scheduler that's responsible for scheduling resources. This process assigns priorities to the different resources. The following list describes the priorities from highest to lowest:

- `Hardware Interrupts`: Requests that are created by hardware on the system to process data. Hardware interrupts send requests without waiting for current program to finish. The requests are unconditional and immediate. For example, they could be a keystroke, a mouse movement, or a signal from a network adapter when a packet arrives.

- `Soft Interrupts`: Kernel software interrupts that do maintenance of the kernel. For example, the kernel clock tick thread is a soft interrupt. At a regular interval, it checks to make sure that a process doesn't pass its allotted time on a processor.

- `Real Time Threads`: Real time processes might run on the CPU and preempt the kernel.

- `Kernel Threads`: A kernel thread is a kernel entity, such as processes and interrupt handlers. It's the entity that's handled by the system scheduler. The operating system handles kernel-level threads directly.

- `User Threads`: This space is often referred to as "user land." All software applications run in the user space. This space has the lowest priority in the kernel scheduling mechanism.

To understand how the kernel manages these different resources, we have to first understand some key concepts such as context switches, run queues, and usage.

## sar

The `sar` tool is provided by the **sysstat** package that provides other statistical reporting tools, such as `iostat`. By default, the `sysstat` package isn't installed. 

To configure and enable `sar` to start on system startup, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sysstat
sudo systemctl start sysstat
```

### How to use sar

The `sar` provides value in various ways, both directly and indirectly:

- It's an overall barometer of system performance. When you work on a system without having a clear understanding of its "normal" state, it's useful to check the `sar` data from the past few days to establish a baseline of standard activity.
- It offers insights into CPU load, load average, memory usage, and so on.
- It detects activity that might cause the system to stop responding (crash or hang). This lets you monitor system statistics prior to a critical event.
- By default, it records statistics every 10 minutes.

**Basic usage**

Display detailed CPU usage statistics for all processors on the VM:

```bash
sudo sar -t -P ALL
```

Display CPU usage statistics from the log file `sa10`:

```bash
sar -t -u -f /var/log/sa/sa10
```

For more information, see [Use sar to monitor resources in Linux](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/276533)

## vmstat

The `vmstat` tool provides a high-level overview of CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage in a single pane.

Typically, you run vmstat by using the following numerical parameters:

```bash
vmstat [delay] [count]
```

- `delay`: Specifies the refresh interval in seconds

- `count`: Defines how many times the output refreshes.

If you provide only one of these parameters, itâ€™s treated as the refresh interval, and the output will refresh on an infinite loop.

### Example output during high I/O activity while command dd is running

In the following example, the first line of the report, `2 3 0 33639696 ...`, contains the average values since the last time that the computer was restarted. All other lines in the report represent their respective current values. 

```bash
vmstat 2 5
```

```output

```

**Procs**

- r: The number of processes that are waiting for runtime
- b: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep

**System**

- in: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock
- cs: The number of context switches per second

**CPU**

These are percentages of total CPU time:

- us: Time spent running nonkernel code (user time, including CPU low-priority processing time)
- sy: Time spent running kernel code (system time)
- id: Time spent idle
- wa: Time spent waiting for I/O
- st: Time stolen from a VM

### How to identify which process is causing high context switches

To identify which process is causing high I/O activity, you can use the `pidstat` command. This command monitors individual tasks that the Linux kernel manages.

To check which process is causing the issue, run the following command. Similar to the `vmstat` option usage, this command runs **five** times at a **2-second** interval.

```bash
sudo pidstat -wt 2 5
```

- `-w`: Report task switching activity
- `-t`: Display statistics for threads that are associated with selected tasks

The following `vmstat` report and `pidstat` report are generated when you run the `stress-ng --cpu 2 --switch 50 --timeout 60s` command. This command purposely generates high CPU context switches.

## Frequently asked questions

### How can I identify the root cause of a high-CPU issue that has occurred recently or intermittently? Which logs should I check?

In order to identify the root cause of a high-CPU issue, a performance monitor tool such as `sysstat` must be enabled and running while the issue occurs. We need the `sar` logs (included in the `SOSREPORT` log bundle) from the time that the issue occurred.

Without the `sar` logs, we can't establish a baseline for comparison when a performance issue occurs. This makes it challenging to determine how much performance has downgraded during peak usage periods.

If you are using third-party monitoring tools, provide details about these tools when you contact Microsoft Support. It's essential for support agents to understand the details, such as the definitions of metrics, when they compare that information to the data that's retrieved from native Linux command-line tools.

### The VM is currently experiencing high CPU usage. How can I identify the root cause?

You can use tools such as `top` and `ps` to identify the issue, as explained earlier.

### I've identified the high CPU process. Is it possible to debug it?

To retrieve the list of threads, you can use the following script. It shows the stack of each thread of top three high CPU processes:
    
```bash
for H_PID in $(ps -eo pcpu,pid,ppid,user,args | sort -k1 -r | grep -v PID | head -3 | awk '{print $2}'); do ps -Llp $H_PID; sudo cat /proc/$H_PID/stack; echo; done
```

### A high CPU issue occurs intermittently and persists briefly every few minutes. We have the `sosreport` that has `sysstat` enabled. How can I check the sar log to identify the root cause?

The default `sar` collection interval is 10 minutes. If the issue is occurring in too short an interval or too briefly, `sar` might not reveal the problem because the metric result is aggregated.
If the default 10-minute interval isn't providing the necessary resolution, you can adjust the `sar` time interval to make it more suitable for diagnosing the problem.
