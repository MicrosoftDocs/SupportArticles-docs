# Troubleshoot startup issues for Pacemaker Cluster services and resources

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs

This article discusses the most common causes of startup issues in RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Pacemaker Cluster resources or services, and also provides guidance to identify and resolve the issues.

## Scenario 1: Can't start cluster service because of quorum

### Symptom for scenario 1

- Cluster node doesn't join a cluster after a cluster restart.
- Nodes are reported as `UNCLEAN (offline)`.
- Current DC is reported as `NONE`.

  ```bash
  sudo pcs status
  ```
  ```output
  Cluster name: my_cluster
  Status of pacemakerd: 'Pacemaker is running' (last updated 2024-06-25 16:34:49 -04:00)
  Cluster Summary:
  * Stack: corosync
  * **Current DC: NONE**
  * Last updated: Tue Jun 25 14:34:49 2024
  * Last change:  Tue Jun 25 14:29:51 2024 by root via cibadmin on node-0
  * 2 nodes configured
  * 9 resource instances configured

  Node List:
  * **Node node-0: UNCLEAN (offline)**
  * **Node node-1: UNCLEAN (offline)**
  ```

- `sudo pcs quorum status` returns the following error message:

  ```bash
  sudo pcs quorum status
  ```
  ```output
  Error: Unable to get quorum status: Unable to start votequorum status tracking: CS_ERR_BAD_HANDLE
  Check for the error: Corosync quorum is not configured in /var/log/messeges:
  Jun 16 11:17:53 node-0 pacemaker-controld[509433]: error: Corosync quorum is not configured
  ```

### Cause for scenario 1

The **VoteQuorum** service is a component of the corosync project. To prevent split-brain scenarios, this service can be optionally loaded into a corosync cluster's nodes. Every system in the cluster is given a certain number of votes to achieve this quorum. This makes sure that cluster actions can occur only if most votes are cast. Either every node or no node must have the service loaded. The outcomes are uncertain if the service is loaded into a subset of cluster nodes.

The following `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf` setting enables **VoteQuorum** service within corosync:

```output
quorum {
    provider: corosync_votequorum
}
```

**VoteQuorum** reads its configuration from `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf`. Some values can be changed at runtime and others are read only at corosync startup. It's important that those values are consistent across all nodes that are participating in the cluster. Otherwise, vote quorum behavior is unpredictable.

### Resolution for scenario 1

1. Before you make any changes, ensure you have a backup or snapshot. For more information, see [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction).

2. Check for missing quorum section in `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf`. Compare the existing `corosync.conf` with any backup that's available in `/etc/corosync/`.
   
3. Put the cluster into maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ```

4. Update the changes in `/etc/corosync/corosync.conf`.

    Example of a two-node cluster:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
    ```
    ```output
    totem {
    version: 2
    cluster_name: my_cluster
    transport: knet
    token: 30000
    crypto_cipher: aes256
    crypto_hash: sha256
    cluster_uuid: afd62fe2045b43b9a102de76fdf4659a
    }
    nodelist {
    node {
        ring0_addr: node-0
        name: node-0
        nodeid: 1
    }

    node {
        ring0_addr: node-1
        name: node-1
        nodeid: 2
    }
    }

    **quorum {
    provider: corosync_votequorum
    two_node: 1
    }**

    logging {
    to_logfile: yes
    logfile: /var/log/cluster/corosync.log
    to_syslog: yes
    timestamp: on
    }
    ```

5. Remove the cluster from maintenance-mode.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```

6. Sync the cluster:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs cluster sync
    ```

7. Reload corosync:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs cluster reload corosync
    ```

## Scenario 2: Issue in cluster VIP resource

### Symptom for scenario 2

A virtual IP resource (`IPaddr2` resource) didn't start or stop in Pacemaker.

The following error messages are logged in `/var/log/pacemaker.log`:

```output
25167 IPaddr2(VIP)[16985]:    2024/09/07_15:44:19 ERROR: Unable to find nic or netmask.
25168 IPaddr2(VIP)[16985]:    2024/09/07_15:44:19 ERROR: [findif] failed
```

The error can also be observed while running `sudo pcs status`:

```bash
sudo pcs status
```
```output
vip_HN1_03_start_0 on node-1 'unknown error' (1): call=30, status=complete, exit-reason='[findif] failed', last-rc-change='Thu Jan 07 17:25:52 2025', queued=0ms, exec=57ms
```

### Cause for scenario 2

1. To choose which network adapter (NIC) to start the `IPAddr2` resource on, `IPaddr2` invokes the `findif()` function, as defined in `/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/IPaddr2` that is contained in the `resource-agents` package.

2. The correct network adapter is determined by the options that are set on the `IPAddr2` resource, such as `ip` (required), `cidr_netmask`, and `broadcast`.

    For example:

    Check the `IPaddr2` settings:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource show vip_HN1_03
    ```
    ```output
    Resource: vip_HN1_03 (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=IPaddr2)
    Attributes: ip=172.17.10.10 cidr_netmask=24 nic=ens6
    Operations: start interval=0s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-start-timeout-20s)
                stop interval=0s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-stop-timeout-20s)
                monitor interval=10s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-monitor-interval-10s)
    ```

3. Try to determine the `NIC` information manually. In this example, based on the IP address and netmask, we can successfully find `ens6` from the route table:

    ```bash
    sudo ip -o -f inet route list match 172.17.10.10/24 scope link
    ```
    ```output
    172.17.10.0/24 dev ens6 proto kernel src 172.17.10.7 
    ```

4. In a situation in which `NIC (ens6)` is down, you can't manually find the `NIC` information, and that might cause `[findif]` to fail. Replace `172.17.10.10/24` and `ens6` as appropriate.

    ```bash
    sudo ip link set ens6 down
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo ip -o -f inet route list match 172.17.10.10/24 scope link 
    ```

### Resolution for scenario 2

If a route that matches the `VIP` isn't in the default routing table, you can specify the `NIC` name in the Pacemaker resource so that it can be configured to bypass the check:

1. Before you make any changes, ensure you have a backup or snapshot. For more information, see [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction).

2. Put the cluster into maintenance mode:
   
    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ```

3. Update the `NIC` resources:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource update vip_HN1_03 nic=ens6
    ```

4. Restart the `NIC `resources:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource restart vip_HN1_03
    ```
    ```output
    vip_HN1_03 successfully restarted
    ```

5. Remove the cluster from `maintenance-mode`:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```

6. Verify the `IP` resource:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource show vip_HN1_03
    ```
    ```output
    Warning: This command is deprecated and will be removed. Please use 'pcs resource config' instead.
    Resource: vip_HN1_03 (class=ocf provider=heartbeat type=IPaddr2)
      Attributes: cidr_netmask=32 ip=172.17.223.36 nic=vlan10
      Meta Attrs: resource-stickiness=INFINITY
      Operations: monitor interval=10s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-monitor-interval-10s)
                  start interval=0s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-start-interval-0s)
                  stop interval=0s timeout=20s (vip_HN1_03-stop-interval-0s)
    ```

For more information about this scenario, see the following Red Hat article: ["ERROR: [findif] failed" shown in Pacemaker'](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2119711).

## Scenario 3: Issue in SAP HANA (High-performance Analytic Appliance)

### Scenario 3, Symptom 1: SAP HANA DB doesn't start and generates an unknown error

SAP HANA DB doesn't start, and it returns an `unknown error` error message.

1. In the `/var/log/messages` log section, an `SRHOOK=SFAIL` entry is logged. This indicates that the cluster nodes are out of sync.
2. The secondary cluster node is in `WAITING4PRIM` status.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs status --full
    ```
    ```output
    * Node node-0 (1):
        + hana_XXX_clone_state              : PROMOTED  
        + hana_XXX_sync_state               : PRIM      
        + hana_XXX_roles                    : 2:P:master1:master:worker:slave

    * Node node-1 (2):
        + hana_XXX_clone_state              : WAITING4PRIM  
        + hana_XX_sync_state                : SFAIL      
        + hana_XXX_roles                    : 2:S:master1:master:worker:slave
    ```

3. When you run `sudo pcs status`, the cluster status is shown as follows:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs status
    ```
    ```output
    2 nodes configured
    8 resources configured

    Online: [ node-0 node-1 ]

    Full list of resources:

      rsc_st_azure	(stonith:fence_azure_arm):	Started node-1
      Clone Set: cln_SAPHanaTopology [rsc_SAPHanaTopology]
          Started: [ node-0 node-1 ]
      Master/Slave Set: msl_SAPHana [rsc_SAPHana]
          Master: [ node-1 ]
          Slave:  [ node-0 ]
      Resource Group: g_ip_HN1_HBD00
          vip_HN1_HBD00	(ocf::heartbeat:IPaddr2):	Started node-0 
          nc_HN1_HBD00	(ocf::heartbeat:azure-lb):	Started node-0 

            
    Failed Resource Actions:
    * rsc_SAPHana_monitor_61000 on node-0 'unknown error' (1): call=32, status=complete, exitreason='',
        last-rc-change='Sat May 22 09:29:20 2021', queued=0ms, exec=0ms
    * rsc_SAPHana_start_0 on node-1 'not running' (7): call=55, status=complete, exitreason='',
        last-rc-change='Sat May 22 09:36:32 2021', queued=0ms, exec=3093ms
    ```

### Cause for scenario 3, symptom 1

Pacemaker can't start the SAP HANA resource if there are `SYN` failures between the primary and secondary nodes:

```bash
sudo SAPHanaSR-showAttr
```
```output
Global cib-time                 maintenance

```

### Workaround for scenario 3, symptom 1

The SAP HANA resource can't be started by Pacemaker if there are `SYN` failures between the primary and secondary cluster nodes. To mitigate this issue, you must manually enable `SYN` between the primary and secondary nodes.

> [!Important]
> Steps 2, 3, and 4 must be performed by using a SAP administrator account. This is because these steps use a SAP System ID to stop, start, and re-enable replication manually.

1. Before you make any changes, ensure you have a backup or snapshot. For more information, see [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction).

2. Put the cluster into maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ```
    
3. Check the SAP HANA DB and processes state: 

   a. Verify that both the primary and secondary nodes are running the SAP database and related SAP processes. One should function as the primary node and the other as the secondary. This makes sure that the databases on both nodes remain synchronized.

   b. Run `HDB info` on each node to check the SAP-related processes that are running in the node. The SAP administrator should be able to confirm that the required process are running on both of the nodes.
      
      ```bash
      HDB info
      ```
      ```output

      ```
    
   c. If the SAP DB and services aren't active on the node, we recommend that you contact your SAP administrator to review and stop the SAP DB services, first in the secondary node and then in the primary node:

      ```bash
      sudo HDB stop
      ```
      or:

      ```bash
      sudo sapcontrol -nr <SAPInstanceNo> -function stop
      ```
    
   d. After the stop operation finishes, start HANA DB in the primary node and then in the secondary node. Modify `<SAPInstanceNo>` as appropriate.

      ```bash
      sudo HDB start
      ```
      or:
    
      ```bash
      sudo sapcontrol -nr <SAPInstanceNo> -function start
      ```
4. If the database nodes are still not synchronized, the SAP administrator should troubleshoot the issue by reviewing the SAP logs to make sure that the database nodes are correctly synchronized.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The SAP administrator must determine which node should be designated as the primary and which as the secondary to make sure that no database data is lost in the process.

5. After you enable replication, check the system replication status by using the SAP system administrator account. In this situation, the user admin account is `hn1adm`.

   On the primary node, verify that the overall system replication status is `ACTIVE`.

   If the database nodes are still not synchronized, the SAP administrator should troubleshoot the issue by reviewing the SAP logs to make sure that the database nodes are correctly synchronized:

   ```bash
   sudo su - hn1adm -c "python /usr/sap/HN1/HDB03/exe/python_support/systemReplicationStatus.py"
   ```
   ```output
   | Host   | Port  | Service Name | Volume ID | Site ID | Site Name | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary | Secondary     | Replication | Replication | Replication    |
   |        |       |              |           |         |           | Host      | Port      | Site ID   | Site Name | Active Status | Mode        | Status      | Status Details |

   ```

6. Verify the SAP HANA system replication status again by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo SAPHanaSR-showAttr
   ```
   ```output

   ```

7. Exit the SAP Admin account, and then remove the cluster from maintenance mode:

   ```bash
   sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
   ```

8. Make sure that the Pacemaker cluster resources are running successfully.

### Scenario 3, Symptom 2: SAP HANA doesn't start because of replication failure

The SAP HANA resource experiences startup failures, and its `hana_xxx_roles` attribute shows `1:N:master1::worker:`. The `N` status indicates that the resource is out of sync and running in standalone mode. The database resource is neither primary nor secondary on any node.

When you run the `sudo pcs status --full` command, the `node attributes` status is shown as follows:

  ```bash
  sudo pcs status --full
  ```
  ```output
  Node Attributes:
    * Node: node-0 (1):
      * hana_XXX_clone_state            : UNDEFINED
      * hana_XXX_op_mode			          : logreplay
      * hana_XXX_remoteHost             : node-1
      * hana_XXX_roles                  : 1:N:master1::worker:

### Cause for scenario 3, symptom 2

This issue frequently occurs if the database is modified (manually stopped or started, replication is paused, and so on) while the cluster is in maintenance mode.

### Resolution for scenario 3, symptom 2

> [!Note]
> Steps 1 through 5 should be performed by an SAP administrator.

1. Before you make any changes, ensure you have a backup or snapshot. For more information, see [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction).
  
2. Put the cluster into maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ```

3. Manually start the database outside the cluster on the primary node:

    ```bash
    sudo HDB start
    ```

4. Start replication on the primary node. Replace `<site id>` as appropriate.

    ```bash
    sudo hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name=<site id>
    ```

5. Initialize replication on secondary node. Replace `<primary node>`, `<Instance ##>` and `<side id>` as appropriate.

    ```bash
    sudo hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost=<primary node> --remoteInstance=<Instance ##> --replicationMode=syncmem --name=<site id>
    ```

6. Manually start the database outside the cluster on the secondary node: 
 
    ```bash
    sudo HDB start
    ```

7. Verify that replications are running as expected. To do this, run the following command on both nodes: 
  
    ```bash
    sudo hdbnsutil -sr_state
    ```

8. Remove the cluster from maintenance mode.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```

9. Clear the fail count of the SAP HANA resource. Replace `<SAPHana resource name>` with your SAP Pacemaker cluster setup.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource cleanup <SAPHana resource name>
    ```

For more information about this scenario, see the following Red Hat article: [SAPHana Resource Experiencing Start Failures with hana_xxx_roles Reporting N (Standalone)'](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7062225).

### Scenario 3, Symptom 3: SAP HANA resource doesn't start because of hdbdaemon issues

SAP HANA Resource Start Failure with error message as shown:

```output
'FAIL: process hdbdaemon HDB Daemon not running'
```

The `sudo pcs status --full` command can also be used to view this error, as it also resulted the SAP HANA Pacemaker cluster resources failover error.

```output
Failed Resource Actions:
  * SAPHana_XXX_00_start_0 on node-0 'error' (1): call=44, status='complete', exitreason='', last-rc-change='2024-07-07 06:15:45 -08:00', queued=0ms, exec=51659ms
```

### Cause for scenario 3, symptom 3

A review of the `/var/log/messages` log indicates that `hbddaemon` didn't start because of the following error:

```output

```

### Resolution for scenario 3, symptom 3

See the following Red Hat article: [SAPHana Resource Start Failure with Error 'FAIL: process hdbdaemon HDB Daemon not running'](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7058526).

## Scenario 4: Issue that affects the ASCS and ERS resources

### Symptom for scenario 4

ASCS and ERS instances can't start under cluster control. The `/var/log/messages` log indicates The following errors:

```output
Jun  9 23:29:16 nodeci SAPRh2_10[340480]: Unable to change to Directory /usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/work. (Error 2 No such file or directory) [ntservsserver.cpp 3845]
Jun  9 23:29:16 nodeci SAPRH2_00[340486]: Unable to change to Directory /usr/sap/Rh2/ASCS00/work. (Error 2 No such file or directory) [ntservsserver.cpp 3845]
```

### Cause for scenario 4

Because of incorrect `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` attributes, the SAP instances such as ASCS and ERS, didn't start under cluster control. 

### Resolution for scenario 4

> [!Note]
> This resolution is applicable if `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` are separate files.

1. Before you make any changes, ensure you have a backup or snapshot. For more information, see [Azure VM backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-vms-introduction).
  
2. Put the cluster into maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=true
    ```

3. Verify the `pf(profile)` path from the `/usr/sap/sapservices` file:

    ```bash
    sudo cat /usr/sap/sapservices
    ```
    ```output
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/RH2/ASCS00/exe:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH;/usr/sap/RH2/ASCS00/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/RH2/SYS/profile/START_ASCS00_nodeci -D -u rh2adm
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/exe:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH;/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/profile/START_ERS10_nodersvi -D -u rh2adm
    ```

4. Correct the `InstanceName` and `START_PROFILE` attribute values in the `SAPInstance` cluster configuration resource agent. 

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource update ASCS_RH2_ASCS00 InstanceName=RH2_ASCS00_nodeci START_PROFILE=/usr/sap/RH2/SYS/profile/START_ASCS00_nodeci
    ```
    
    Replace `RH2_ASCS00_nodeci` and `/usr/sap/RH2/SYS/profile/START_ASCS00_nodeci` with the appropriate values.

    ```bash
    sudo pcs resource update ERS_RH2_ERS10 InstanceName=RH2_ERS10_nodersvi START_PROFILE=/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/profile/START_ERS10_nodersvi
    ```
    Replace `RH2_ERS10_nodersvi` and `/usr/sap/RH2/ERS10/profile/START_ERS10_nodersvi` with the appropriate values.

5.  Remove the cluster from maintenance mode:

    ```bash
    sudo pcs property set maintenance-mode=false
    ```
