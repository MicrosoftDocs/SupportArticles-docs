# Troubleshoot Windows VM OS with missing boot manager

This article explains when the Windows VM boot manager is missing, and how to solve the problem.

## Symptom

When you pull the screenshot of the VM, the OS boot process is stopped with the error:

`BOOTMGR is missing`

`Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart`

:::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/bootmgr-missing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Boot Manager is missing message.":::

## Cause

There are several reasons this error could occur:

- The operating system (OS) boot process could not locate an active system partition.
- There's a missing reference on the BCD store to locate the windows partition.
- There has been a Ransomware attack.

## Solution

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM, you may try [restoring the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot problem.

### Process overview

1. Create and access a Repair VM.
1. Verify that the OS partition is active.
1. Fix the missing reference in the BCD store
1. Verify if a ransomware attack has occurred.
1. Rebuild the VM.

> [!NOTE]
> When encountering this error, the Guest OS is not operational. Troubleshoot this issue in offline mode to resolve this issue.

### Create and access a repair VM

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM, you may try [restoring the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot problem.

1. Use steps 1-3 of the [VM Repair Commands](/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/repair-windows-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands) to prepare a Repair VM.
1. Using Remote Desktop Connection, connect to the Repair VM.

### Verify that the OS partition is active

> [!NOTE]
> This mitigation applies only for Generation 1 VMs. Generation 2 VMs (using UEFI) does not use an active partition

Verify the OS partition which holds the BCD store for the disk is marked as active.

   1. Open an elevated command prompt and open the DISKPART tool.

      `diskpart`

   2. List the disks on the system and look for added disks and proceed to select the new disk. In this example, the new disk is Disk 1.

      ```ps
      list disk
      sel disk 1
      ```

      :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/list-disk.png" alt-text="The diskpart window shows outputs of list disk and sel disk 1 commands. Disk 0 and Disk 1 are displayed in the table. Disk 1 is the selected disk.":::

   3. List all the partitions on that disk and then proceed to select the partition you want to check. Usually System Managed partitions are smaller and around 350 Mb in size. In the image below, this partition is Partition 1.

      ```ps
      list partition
      sel partition 1
      ```

      :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/list-partition.png" alt-text="The diskpart window shows outputs of list partition and sel partition 1 commands. Partition 1 is the selected disk.":::

   4. Check the status of the partition. In our example, Partition 1 is not active.

      `detail partition`

      :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/detail-partition-not-active.png" alt-text="The diskpart window with output of the detail partition command where Partition 1 is not active.":::

      If the partition isn't active, now change the Active flag and then recheck the change was done properly.

      ```ps
      active
      detail partition
      ```

      :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/detail-partition-active.png" alt-text="The diskpart window with output of the detail partition command where Partition 1 is active.":::

   5. Now exit the DISKPART tool.

      `exit`

### Fix the missing reference in the BCD store

1. Open up an elevated CMD and run CHKDSK on that disks.

   `chkdsk <DRIVE LETTER>: /f`

2. Gather the current boot setup info and document it, take note of the identifier on the active partition.

   1. For Generation 1 VM:

      `bcdedit /store <drive letter>:\boot\bcd /enum`

      1. If this command errors out due to `\boot\bcd` not being found, then go to the following mitigation.

      2. Write down the identifier of the Windows Boot loader. This identifier is the one with the path `\windows\system32\winload.exe`.

         :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/windows-identifier-generation-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the output of Generation 1 VM, which lists the identifier number under Windows Boot Loader.":::

   2. For Generation 2 VM:

      `bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /enum`

      1. If this command errors out due to `\boot\bcd` not being found, then go to the following mitigation.

      2. Write down the identifier of the Windows Boot loader. This identifier is the one with the path `\windows\system32\winload.efi`.

         :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/windows-identifier-generation-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the output of Generation 2 VM, which lists the identifier number under Windows Boot Loader.":::

3. Run the following commands:

   1. For **Generation 1** VM:

      ```ps
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} device partition=<BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} device partition=<WINDOWS FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} recoveryenabled Off
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} osdevice partition=<WINDOWS FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
      ```

      >[!NOTE]
      In case the VHD has a single partition and both the BCD Folder and Windows Folder are in the same volume, and if the above setup didn't work, then try replacing the partition values with ***boot***.

      ```ps
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} device boot
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} device boot
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} recoveryenabled Off
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} osdevice boot
      bcdedit /store <BCD FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
      ```

   2. For **Generation 2** VM:

      ```ps
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} device partition=<Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {bootmgr} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} device partition=<WINDOWS FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} integrityservices enable
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} recoveryenabled Off
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} osdevice partition=<WINDOWS FOLDER - DRIVE LETTER>:
      bcdedit /store <Volume Letter of EFI System Partition>:EFI\Microsoft\boot\bcd /set {<IDENTIFIER>} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
      ```

### Verify if a ransomware attack has occurred

If the above solutions did not resolve the issue, you may want to verify if a ransomware attack has occurred on your VM.

1. Once the disk is attached, set the Windows Explorer view to show "Hidden items".

2. View the disk and see if there are any .txt files on the root folder with instructions on how to regain access to the files of the VM:

   :::image type="content" source="media/os-bootmgr-missing/txt-file.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows a TXT file on the root folder.":::

3. If you find a `.txt` file with content that is similar to the below example, it means that the machine was the target of a ransomware attack:

   ```output
   Your files are now encrypted!
    
   Your personal ID :
    
   "XXXXXXX"
    
   What happened?
    
   Your important documents, databases, documents, network folders are encrypted for your PC security problems.
