## Microsoft Windows Server 2003 end-of-support

Microsoft ended extended support for Windows Server 2003 on July 14, 2015. If you are running Windows Server 2003, this may put your applications and business at risk, since there may be no security or software updates. You can still move a Windows Server 2003 VM to Azure, and receive assistance in troubleshooting issues that concern running Windows Server 2003 on Azure. However, this support is limited to issues that don't require OS-level troubleshooting or patch.

Machines running Windows 2003 will no longer receive Microsoft support and may not receive further security updates. Additionally, many compliance requirements include being on a currently supported operating system.

Migrating your applications to Azure instances running a newer version of Windows Server is the recommended approach to ensure that you are effectively leveraging the flexibility and reliability of the Azure cloud. Pre-configured images with different combinations of Windows and SQL Server are available in the Marketplace and enable you to run any compatible solution on our cost-effective, high-performance, reliable cloud computing platform. For more information, see [Windows Server 2003 migration strategy](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/windows-server-2003).
