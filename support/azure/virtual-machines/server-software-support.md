# Microsoft server software support for Azure virtual machines

This article discusses the support policy for running Microsoft server software in the Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine environment (infrastructure-as-a-service).

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Virtual Machine running Windows, Cloud Services (Web roles/Worker roles)  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2721672

## Summary

Microsoft supports server software that runs in the Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine environments, as described in the "Supported software" section. This support is subject to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy. For more information, go to the following Microsoft website: [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](/lifecycle).

All Microsoft, software that's installed in the Azure virtual machine environment must be licensed correctly. By default, Azure virtual machines include a license for using Windows Server in the Microsoft Azure environment. Certain Azure virtual machine offerings may also include additional Microsoft software on a per-hour or evaluation basis. Licenses for other software must be obtained separately. For information about the Microsoft License Mobility program, see [Volume licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/software-assurance/license-mobility.aspx).

In some cases, specific versions of Microsoft server software are required for support. These versions are noted in this article, and the supported versions may be updated as required.

Microsoft does not support an upgrade of the operating system of a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine. (For more information, see KB [4014997](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4014997).) Instead, you should create a new Azure virtual machine that is running the supported version of the operating system that is required and then migrate the workload. Instructions for how to migrate Windows Server roles and features are available in the following TechNet topic: [Install, use, and remove Windows Server migration tools](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj134202).

## Supported software

Microsoft supports the following Microsoft server software that's running in the Azure virtual machine environment:

### Azure AD Connect

Azure AD Connect is supported. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-prerequisites).

> [!NOTE]
> The only supported way to send email to external domains from Azure compute resources is through an SMTP relay (otherwise known as an SMTP smart host). The Azure compute resource sends the email message to the SMTP relay, and then the SMTP relay provider delivers the message to the external domain. Microsoft Exchange Online Protection is one provider of a SMTP relay, but a number of third-party providers also offer this service.

### Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager

Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 SP1 and later versions are supported.

## Windows Server

Windows Server 2016 Standard is not available in the Azure Marketplace.

Windows Server 2003 and later versions are supported for deployment in Microsoft Azure.  Click [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3206074) to see more information about running Windows Server 2003 on Azure.

For versions that are earlier than Windows Server 2008 R2, there is no Azure Marketplace support, and customers must provide their own images. The ability to deploy an operating system on Microsoft Azure is independent of the support status of the operating system. Microsoft does not support operating systems that are past their [End of Support date](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search) without a Custom Support Agreement (CSA). For example, Windows Server 2003/2003 R2 is no longer supported without a CSA.

Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions are supported for the following roles unless explicitly noted otherwise (this list will be updated as new roles are confirmed):

- Active Directory Certificate Services

    > [!NOTE]
    > Whether you're extending an existing public key infrastructure (PKI) or planning to deploy a new PKI in the Azure environment, there are best practices, policies, and recommendations to mitigate many of the common insecurities and shortcomings. Not all the recommendations are applicable to every customer scenario. Consider the level of protection that is required for your business through a risk assessment. Before you deploy, make sure that you can implement those controls.
