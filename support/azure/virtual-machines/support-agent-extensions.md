## More information

Understanding the difference between the VM agent and VM extensions helps troubleshoot problems by isolating the location of the problem.

The VM agent lets you start, run, and monitor a VM extension that will perform specific tasks in the virtual machine (VM).

The VM agent has to be running for the agent to run extensions.

### How do I know whether the problem is with the agent or with extensions?

The VM agent consists of three services that must be running:

- RDAgent
- Windows Azure Guest Agent
- Microsoft Azure Telemetry Service

Make sure that these three services are running, and then check the extensions installation and startup.

Steps to verify the installation/startup error for the extensions:

When the agent is running, it will log a summary of extensions operations. This summary includes the following:

- Enable
- Install
- Start
- Disable

You can find the summary log at `C:\WindowsAzure\logs\WaAppAgent.log`.

To determine which extension is failing, open the log, and then look for the word "error" in the log.

An example of an error in starting the VMAccess extension is as follows:

```
[00000019] [04/08/2014 23:25:06.83] [INFO] plugin (name: Microsoft.Compute.VMAccessAgent, version: 1.0.3) enabled successfully., Code: 0
[00000028] [04/08/2014 23:25:07.80] [INFO] Successfully installed plugin Microsoft.Compute.BGInfo 1.1.
[00000028] [04/08/2014 23:25:07.80] [INFO] plugin (name: Microsoft.Compute.BGInfo, version: 1.1) enabled successfully. Code: 0
[00000003] [04/08/2014 23:27:04.11] [ERROR] Install command of Microsoft.Compute.VMAccessAgent has not exited on time! Killing it...
```

Use the table that is mentioned before to request support for the extension that is failing.
