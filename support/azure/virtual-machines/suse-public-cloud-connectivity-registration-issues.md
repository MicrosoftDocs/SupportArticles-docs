# Troubleshoot connectivity and registration issues for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server VMs

This article addresses a situation in which an Azure virtual machine (VM) is set up by using a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) image, but the VM can't connect to the SUSE Subscription Management Tool (SMT) repository. The article describes some basic troubleshooting steps, and it outlines actions to take for specific scenarios (such as failures in Zypper, which is the SUSE command-line tool for managing packages). This information was assembled by Linux specialists at Microsoft, and it's based on support experience and documentation from SUSE.

It's important to read the output of each command for additional clues. We recommend that you save the results and messages for further troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- Internet access from the VM.
- The [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) language interpreter.
- The Client URL ([curl](https://curl.se/download.html)) tool.
- The [Zypper](https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped-temp/zypper/) package manager.
- The [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/) toolkit.
- The [SUSEConnect](https://github.com/SUSE/connect) tool.
- The [registercloudguest](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/cloud-regionsrv-client/blob/master/man/man1/registercloudguest.1) tool.

## Run a repository diagnostic script

Run the [SUSEcloud repocheck script](https://github.com/rfparedes/susecloud-repocheck) that's provided by Rich Paredes, a SUSE engineer. This Python script will do the following tasks:

1. Check for connectivity to the SUSE public cloud repositories.

1. Try to fix any existing issues.

1. Create a log archive in the */var/log/* directory, and name it *sc-repocheck_\<YYMMDD_hhmmss>.tar.xzq*. This log might be useful if the connection or registration issues persist.

To start the script, run the following command to transfer the script from its GitHub location onto the Python interpreter:

```bash
python3 <(curl --location --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfparedes/susecloud-repocheck/main/sc-repocheck.py)
```

To run successfully, the command requires internet access from the VM. Otherwise, you'll have to download the script first, and then modify the command so that it will run.

## Check connectivity to server IP addresses on port 443

The VM must be able to open a TCP connection on port 443 to the SUSE repository server `smt-azure.susecloud.net` (based on the region where the VM is located) together with the region servers. The list of IP addresses for the repository server and the region servers can be found at the following locations.

| IP address type | URL containing the IP address list |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| SMT server IP addresses for all the regions | <https://susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com/v1/microsoft/servers/smt.xml> |
| Region server IP addresses | <https://susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com/v1/microsoft/servers/regionserver.xml> |

To check the repository server and region server connections for your region, use the [OpenSSL s_client command](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man1/openssl-s_client.html) for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) clients. Insert the appropriate IP address for the placeholder into the following syntax:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect <IP address>:443
```

After you run this command, the server certificate is displayed. The command also initiates a proper SSL connection.

The following example shows successful command output for the SUSE repository server in the East US 2 region (location code `eastus2`, IP address `20.186.112.116`):

```console
$ echo "" | openssl s_client -connect 20.186.112.116:443

## Cause 1: No server certificate or SSL session shown

The output doesn't show the server certificate or SSL session. This scenario often occurs if the command traverses a network virtual appliance (NVA) that does SSL packet inspection. This inspection causes the NVA to inject its own SSL certificate into the encrypted session. Because SUSE uses certificate pinning, another injected SSL certificate can break the pinning operation. If pinning is broken, the SUSE repository denies the connection.

### Action: Fix the network virtual appliance configuration

Make sure that the network virtual appliance doesn't do the following:

- Block access to the SUSE repository IP addresses.
- Do SSL packet inspection on the secure connection to the SUSE repositories.
- Insert the NVA SSL certificate on the server.

## Cause 2: Outdated cloud infrastructure information

SUSE made a [public cloud infrastructure update](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019633) on June 1, 2020. This change might cause connectivity issues for older VMs.

### Action: Update the SUSE public cloud infrastructure

On a problematic VM, you have to download and extract an Azure offline update, and then use Zypper to update the packages manually. Run the following commands by replacing the `<SLE-base>` placeholder with the version of the SLES that's used on the VM (either `SLE12` or `SLE15`):

```bash
archiveFileName=late_instance_offline_update_azure_<SLE-base>.tar.gz
wget --no-check-certificate https://52.188.224.179/$archiveFileName
sha1sum $archiveFileName
tar --extract --file=$archiveFileName
cd x86_64
zypper --no-refresh --no-remote --non-interactive install *.rpm
```

## Cause 3: Unprocessable entity errors

SUSE now requires that VMs use attested data when they connect to the SUSE public cloud infrastructure. Otherwise, the following error is logged in the */var/log/cloudregister* file:

>2021-06-22 17:27:33,950 ERROR: Unable to obtain product information from server "52.157.241.14,None"
>
>Unprocessable Entity
>
>{  
> "type": "error",  
> "error": "The requested product 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP1 x86_64' is not activated on this system.",  
> "localized_error": "The requested product 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP1 x86_64' is not activated on this system."  
>}
>
>Unable to register modules, exiting.

### Action: Update to the latest Azure and Azure Hybrid Benefit packages

If you install the public cloud infrastructure update and Azure Hybrid Benefit, your VM will use attested data and avoid unprocessable entity errors. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you install the [Azure offline update for the SUSE public cloud infrastructure](#action-update-the-suse-public-cloud-infrastructure) from Cause 2.

1. Run the following commands on the VM to install the [Azure Hybrid Benefit for SUSE Linux Enterprise](https://www.suse.com/c/suse-linux-enterprise-and-azure-hybrid-benefit/). Again, replace the `<SLE-base>` placeholder with the VM SLES version (`SLE12` or `SLE15`):

    ```bash
    ahbFileName=late_instance_offline_ahb_<SLE-base>.tar.gz
    wget --no-check-certificate https://52.188.224.179/$ahbFileName
    sha1sum $ahbFileName
    tar --extract --file=$ahbFileName
    cd late_update
    zypper --no-refresh --no-remote --non-interactive install *.rpm
    ```

1. Rerun the [diagnostic script](#run-a-repository-diagnostic-script) to fix the repository issues.

## Cause 4: General registration issues

Your VM has stale credentials for repository access, or you get messages about your system not being registered after you try to make updates or installations.

### Action: Force registration

To fix most registration issues, specify the combination of the [SUSEConnect](https://github.com/SUSE/connect/blob/master/SUSEConnect.8.ronn) cleanup command and the [registercloudguest](https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/cloud-regionsrv-client/blob/master/man/man1/registercloudguest.1) command by using the **force-new** parameter:

```bash
SUSEConnect --cleanup
registercloudguest --force-new
```

If those commands don't fix the registration, try running the following SUSEConnect command to get the current registration status, including the name of the SLES SAP product:

```bash
SUSEConnect --url https://smt-azure.susecloud.net --status-text
```

Using that product name, run this SUSEConnect command to activate the product:

```bash
SUSEConnect --url https://smt-azure.susecloud.net --product <SLES-SAP-Product-name>
```

If those commands are unsuccessful, clean up all repository information, and then try to register the VM. Then, any errors that are related to the certificates and other components should disappear. Run the following commands:

```bash
SUSEConnect --cleanup
rm /etc/zypp/{credentials,services,repos}.d/*
rm --force --recursive /var/cache/zypp/*
rm /var/lib/cloudregister/*
registercloudguest --force-new
```

Finally, verify the VM registration status by running SUSEConnect again:

```bash
SUSEConnect --status
```

In the JSON command output, look for a `"status":"Registered"` entry.

## Cause 5: No attested data supplied (422)

After you run the [repository diagnostic script](#run-a-repository-diagnostic-script), you might experience the following error while the script tries to fix issues that affect the Zypper update:

> Error: Activating SLES_SAP 12.5 x86_64 ... Error: Registration server returned 'Instance verification failed: No attested data supplied' (422)

### Action: Fix the Zypper update issue

1. If you haven't already done this, [update the SUSE public cloud infrastructure](#action-update-the-suse-public-cloud-infrastructure), as described in Cause 2.

1. Run the [diagnostic script](#run-a-repository-diagnostic-script) again.

1. If the "422" error persists, modify the */etc/regionserverclnt.cfg* configuration file to resemble the following text:

    ```config
    [server]
    api = regionInfo
    certLocation = /var/lib/regionService/certs
    regionsrv = 23.100.36.229,40.121.202.140,52.187.53.250,104.45.31.195,191.237.254.253
    
    [instance]
    dataProvider = /usr/bin/azuremetadata --api latest --subscriptionId --billingTag --attestedData --signature --xml
    instanceArgs = msftazure
    httpsOnly = true
    ```

## Next steps

If you require further help, see [Support and troubleshooting for Azure VMs](/azure/virtual-machines/vm-support-help). That article can also help you file an Azure support incident, if necessary. As you follow the instructions, keep a copy of the *sc-repocheck_\<YYMMDD_hhmmss>.tar.xzq* log archive because it might be requested for inspection by the support engineer.
