For other VM deployment issues and questions, see [Troubleshoot deploying Windows virtual machine issues in Azure](troubleshoot-deploy-vm-windows.md).

## Collect activity logs
To start troubleshooting, collect the activity logs to identify the error associated with the issue. The following links contain detailed information on the process to follow.

**Y:** If the OS is Windows generalized, and it is uploaded and/or captured with the generalized setting, then there won’t be any errors. Similarly, if the OS is Windows specialized, and it is uploaded and/or captured with the specialized setting, then there won’t be any errors.

**Upload Errors:**

**N<sup>1</sup>:** If the OS is Windows generalized, and it is uploaded as specialized, you will get a provisioning timeout error with the VM stuck at the OOBE screen.

**N<sup>2</sup>:** If the OS is Windows specialized, and it is uploaded as generalized, you will get a provisioning failure error with the VM stuck at the OOBE screen because the new VM is running with the original computer name, username and password.

**Resolution**

To resolve both these errors, use [Add-AzVhd to upload the original VHD](/powershell/module/az.compute/add-azvhd), available on-premises, with the same setting as that for the OS (generalized/specialized). To upload as generalized, remember to run sysprep first.

**Capture Errors:**

**N<sup>3</sup>:** If the OS is Windows generalized, and it is captured as specialized, you will get a provisioning timeout error because the original VM is not usable as it is marked as generalized.

**N<sup>4</sup>:** If the OS is Windows specialized, and it is captured as generalized, you will get a provisioning failure error because the new VM is running with the original computer name, username, and password. Also, the original VM is not usable because it is marked as specialized.

**Resolution**

To resolve both these errors, delete the current image from the portal, and [recapture it from the current VHDs](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/create-vm-specialized) with the same setting as that for the OS (generalized/specialized).

## Issue: Custom/gallery/marketplace image; allocation failure
This error arises in situations when the new VM request is pinned to a cluster that either cannot support the VM size being requested, or does not have available free space to accommodate the request.

**Cause 1:** The cluster cannot support the requested VM size.

**Resolution 1:**

* Retry the request using a smaller VM size.
* If the size of the requested VM cannot be changed:
  * Stop all the VMs in the availability set.
    Click **Resource groups** > *your resource group* > **Resources** > *your availability set* > **Virtual Machines** > *your virtual machine* > **Stop**.
  * After all the VMs stop, create the new VM in the desired size.
  * Start the new VM first, and then select each of the stopped VMs and click **Start**.

**Cause 2:** The cluster does not have free resources.

**Resolution 2:**

* Retry the request at a later time.
* If the new VM can be part of a different availability set
  * Create a new VM in a different availability set (in the same region).
  * Add the new VM to the same virtual network.

## Next steps
If you encounter issues when you start a stopped Windows VM or resize an existing Windows VM in Azure, see [Troubleshoot Resource Manager deployment issues with restarting or resizing an existing Windows Virtual Machine in Azure](restart-resize-error-troubleshooting.md).
