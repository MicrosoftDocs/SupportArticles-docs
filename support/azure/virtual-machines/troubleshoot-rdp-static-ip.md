# Cannot remote desktop to Azure Virtual Machines because of static IP

This article describes a problem in which you cannot remote desktop to Azure Windows Virtual Machines (VMs) after a static IP is configured in the VM.

## Symptoms

When you make an RDP connection to a VM in Azure, you receive the following error message:

**Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons:**

1. **Remote access to the server is not enabled**

2. **The remote Computer is turned off**

3. **The remote computer is not available on the network**

**Make sure the remote computer is turned on and connected to the network, and that remote access is enabled.**

When you check the screenshot in the [Boot diagnostics](/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/boot-diagnostics) in the Azure portal, you see the VM boots normally and waits for credentials in the login screen.

## Cause

The VM has a static IP address that's defined on the network interface within Windows. This IP address differs from the address that's defined in the Azure portal.

## Solution

Before you follow these steps, take a snapshot of the OS disk of the affected VM as a backup. For more information, see [Snapshot a disk](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/snapshot-copy-managed-disk).

To resolve this issue, use Serial control to enable DHCP or [reset network interface](reset-network-interface.md) for the VM.

### Use Serial control

1. Connect to [Serial Console and open CMD instance](./serial-console-windows.md#use-cmd-or-powershell-in-serial-console
). If the Serial Console is not enabled on your VM, see [Reset network interface](reset-network-interface.md).
2. Check if the DHCP is disabled on the network interface:

    ```console
    netsh interface ip show config
    ```

3. If the DHCP is disabled, revert the configuration of your network interface to use DHCP:

    ```console
    netsh interface ip set address name="<NIC Name>" source=dhcp
    ```

    For example, if the interwork interface names "Ethernet 2", run the following command:

    ```console
    netsh interface ip set address name="Ethernet 2" source=dhcp
    ```

4. Query the IP configuration again to make sure that the network interface is now correctly set up. The new IP address should match the one thatâ€™s provided by the Azure.

    ```console
    netsh interface ip show config
    ```

    You don't have to restart the VM at this point. The VM will be back reachable.

After that, if you want to configure the static IP for the VM, see [Configure static IP addresses for a VM](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-pportal).
