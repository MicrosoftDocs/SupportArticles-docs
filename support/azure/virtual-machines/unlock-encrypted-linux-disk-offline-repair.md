# Unlocking an encrypted Linux disk for offline repair

This article describes how to unlock an Azure Disk Encryption (ADE)-enabled OS disk for offline repair.

Azure Disk Encryption can be applied to Microsoft endorsed Linux virtual machines (VMs). Here are some basic requirements to enable Azure Disk Encryption in Linux VMs:

- Azure Key Vault
- Azure CLI or Windows PowerShell cmdlets
- [Device-mapper (DM)-Crypt](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/wikis/DMCrypt)

## Symptoms

If ADE is enabled on the OS disk, you might receive the following error messages after you try to mount the disk on a repair VM:  

   > mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sda2, missing codepage or helper program, or other error
  
   > mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'

## Preparation

Before you unlock the encrypted OS disk for offline repair, complete the following tasks:

1. [Confirm that ADE is enabled on the disk](#verify-that-ade-is-enabled-on-the-disk).
2. [Determine whether the OS disk uses ADE version 0 (dual-pass encryption) or ADE version 1 (single-pass encryption)](#adeversion).
3. [Determine whether the OS disk is managed or unmanaged](#determine-whether-the-os-disk-is-managed-or-unmanaged).
4. [Select the method to unlock the encrypted disk](#select-the-method-to-unlock-the-encrypted-disk).

### Verify that ADE is enabled on the disk

You can do this step in the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI).

#### Azure portal

View the **Overview** blade for the failed VM in the Azure portal. Beneath **Disk**, the **Azure disk encryption** entry will appear as either **Enabled** or **Not Enabled**, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="media/unlock-encrypted-linux-disk-offline-repair/ade-enabled.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the overview blade for a V M in azure portal showing that A D E is enabled on the disk.":::

#### PowerShell

You can use the `Get-AzVmDiskEncryptionStatus` cmdlet to determine whether the OS or data volumes for a VM are encrypted by using ADE. The following example output indicates that ADE encryption is enabled on the OS volume:

```PowerShell
Get-AzVmDiskEncryptionStatus -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroupName" -VMName "VmName" 
```

For more information about the `Get-AzureRmDiskEncryptionStatus` cmdlet, see [Get-AzVMDiskEncryptionStatus (Az.Compute)](/powershell/module/az.compute/get-azvmdiskencryptionstatus).

#### Azure CLI

You can use the `az vm encryption show` command to check whether ADE is enabled on VM disks:

```azurecli
az vm encryption show --name MyVM --resource-group MyResourceGroup --query "disks[].encryptionSettings[].enabled"
```

For more information about the `az vm encryption show` command, see [az vm encryption show](/cli/azure/vm/encryption#az-vm-encryption-show).

> [!NOTE]
> If ADE is not enabled on the disk, see the following article to learn how to attach a disk to a repair VM:
> [Troubleshoot a Linux VM by attaching the OS disk to a repair VM](troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux.md).

<a name="adeversion"></a>

### Determine whether the OS disk uses ADE version 0 (dual-pass encryption) or ADE version 1 (single-pass encryption)

You can identify the ADE version in the Azure portal by opening the properties of the VM, and then selecting **Extensions** to open the **Extensions** blade. On the **Extensions** blade, view the version number of **AzureDiskEncryptionForLinux**.

- If the version number is ``0.*``, the disk uses dual-pass encryption.
- If the version number is `1.*` or a later version, the disk uses single-pass encryption.

If your disk uses ADE version 0 (dual-pass encryption), use the [Method 3](#method3) to unlock the disk.

### Determine whether the OS disk is managed or unmanaged

If you don't know whether the OS disk is managed or unmanaged, see [Determine if the OS disk is managed or unmanaged](unmanaged-disk-offline-repair.md#determine-if-the-os-disk-is-managed-or-unmanaged).

If the OS disk is an unmanaged disk, follow the steps in [Method 3](#method3) to unlock the disk.

### Select the method to unlock the encrypted disk

Choose one of the following methods to unlock the encrypted disk:

- If the disk is managed and encrypted by using ADE version 1, and your infrastructure and company policy allow you to assign a public IP address to a repair VM, use [Method 1: Unlock the encrypted disk automatically by using az vm repair command](#method1).
- If your disk is both managed and encrypted by using ADE version 1, but your infrastructure or company policy prevent you from assigning a public IP address to a repair VM, use [Method 2: Unlock the encrypted disk by the Key file in the BEK volume](#method2). Another reason to choose this method is if you lack the permissions to create a resource group in Azure.
- If either of these methods fails, or if the disk is unmanaged or encrypted by using ADE version 1 (dual-pass encryption), follow the steps in [Method 3](#method3) to unlock the disk.

## <a name="method1"></a> Method 1: Unlock the encrypted disk automatically by using az vm repair command

This method relies on [az vm repair](/cli/azure/vm/repair) commands to automatically create a repair VM, attach the OS disk of the failed Linux VM to that repair VM, and then unlock the disk if it's encrypted. This method requires using a public IP address for the repair VM, and it unlocks the encrypted disk regardless of whether the ADE key is unwrapped or wrapped by using a key encryption key (KEK).  

To repair the VM by using this automated method, follow the steps in [Repair a Linux VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands](repair-linux-vm-using-azure-virtual-machine-repair-commands.md).

If your infrastructure and company policy don't allow you to assign a public IP address, or if the `az vm repair` command doesn't unlock the disk, go to the next method.

## <a name="method2"></a> Method 2: Unlock the encrypted disk by the key file in the BEK volume

To unlock and mount the encrypted disk manually, follow these steps:

1. [Create a new repair VM, and attach the encrypted disk to this VM during VM creation](#create-a-repair-vm).

   You must attach the encrypted disk when you create the repair VM. This is because the system detects that the attached disk is encrypted. Therefore, it fetches the ADE key from your Azure key vault, and then creates a new volume that's named "BEK VOLUME" to store the key file.

2. [Log in to the repair VM, then unmount any mounted partitions on the encrypted disk](#unmount-any-mounted-partitions-on-the-encrypted-disk).
3. [Identify the ADE key file in the BEK volume](#unmount-any-mounted-partitions-on-the-encrypted-disk).
4. [Identify the header file in the boot partition of the encrypted OS](#identify-the-header-file).
4. [Unlock the encrypted disk by using the ADE key file and the header file](#unlock-by-files).
5. Mount the partition: [LVM](#lvm), [RAW or non-LVM](#non-lvm).

### Create a repair VM

1. [Take a snapshot of the encrypted OS disk](troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux.md#take-a-snapshot-of-the-os-disk).
1. [Create a disk from the snapshot](troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux.md#create-a-disk-from-the-snapshot). For the new disk, choose the same location and availability zone as that of the problem VM that you want to repair.
1. Create a VM that's based on the following guidelines:
   - In the Azure Marketplace, choose the same image for the repair VM that was used for the failed VM. (The OS version should be the same.)
   - Choose a size that allocates at least 8 GB of memory to the VM.  
   - Assign this new VM to the same resource group, region, and availability settings that you used for the new disk that you created in step 2.

1. On the **Disks** page of the **Create a Virtual Machine** wizard, attach the new disk (that you just created from the snapshot) as a data disk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because the encryption settings are detected only during the VM creation, make sure that you attach the disk when you create the VM. This enables a volume that contains the ADE key file to be added to the VM automatically.

### Unmount any mounted partitions on the encrypted disk

1. After the repair VM is created, SSH to your repair VM, log in by using the appropriate credentialsï¼Œand then elevate the account to root:

   ```bash
   sudo -s 
   ```

2. List the attached devices by using the **lsblk** command. In the output, you should see multiple attached disks. These disks include the active OS disk and the encrypted disk. They can appear in any order.

3. Identify the encrypted disk by using the following information:

   - The disk will have multiple partitions
   - The disk will not list the root directory ("/") as a mountpoint for any of its partitions.
   - The disk will match the size that you noted when you created it from the snapshot.

   In the following example, the output indicates that "sdd" is the encrypted disk. This is the only disk that has multiple partitions and that does not list "/" as a mountpoint.

   ![The image about the first example](media/unlock-encrypted-linux-disk-offline-repair/dev-sample-1.png)

4. Unmount any partitions on the encrypted data disk that have been mounted in the file system. For example, in the previous example, you would have to unmount both "/boot/efi"* and "/boot".

   ```bash
   umount /boot/efi 

   umount /boot 
   ```

### Identify the ADE key file

You must have both the key file and the header file to unlock the encrypted disk. The key file is stored in the BEK volume, and the header file is in the boot partition of the encrypted OS disk.

1. Determine which partition is the BEK volume:

   ```bash
   lsblk -fs | grep -i bek 
   ```

   The following example output indicates that sdb1 is the BEK volume:

   ```output
   >sdb1  vfat   BEK VOLUME      04A2-FE67 
   ```

   If no BEK volume exists, re-create the repair VM by having the encrypted disk attached. If the BEK volume still does not attach automatically, [try Method 3](#method3) to retrieve the BEK volume.

1. Create a directory that's named "azure_bek_disk" under the "/mnt" folder:

   ```bash
   mkdir /mnt/azure_bek_disk 
   ```

1. Mount the BEK volume in the "/mnt/azure_bek_disk" directory. For example, if sdb1 is the BEK volume, enter the following command:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/azure_bek_disk 
   ```

1. List the available devices again:

   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,LABEL,PARTLABEL,MOUNTPOINT  
   ```

   **Note:** You'll see that the partition that you determined to be the BEK volume is now mounted in "/mnt/azure_bek_disk."
1. View the contents in the "/mnt/azure_bek_disk/" directory:

   ```bash
   ls -l /mnt/azure_bek_disk
   ```

   You should see the following files in the output (the ADE key file is "LinuxPassPhraseFileName"):

   ```output
   >total 1 

    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 148 Aug  4 01:04 CRITICAL_DATA_WARNING_README.txt 
    -r-xr-xr-x 1 root root 172 Aug  4 01:04 LinuxPassPhraseFileName
    ```
  
   You may see multiple "LinuxPassPhraseFileName" if more than one disk is attached to the encrypted VM. The "LinuxPassPhraseFileName" will be enumerated according to the number of disks in the same order as their Logical Unit Numbers (LUNs).
  
### Identify the header file

The boot partition of the encrypted disk contains the header file. You'll use this file, together with the "LinuxPassPhraseFileName" key file, to unlock the encrypted disk.

1. Use the following command to show selected attributes of the available disks and partitions:

   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,LABEL,PARTLABEL,MOUNTPOINT
   ```

1. On the encrypted disk, identify the OS partition (root partition). This is the largest partition on the encrypted disk. In the previous example output, the OS partition is "sda4." This partition must be specified when you run the unlock command.
3. In the root directory ("/") of the file structure, create a directory to which to mount the root partition of the encrypted disk. You'll use this directory later, after the disk is unlocked. To distinguish it from the active OS partition of the repair VM, give it the name "investigateroot".

   ```bash
   mkdir /{investigateboot,investigateroot}
   ```

1. On the encrypted disk, identify the boot partition, which contains the header file. On the encrypted disk, the boot partition is the second largest partition that shows no value in the LABEL or PARTLABEL column. In the previous example output, the boot partition of the encrypted disk is "sda2."

1. Mount the boot partition that you identified in step 4 into the /investigateboot/ directory. In the following example, the boot partition of the encrypted disk is sda2. However, the location on your system might differ.

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sda2 /investigateboot/ 
   ```

   If mounting the partition fails and returns a "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock" error message, try again by using the `mount -o nouuid` command, as in the following example:

   ```bash
   mount -o nouuid /dev/sda2 /investigateboot/ 
   ```

1. List the files that are in the /investigateboot/ directory. The "luks" subdirectory contains the header file that you must have to unlock the disk.

1. List the files that are in the /investigateboot/luks/ directory. The header file is named "osluksheader."

   ```bash
   ls -l /investigateboot/luks 
   ```

### <a name="unlock-by-files"></a> Use the ADE key file and the header file to unlock the disk

1. Use the `cryptsetup luksOpen` command to unlock the root partition on the encrypted disk. For example, if the path to the root partition that contains the encrypted OS is /dev/sda4, and you want to assign the name "osencrypt" to the unlocked partition, run the following command:

   ```bash
   cryptsetup luksOpen --key-file /mnt/azure_bek_disk/LinuxPassPhraseFileName --header /investigateboot/luks/osluksheader /dev/sda4 osencrypt 
   ```

1. Now that you have unlocked the disk, unmount the encrypted disk's boot partition from the /investigateboot/ directory:

      ```bash
      umount /investigateboot/ 
      ```

   **Note:** You'll have to mount this partition to another directory later.

   The next step is to mount the partition that you have just unlocked. The method that you use to mount the partition depends on the device mapper framework (LVM or non-LVM) that's used by the disk.

1. List the device information together with the file system type:

      ```bash
      lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE 
      ```

   You'll see the unlocked partition and the name that you assigned to it (in our example, that name is "osencrypt"):

   - For the LVM partition such as "LVM_member", see [Mount the LVM partition](#lvm)[RAW or non-LVM](#non-lvm).
   - For the non-LVM partition, see [Mount the non-LVM partition](#non-lvm).

### <a name="lvm"></a> Mount the unlocked partition and enter the chroot environment (LVM only)

If the disks use the LVM device mapper framework, you have to take extra steps to mount the disk and enter the chroot environment. To use the chroot tool together with the encrypted disk, the unlocked partition ("osencrypt") and its logical volumes must be recognized as the volume group that's named rootvg. However, by default, the repair VM's OS partition and its logical volumes are already assigned to a volume group that has the name rootvg. We must resolve this conflict before we can continue.

1. Use the `pvs` command to display the properties of the LVM physical volumes. You might see warning messages, as in the following example, that indicate that the unlocked partition ("/dev/mapper/osencrypt") and another device are using duplicate universally unique identifiers (UUIDs). Alternatively, you might see two partitions assigned to rootvg.

    >[!NOTE]
    > You want only the unlocked partition ("osencrypt") to be assigned to the rootvg volume group so that you can access its logical volumes through the chroot utility. To fix this problem, you'll temporarily import the partition into a different volume group, and activate that volume group. Next, you'll rename the current rootvg volume group. Only after you enter the chroot environment will you rename the encrypted disk's volume group as "rootvg."

### Assigning the unlocked partition (example)

1. Import the newly unlocked partition into a new volume group. In this example, we are temporarily naming the new volume group "rescuemevg".
Import the newly unlocked partition into a new volume group. In this example, we are temporarily naming the new volume group "rescuemevg".

1. Activate the new volume group:

   ```bash
   vgimportclone -n rescuemevg /dev/mapper/osencrypt
   vgchange -a y rescuemevg
   ```

1. Rename the old rootvg volume group.  In this example, we will use the name "oldvg."

   ```bash
   vgrename rootvg oldvg 
   ```

1. Run `lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,LABEL,PARTLABEL,MOUNTPOINT` to review the available devices. You should now see both volume groups listed by the names that you assigned to them.

6. Mount the rescuemevg/rootlv logical volume to the /investigateroot/ directory without using the duplicate UUIDs:

   ```bash
   umount /investigateboot
   mount -o nouuid /dev/rescuemevg/rootlv /investigateroot/ 
   ```

   Now, the root partition of the failed VM is unlocked and mounted, and you should be able to access the root partition to troubleshoot the issues. For more information, see [Repair the VM offline](linux-recovery-cannot-start-file-system-errors.md#repair-the-vm-offline).

   However, if you want to use the chroot utility for troubleshooting, continue by using the following steps.

7. Mount the encrypted disk's boot partition to the directory /investigateroot/boot/ without using the duplicate UUIDs. (Remember that the encrypted disk's boot partition is the second largest that's assigned no partition label.) In our current example, the encrypted disk's boot partition is sda2.

   ```bash
   mount -o nouuid /dev/sda2 /investigateroot/boot
   ```

1. Mount the encrypted disk's EFI system partition to the /investigateroot/boot/efi directory. You can identify this partition by its label. In our current example, the EFI system partition is sda1.

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sda1 /investigateroot/boot/efi
   ```

1. Mount the remaining unmounted logical volumes in the encrypted disk's volume group to subdirectories of "/investigateroot/":

   ```bash
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/rescuemevg-varlv /investigateroot/var
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/rescuemevg-homelv /investigateroot/home
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/rescuemevg-usrlv /investigateroot/usr
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/rescuemevg-tmplv /investigateroot/tmp
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/rescuemevg-optlv /investigateroot/opt
   ```

1. Change the active directory to the mounted root partition on the encrypted disk:

      ```bash
      cd /investigateroot
      ```

1. Enter the following commands to prepare the chroot environment:

      ```bash
      mount -t proc proc proc
      mount -t sysfs sys sys/
      mount -o bind /dev dev/
      mount -o bind /dev/pts dev/pts/
      mount -o bind /run run/
      ```

12. Enter the chroot environment:

      ```bash
      chroot /investigateroot/
      ```

13. Rename the rescuemevg volume group to "rootvg" to avoid conflicts or possible issues with grub and initramfs. Keep the same naming convention when you regenerate initramfs. Because of the vg name changes, work on the rescue VM. It will no longer be useful if you restart it. The rescue VM should be considered to be a temporary VM.

      ```bash
      vgrename rescuemevg rootvg
      ```

14. Troubleshoot issues in the chroot environment. For example, you can read logs or run a script. For more information, see [Perform fixes in the chroot environment](chroot-logical-volume-manager.md#perform-fixes).
1. [Exit chroot and swap the OS disk](chroot-logical-volume-manager.md#exit-chroot-and-swap-the-os-disk).

### <a name="non-lvm"></a> Mount the unlocked disk, and enter the chroot environment (RAW/non-LVM)

1. In the root directory ("/") of the file structure, create a directory into which to mount the root partition of the encrypted disk. You'll use this directory later, after the disk is unlocked. To distinguish it from the active OS partition of the repair VM, name it to "investigateroot".

   ```bash
   mkdir /{investigateboot,investigateroot}
   ```

1. Mount the newly unlocked partition ("osencrypt") to the /investigateroot/ directory:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/mapper/osencrypt /investigateroot/ 
   ```

   If mounting the partition fails and returns a "wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock" error message, try again by using the mount `-o nouuid` command:

   ```bash
   mount -o nouuid /dev/mapper/osencrypt /investigateroot/ 
   ```

1. Try to display the contents of the /investigateroot/ directory to verify that the mounted partition is now unlocked:

   ```bash
   ls /investigateroot/ 
   ```

1. Now the root partition of the failed VM is unlocked and mounted, you can access the root partition to troubleshoot the issues. For more information, see [Repair the VM offline](linux-recovery-cannot-start-file-system-errors.md#repair-the-vm-offline).

      However, if you want to use the chroot utility for troubleshooting, go to the next step.

1. Use the command `lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,LABEL,PARTLABEL,MOUNTPOINT` to review the available devices. Identify the boot partition on the encrypted disk as the second largest partition that's assigned no label.

1. Mount the boot partition on the encrypted disk to the "/investigateroot/boot/" directory, as in the following example:

   ```bash
   mount /dev/sdc2 /investigateroot/boot/ 
   ```

1. Change the active directory to the mounted root partition on the encrypted disk:

   ```bash
   cd /investigateroot 
   ```

1. Enter the following commands to prepare the chroot environment:

   ```bash
   mount -t proc proc proc 

   mount -t sysfs sys sys/ 

   mount -o bind /dev dev/ 

   mount -o bind /dev/pts dev/pts/ 

   mount -o bind /run run/ 
   ```

1. Enter the chroot environment:

   ```bash
   chroot /investigateroot/ 
   ```

1. Troubleshoot issues in the chroot environment. You can read logs or run a script. For more information, see [Perform fixes in the chroot environment](chroot-logical-volume-manager.md#perform-fixes).
1. [Exit chroot and swap the OS disk](chroot-logical-volume-manager.md#exit-chroot-and-swap-the-os-disk).

## <a name="method3"></a>Method 3: Re-encrypt the disk to retrieve the key file, and unlock the encrypted disk

1. Create the repair VM, and attach a copy of the locked disk to a repair VM:

     - For a managed disk, see [Troubleshoot a Linux VM by attaching the managed OS disk to a repair VM](troubleshoot-recovery-disks-portal-linux.md).
     - For an unmanaged disk, use the Storage Explorer to create a copy of the affected VM's OS disk. For more information, see [Attach an unmanaged disk to a VM for offline repair](unmanaged-disk-offline-repair.md).
1. After you attach the encrypted disk as the data disk to the repair VM, use the Key Vault and Key Encrypted key (KEK) that used for the original VM to re-encrypt this data disk. This process will automatically generate and mount a BEK volume by using a BKE key file in the repair VM. You must not use the **EncryptFormatAll** option because the ADE extension could encrypt the boot sector on the data disk.

    - If the original VM is encrypted by **wrapped BEK**, run the following command.

       ```azurecli
        az vm encryption enable -g "resource group" --name "VMName" --disk-encryption-keyvault "keyvault"  --key-encryption-key "kek" --volume-type "data"
       ```

    - If the original VM is encrypted by **BEK**, run the following command:

       ```azurecli
      az vm encryption enable -g "resource group" --name "VMName" --disk-encryption-keyvault "keyvault"  --volume-type "data"
      ```

        To determine the values for **disk-encryption-keyvault** and **key-encryption-key**, run the following command:

        ```azurecli
        az vm encryption show --name "OriginalVmName" --resource-group "ResourceGroupName"
        ```

        In the following table, find the values in the output. If the **keyEncryptionKey** value is blank, your VM is encrypted by **BEK**.

        |  Parameter |  Value in the output | example  |
        |---|---|---|
        | disk-encryption-keyvault  |  diskEncryptionKey:id | /subscriptions/deb73ff9-0000-0000-0000-0000c7a96d37/resourceGroups/Thomas/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/ContosoKeyvault |
        | key-encryption-key  | keyEncryptionKey:KeyURI   | `https://ContosoKeyvault.vault.azure.net/keys/mykey/00000000987145a3b79b0ed415fa0000`|

1. Run the following command to check whether a new disk is attached:

     ```bash
     lsblk -f
     ```

    If a new disk is attached, go to [Identify the ADE key file in the BEK volume](#identify-the-header-file), and then continue following the provided steps to unlock the disk.
