# Updates are included in Windows Server images from Azure Marketplace

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4046813

## Frequently asked questions

**When were Microsoft images updated to include the .NET Framework 4.7?**

The .NET Framework 4.7 was released in May and was made available on Windows Update as a Recommended update. Because the Windows Server images include both Important and Recommended updates, the images that were released after May included the .NET Framework 4.7.

**Was there any notification of the change?**

The Windows Server images include the latest Important and Recommended updates that were available at the time that the image was created. Because the included updates align with what is available on Windows Update (Important and Recommended updates), there was no notification about changes to the Windows Server images.
