# Can't upgrade an Azure VM to a size that contains more than 64 vCPUs

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Virtual Machine running Windows, Virtual Machine running Linux, Virtual Machine running RedHat, Virtual Machine running Ubuntu  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4131519

## Symptoms

You may experience errors when you try to upgrade your VM to a size that contains more than 64 vCPU's, such as Standard_F72s_v2.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the operating system that runs on the VM doesn't support more than 64 vCPU's.  

More than 64 vCPU's require one of the following supported guest operating systems: Windows Server 2016, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, SLES 12 SP2, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS 7.3, or Oracle Linux 7.3 with LIS 4.2.1.
