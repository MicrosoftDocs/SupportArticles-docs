# Activate Windows on Azure VMs Using a MAK Key

If you have a **Multiple Activation Key (MAK)** from your Volume Licensing agreement and want to use it on an Azure VM, follow these steps.

## **Deploy the VM**
- Create a Windows VM in Azure as usual (from Marketplace or a custom image).
- Choose the edition that matches your MAK entitlement (for example, **Windows Server Datacenter** or **Windows 11 Enterprise**).

## **Log into the VM**
- Once the VM is running, connect via **Remote Desktop (RDP)**.


## **Install the MAK Key**
Run the following commands in an **elevated Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** session:

```
slmgr /ipk XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
slmgr /ato
```

/ipk installs your MAK key.
/ato activates the VM directly with Microsoft’s activation servers.
XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX is your key

## Verify Activation
To confirm activation status, run:
```
slmgr.vbs /dlv
```
This displays the license details and confirms activation with a MAK key.

## Things to Keep in Mind

* Activation count: Each MAK key has a limited number of activations. Every Azure VM you activate consumes one.
* Connectivity: The VM must be able to reach Microsoft’s activation servers (via internet or proxy).
* Best practice: MAK is typically used for isolated or offline systems. For VMs that remain in Azure, KMS or Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) is simpler.
* Custom images: If deploying many VMs with MAK, you can embed the MAK key in a generalized image (Sysprep + slmgr /ipk) and deploy from that image.
