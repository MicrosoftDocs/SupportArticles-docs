# Multiple certificates on an Azure IaaS VM that uses extensions

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

This article discusses how to handle an issue in which multiple certificates are generated on a Microsoft Azure infrastructure as a service (IaaS) virtual machine (VM) that uses extensions.

## Symptoms

The symptoms of this issue vary depending on which platform you use for the IaaS VM, as shown in the following table.

| IaaS VM platform | Symptoms |
|-|-|
| Windows | When you browse the Certificates snap-in of the Microsoft Management Console, you find numerous instances of certificates that have a subject name of **Windows Azure CRP Certificate Generator**. (On a classic RedDog Front End (RDFE) VM, the certificates have a subject name of **Windows Azure Service Management for Extensions**.) |
| Linux | In the */var/lib/waagent* folder, you find several files that have names that contain 40 hexadecimal digits and a *.crt* (certificate) file name extension (for example, *0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF01234567.crt*). |

For Windows VMs, see the following section to learn how to verify these symptoms.

#### Windows

In Windows, if you view the *C:\\WindowsAzure\\logs\\WaAppAgent.log* log file, you notice a pattern that resembles the following text:

```output

```

If you see this kind of pattern, follow these steps to verify that you have multiple certificates that have the same subject name:

1. On the Windows **Start** menu, search for and select *MMC.exe* to open the Microsoft Management Console.

1. On the **File** menu of the Microsoft Management Console, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

1. In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, under the list of **Available snap-ins**, select **Certificates**, and then select the **Add** button.

1. In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select **Computer Account**, and then select **Next** > **Finish**.

1. In the **Add or Remove Snap-ins** dialog box, select the **OK** button.

1. In the console tree, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, expand **Personal**, and then select **Certificates**. A list of certificates appears. All the certificates have an **Issued By** column value of **Windows Azure CRP Certificate Generator** (or **Windows Azure Service Management for Extensions** if you're using a classic RDFE VM).

## Cause: Stopping and starting the VM every day

The multiple-certificate issue can occur if you stop and start the VM every day. When you use the VM in this manner, a new certificate must be issued after each VM restart.

## Solution 1: Delete the old certificates

You can delete the old certificates and keep only the latest certificates. The VM agent automatically re-creates the certificate if it's necessary.

## Solution 2: Update the VM agent

You can update to a more recent version of the VM agent so that the old certificates are automatically deleted. For more information, refer to the following table.
