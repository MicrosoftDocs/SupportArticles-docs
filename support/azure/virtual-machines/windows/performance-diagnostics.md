# Troubleshoot performance issues on Azure virtual machines using Performance Diagnostics

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

You can use the Performance Diagnostics tool to identify and troubleshoot performance issues on your Azure virtual machine (VM) in one of two modes:

* **Continuous diagnostics (preview)** collects data at five-second intervals and reports actionable insights about high resource usage every five minutes. Continuous diagnostics (preview) is currently supported only on Windows.
* **On-demand diagnostics** helps you troubleshoot an ongoing performance issue by providing more in-depth data, insights, and recommendations that are based on data that's collected at a single moment. On-demand diagnostics is supported on both Windows and Linux.

Performance Diagnostics stores all insights and reports in a storage account that you can configure for short data retention to minimize costs.

Run Performance Diagnostics directly from the Azure portal, where you can also review insights and a report about various logs, rich configuration, and diagnostics data. We recommend that you run Performance Diagnostics and review the insights and diagnostics data before you contact Microsoft Support.

This article explains how to use Performance Diagnostics and what the continuous and on-demand modes offer. 

> [!NOTE]
> Continuous diagnostics (preview) is currently supported only on Windows. On Windows VMs, you'll see the option to enable both on-demand and continuous diagnostics. On Linux VMs, you'll see the option to enable on-demand diagnostics. For more information, see [Install and run Performance Diagnostics on your VM](#install-and-run-performance-diagnostics-on-your-vm).

## Prerequisites

* To run continuous and on-demand diagnostics on Windows, you need [.NET SDK](/dotnet/core/install/windows) version 4.5 or a later version installed.

> [!NOTE]
> To run Performance Diagnostics on classic VMs, see [Azure Performance Diagnostics VM extension](performance-diagnostics-vm-extension.md).

Performance Diagnostics reports might contain several insights. Every insight includes recommendations.

The **Impact** column indicates an impact level of High, Medium, or Low to indicate the potential for performance issues, based on factors such as misconfiguration, known problems, or issues that are reported by other users. You might not yet be experiencing one or more of the listed issues. For example, you might have SQL log files and database files on the same data disk. This condition has a high potential for bottlenecks and other performance issues if the database usage is high. However, you might not notice an issue if the usage is low.

Select the **Download report** button to download an HTML report that contains richer diagnostics information, such as storage and network configuration, performance counters, traces, list of processes, and logs. The content depends on the selected analysis. For advanced troubleshooting, the report might contain additional information and interactive charts that are related to high CPU usage, high disk usage, and processes that consume excessive memory. For more information about the Performance Diagnostics report, see [Windows](how-to-use-perfinsights.md#review-the-diagnostics-report) or [Linux](../linux/how-to-use-perfinsights-linux.md#review-the-diagnostics-report).

> [!NOTE]
> You can download Performance Diagnostics reports from the **Performance Diagnostics** screen within 30 days after you generate them. After 30 days, you might receive an error Message when you download a report from the **Performance Diagnostics** screen. To get a report after 30 days, go to the storage account, and download the report from a binary large object (BLOB) container that's named *azdiagextnresults*. You can view the storage account information by using the **Settings** button on the toolbar.

## View and manage storage account and stored data

Performance Diagnostics stores all insights and reports in a storage account that you can [configure for short data retention](/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-policy-configure) to minimize costs.

To ensure Performance Diagnostics functions correctly, you must enable the **Allow storage account key access** setting for the storage account. To enable this setting, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your storage account.
2. In the storage account settings, locate the **Configuration** section.
3. Find the **Allow storage account key access** option and set it to **Enabled**.
4. Save your changes.

You can use the same storage account for multiple VMs that use Performance Diagnostics. When you change the storage account, the old reports and insights aren't deleted. However, they're no longer displayed in the list of diagnostics reports.

> [!NOTE]
> Performance Diagnostics stores insights in Azure tables and stores reports in a binary large object (BLOB) container.
>
> If your storage account uses [private endpoints](/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints), to make sure that Performance Diagnostics can store insights and reports in the storage account:
>
> 1. Create separate private endpoints for Table and BLOB.
> 1. Add DNS configuration to each separate private endpoint.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I share this data with Microsoft Support?

When you open a support ticket with Microsoft, it's important to share the Performance Diagnostics report from an on-demand Performance Diagnostics run. The Microsoft Support contact provides the option to upload the on-demand Performance Diagnostics report to a workspace. Use either of the following methods to download the on-demand Performance Diagnostics report:

**Option 1:** Download the report from the Performance Diagnostics blade, as described in [View Performance Diagnostics reports](#view-performance-diagnostics-reports).

**Option 2:** Download the report from the storage account, as described in [View and manage storage account and stored data](#view-and-manage-storage-account-and-stored-data).

### How do I capture diagnostics data at the correct time?

We recommend that you run Continuous Performance Diagnostics to capture VM diagnostics data on an ongoing basis.

The On-demand Performance Diagnostics run has the following stages:

- Install or update the Performance Diagnostics VM extension
- Run the diagnostics for the specified duration

Currently, there's no easy way to know exactly when the VM extension installation is completed. It takes about 45 seconds to 1 minute to install the VM extension. After the VM extension is installed, you can run your repro steps to have On-demand Performance Diagnostics capture the correct set of data for troubleshooting.

### Will Performance Diagnostics continue to work if I move my Azure VM across regions?

Azure VMs, and related network and storage resources, can be moved across regions by using Azure Resource Mover. However, moving VM extensions, including the Azure Performance Diagnostics VM extension, across regions isn't supported. You have to manually install the extension on the VM in the target region after you move the VM. For more information, see [Support matrix for moving Azure VMs between Azure regions](/azure/resource-mover/support-matrix-move-region-azure-vm).

### What is the performance impact of enabling Continuous Performance Diagnostics?

We ran 12-hour tests of Continuous Performance Diagnostics on a range of Windows OS versions, Azure VMs of sizes, and CPU loads.

The test results that are presented in this table show that Continuous Performance Diagnostics provides valuable insights by having a minimal effect on system resources.

| OS version              | VM size         | CPU load      | Avgerage CPU usage | 90th percentile CPU usage | 99th percentile CPU usage | Memory usage |
|-------------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Windows Server 2019     | B2s, A4V2, D5v2 | 20%, 50%, 80% | <0.5%              | 2%                      | 3%                      | 42-43 MB     |
| Windows Server 2016 SQL | B2s, A4V2, D5v2 | 20%, 50%, 80% | <0.5%              | 2%                      | 3%                      | 42-43 MB     |
| Windows Server 2019     | B2s, A4V2, D5v2 | 20%, 50%, 80% | <0.5%              | 2%                      | 3%                      | 42-43 MB     |
| Windows Server 2022     | B2s, A4V2, D5v2 | 20%, 50%, 80% | <0.5%              | <0.5%                   | 3%                      | 42-43 MB     |

#### Back-of-the-napkin calculations of storage costs

Continuous Performance Diagnostics stores insights in a table and a JSON file in a BLOB container. Given that each row is approximately 0.5 KB (kilobyte), and the report is approximately 9 KB before compression, two rows every five minutes plus the corresponding report upload equals 10 KB, or 0.00001 GB.

To calculate the storage cost:

* Rows per month: 17,280
* Size per row: 0.00001 GB

**Total data size:** 17,280 x 0.000001 = 0.1728 GB

**Data storage cost:** $0.1728 x  $0.045 = $0.007776 

Therefore, assuming steady stress on the VM, the storage cost is estimated to be less than one cent per month, assuming that you use locally redundant storage.
