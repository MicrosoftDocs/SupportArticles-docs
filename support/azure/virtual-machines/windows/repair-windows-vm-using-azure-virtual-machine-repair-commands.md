# Repair a Windows VM by using the Azure Virtual Machine repair commands

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

If your Windows virtual machine (VM) in Azure encounters a boot or disk error, you may need to repair the disk offline. A common example would be a failed application update that prevents the VM from being able to boot successfully. This article details how to use Azure VM repair commands to automatically attach a broken OS disk to another Windows VM for offline repair. Through this procedure, the failed OS disk will automatically be unlocked on the second VM, called a repair VM, if the disk is encrypted with Azure Disk Encryption. When the failed disk is attached to the repair VM, you can fix any errors and then rebuild your original VM with the repaired disk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> * The scripts in this article only apply to the VMs that use [Azure Resource Manager](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview).
> * Outbound connectivity from the VM (port 443) is required for the script to run.
> * Only one script may run at a time.
> * A running script cannot be canceled.
> * The maximum time a script can run is 90 minutes, after which it will time out.
> * Do not modify the tags that are created on the repair VM. The tags are neccessary for the restore command to function correctly.
> * For VMs using Azure Disk Encryption, only managed disks encrypted with single pass encryption (with or without KEK) are supported.

## Repair process overview

You can now use Azure VM repair commands to change the OS disk for a VM, and you no longer need to delete and recreate the VM.

The [Repair process example](#repair-process-example) section will guide you through the following process:

1. Launch Azure Cloud Shell.
2. Run `az extension add` or `az extension update`.
3. Run `az vm repair create`.
4. Run `az vm repair run` or perform mitigation steps.
5. Run `az vm repair restore`.

> [!NOTE]
> To view all available VM repair commands and parameters, see [az vm repair](/cli/azure/vm/repair).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run the commands, you need a role that can create the following types of resources in the subscription:
>
> * Resource Groups
> * Virtual Machines
> * Resource Tags
> * Virtual Networks
> * Network Security Groups
> * Network Interfaces
> * Disks
> * Public IP Addresses (Optional)

## Repair process example

1. Launch Azure Cloud Shell

   The Azure Cloud Shell is a free interactive shell that you can use to run the steps in this article. It includes common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account. If you run a script that will take longer than 20 minutes (for example: [win-sfc-sf-corruption](https://github.com/Azure/repair-script-library/blob/master/src/windows/win-sfc-sf-corruption.ps1) script), you may prefer to run the commands locally. To run the commands locally, Azure CLI version 2.0.67 or later version is required. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade your Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

   To open the Cloud Shell, select **Try it** from the upper-right corner of a code block. You can also open Cloud Shell in a separate browser tab by visiting [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com).

   Select **Copy** to copy the blocks of code, then paste the code into the Cloud Shell, and select **Enter** to run it.

   If you prefer to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires Azure CLI version 2.0.67 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade your Azure CLI, see [Install Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

   If you need to login to Cloud Shell with a different account than you are currently logged in to the Azure portal with you can use `az login` [az login reference](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login&preserve-view=true). To switch between subscriptions associated with your account you can use `az account set --subscription` [az account set reference](/cli/azure/account#az-account-set&preserve-view=true).

2. If this is the first time you have used the `az vm repair` commands, add the vm-repair CLI extension.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az extension add -n vm-repair
   ```

   If you have previously used the `az vm repair` commands, apply any updates to the vm-repair extension.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az extension update -n vm-repair
   ```

3. Run `az vm repair create`. This command will create a copy of the OS disk for the non-functional VM, create a repair VM in a new Resource Group, and attach the OS disk copy. The repair VM will be the same size and region as the non-functional VM specified. The Resource Group and VM name used in all steps will be for the non-functional VM. If your VM is using Azure Disk Encryption, use `--unlock-encrypted-vm` to unlock the encrypted disk so that it is accessible when attached to the repair VM. For more information, see [confirm that ADE is enabled on the disk](unlock-encrypted-disk-offline.md#confirm-that-ade-is-enabled-on-the-disk). If you need to troubleshoot your VM in a nested Hyper-V environment, use `--enable-nested` and the repair VM will created with the Hyper-V role enabled along with a nested VM using the OS disk copy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The run and restore commands will require all inputs to be entered using the same case as used in the create command, make note or refer to the tags on the repair VM to see what was used.

   Repair VM example

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm repair create -g MyResourceGroup -n myVM --repair-username username --repair-password 'password!234' --verbose
   ```

   Repair VM with Nested Hyper-V example

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm repair create -g MyResourceGroup -n myVM --repair-username username --repair-password 'password!234' --enable-nested --verbose
   ```

4. Run `az vm repair run`. This command will run the specified repair script on the attached disk via the repair VM. If the troubleshooting guide you are using specified a run-id, use it here. Otherwise, you can use `az vm repair list-scripts` to see available repair scripts. The Resource Group and VM name used here are for the non-functional VM used in step 3. Additional information about the repair scripts can be found in the [repair script library](https://github.com/Azure/repair-script-library).

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm repair run -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVM --run-on-repair --run-id win-hello-world --verbose
   ```

   Optionally you can perform any needed manual mitigation steps using the repair VM, then proceed to step 5.

5. Run `az vm repair restore`. This command will swap the repaired OS disk with the original OS disk of the VM. The Resource Group and VM name used here are for the non-functional VM used in step 3.

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm repair restore -g MyResourceGroup -n MyVM --verbose
   ```

## Verify and enable boot diagnostics

The following example enables the diagnostic extension on the VM named ``myVMDeployed`` in the resource group named ``myResourceGroup``:

Azure CLI

```azurecli-interactive
az vm boot-diagnostics enable --name myVMDeployed --resource-group myResourceGroup --storage https://mystor.blob.core.windows.net/
```

## Next steps

* If you are having issues connecting to your VM, see [Troubleshoot RDP connections to an Azure VM](./troubleshoot-rdp-connection.md).
* For issues with accessing applications running on your VM, see [Troubleshoot application connectivity issues on virtual machines in Azure](./troubleshoot-app-connection.md).
* For more information about using Resource Manager, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview).
