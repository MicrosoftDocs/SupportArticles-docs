# How to check Root Cause Analysis of unexpected Azure virtual machine reboots

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

Azure provides methods to access detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of unexpected reboots of Azure virtual machines (VMs) through the Azure portal. This article walks you through the steps to check RCA information in the Azure portal, ensuring that you can quickly identify and resolve the unexpected VM reboot issue.

## Method 1: Check resource health

1. Navigate to the impacted VM in the Azure portal.
2. Go to the **Help** section and then select **Resource health**.
3. Check the health events for the unexpected VM reboot to get RCA information.

## Method 2: Run diagnostics

1. Navigate to the impacted VM in the Azure portal.
2. Select **Diagnose and solve problems** > **Common problems** > **VM restarted or stopped unexpectedly**.

4. Once you select **My resource has been stopped unexpectedly**, the diagnostics run on the impacted VM. After the diagnostics are completed, you can check the reboot RCA information from the diagnostics result.

   > [!Note]
   > If more information is available about the root cause of the VM unavailability, the **Resource Health** tab may post additional details up to 72 hours after the VM is impacted. This type of RCA is only available for Azure VMs.
