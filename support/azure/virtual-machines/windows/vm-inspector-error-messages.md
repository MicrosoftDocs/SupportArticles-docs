# VM Inspector error messages and solutions

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

VM Inspector is a self-help diagnostic tool for remote users with privileged access. The tool is used on an Azure VM that runs Windows or Linux. When the Microsoft Azure VM Inspector tool discovers errors on an Azure virtual machine (VM), it returns specific error codes. The following table provides a comprehensive list of these error codes.

## Error messages

The following table describes the error codes that the VM Inspector can return after it makes diagnostic checks on an Azure VM.

## Common errors and solutions

The following are common issues when using VM Inspector and known solutions. 

### You don't have a role assignment that can run diagnostics

This error can occur when you use VM Inspector for the first time through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). As part of onboarding, the VM Inspector tool gets user consent to grant the Disk Backup reader role to the Compute Recommendation Service app. To add this role assignment, you should have Owner-level permissions.

For more information about the list of permissions that are needed to run VM Inspector, see [Get access to VM Inspector](vm-inspector-azure-virtual-machines.md#get-access-to-vm-inspector).

### Error message 403 "The client 'name' with object id 'value' does not have authorization to perform action 'Microsoft.Compute/locations/diagnostics/validateStorageConfiguration/action' over scope '/subscriptions/{0}' or the scope is invalid. If access was recently granted, please refresh your credentials"

This error can occur if you don't have enough permissions to invoke an API at the subscription level. The closest built-in role that you can use is [Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) at the subscription level.

### Error message 405 "Caller does not have access to perform action(s): '{0}' on storage account: '{1}'. Please check the full set of required permissions."

This error can occur if you don't have enough permissions to run VM Inspector on the virtual machine or storage account. For example, if you have a Service Administrator role or a Classic Administrator role on the resources (even if it's inherited from the subscription level), running VM Inspector will result in a Forbidden error.

For more information about the list of permissions that are needed to run VM Inspector, see [Get access to VM Inspector](vm-inspector-azure-virtual-machines.md#get-access-to-vm-inspector).
