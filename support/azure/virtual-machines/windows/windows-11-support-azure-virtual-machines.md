# Windows 11 support on Azure virtual machines

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

This article provides details about the applicable processors for Microsoft Azure virtual machines (VMs) that meet the requirements for Windows 11 support. Many of the VM products that are offered in Azure are supported by more than one configuration of physical hardware. Therefore, the underlying hardware generations can vary. Older VM products (such as D\*v2 and D\*v3 series VMs) can be installed on hosts that run older CPUs (such as Intel Broadwell and Haswell) and don't support Windows 11.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - [Windows 11 on Arm](/windows/arm/overview) is currently in Preview release. Current Arm CPUs in Azure meet the CPU requirements for Windows 11 support. However, Windows 11 Arm images in Azure Marketplace don't meet the requirements for some security options (trusted launch, secure boot, and trusted platform module (TPM), in particular).
>
> - The Azure portal might let you choose some VM products to deploy Windows 11 on, even if those VM products don't actually support Windows 11.
>
> - You currently can't upgrade to Windows 11, version 22H2 on Azure VMs that were deployed without trusted launch.
>
> - You can set trusted launch only during VM creation and only on Azure generation 2 VMs. There's no option to set trusted launch after you create the VM.

## Criteria for Windows 11 eligibility

There are multiple [criteria for Windows 11 eligibility](/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements#virtual-machine-support):

- **Generation**: 2nd
- **Storage**: At least 64 GB
- **Security**: Secure boot capable, trusted launch, virtual TPM (vTPM) enabled
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB
- **Processor**: Two or more virtual processors, and a VM host processor that meets Windows 11 processor requirements

The following sections provide more detail about the three main criteria: VM generation (version), trusted launch, and CPU.

### VM generation

VMs must be generation 2. You can't upgrade generation 1 VMs to generation 2.

### Trusted launch

VMs must be enabled for trusted launch together with secure boot and virtual TPM. Upgrading VMs from standard security to trusted launch isn't supported. Many VMs are affected by this requirement. This is because before [June 28, 2023](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/announcing-trusted-launch-as-default-in-azure-portal/ba-p/3854872), trusted launch wasn't the default security type option when you created a VM in the Azure portal. Also, when Windows 11 was released, trusted launch wasn't available as a feature in Windows Azure.

### CPU

The CPU requirements for Windows 11 have evolved. For an up-to-date list of supported processors, see [Windows processor requirements](/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements). The listed processors represent the processor models that meet the minimum floor for the supported processor generations through the latest processors at the time of publication. These processors meet the design principles regarding security and reliability, and they meet the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. Subsequently released and future generations of processors that meet the same principles are considered as supported, even if they aren't explicitly listed.

The processor list might specify the latest offerings from processor manufacturers between updates. In the [Windows 11 Minimum Hardware Requirements download file](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/8/8/788bf5ab-0751-4928-a22c-dffdc23c27f2/Minimum%20Hardware%20Requirements%20for%20Windows%2011.pdf#page=12), the *Processor* section (section 3.5) specifies a 1 GHz or faster processor that conforms to the following requirements:

- Supports two processor cores

- Is compatible with the x64 or ARM64 instruction set

- Supports the [PF_ARM_V81_ATOMIC_INSTRUCTIONS_AVAILABLE](/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-isprocessorfeaturepresent) instruction set (for ARM64 processors)

- Supports PAE, NX, and SSE4.1

- Supports CMPXCHG16b, LAHF/SAHF, and PrefetchW

- Meets the supported processor generation list requirements

Several CPUs that have been manufactured since 2008 meet these requirements other than the supported processor generation list. The processor generation information is documented in the following blog articles:

- A [June 28, 2021, Windows Insider Blog article](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements/) that specifies the following processors as supported:

  - Intel 8th generation and newer
  - AMD Zen 2 and newer
  - Qualcomm Series 7 and 8

- An [August 27, 2021, Windows Insider Blog article](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/) that adds more processors to the original supported list:

  - Intel Core X-Series 7th generation
  - Intel Xeon W-Series 7th generation
  - Intel Core 7820HQ (only selected devices that shipped with modern drivers based on Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps (DCH) design principles, including Surface Studio 2)

Processors that meet these principles are considered as supported, even if they might not appear on the supported processor list. The Intel Xeon Platinum 8370C is an example of a CPU that's supported, even though it doesn't appear on the supported processor list.

Per these guidelines, the following section shows whether the requirements are met for particular x64 processors that are associated with VM products in Azure.
