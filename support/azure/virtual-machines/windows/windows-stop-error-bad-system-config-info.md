## Cause

The **BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO** stop code occurs if the **SYSTEM** registry hive appears to be corrupted. This error can be caused by any of these reasons:

- The registry hive wasn't closed properly.
- The registry hive is corrupt.
- There are missing registry keys or values.

## Solution

### Process overview

> [!TIP]
> If you have a recent backup of the VM, you may try [restoring the VM from the backup](/azure/backup/backup-azure-arm-restore-vms) to fix the boot problem.

1. Fix the hive corruption.
1. Enable serial console and memory dump collection.
1. Rebuild the VM.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When encountering this error, the Guest operating system (OS) is not operational. You'll troubleshoot in offline mode to resolve this issue.

### Fix the hive corruption
