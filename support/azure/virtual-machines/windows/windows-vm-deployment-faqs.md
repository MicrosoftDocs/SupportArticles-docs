# Windows virtual machine deployment FAQs

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs

## How can I use and deploy a windows client image into Azure?

You can use Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 in Azure for dev/test scenarios if you have an appropriate Visual Studio (formerly MSDN) subscription. This [article](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images) outlines the eligibility requirements for running Windows client in Azure and uses of the Azure Gallery images.

## How can I deploy a virtual machine using the Hybrid Use Benefit (HUB)?

There are a couple of different ways to deploy Windows virtual machines with the Azure Hybrid Use Benefit.

For an Enterprise Agreement subscription:

* Deploy VMs from specific Marketplace images that are pre-configured with Azure Hybrid Use Benefit.

For Enterprise agreement:

* Upload a custom VM and deploy using a Resource Manager template or Azure PowerShell.

For more information, see the following resources:

* [Azure Hybrid Use Benefit overview](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/hybrid-use-benefit/)
* [Downloadable FAQ](https://download.microsoft.com/download/4/2/1/4211AC94-D607-4A45-B472-4B30EDF437DE/Windows_Server_Azure_Hybrid_Use_FAQ_EN_US.pdf)

## How do I activate my monthly credit for Visual studio Enterprise (BizSpark)

To activate your monthly  credit, see this [article](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0064p/).

## How to add Enterprise Dev/Test to my Enterprise Agreement (EA) to get access to Window client images?

The ability to create subscriptions based on the Enterprise Dev/Test offer is restricted to Account Owners who have been given permission to do so by an Enterprise Administrator. The Account Owner creates subscriptions via the Azure Account Portal, and then should add active Visual Studio subscribers as co-administrators. So that they can manage and use the resources needed for development and testing. For more information, see [Enterprise Dev/Test](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0148p/).

## My drivers are missing for my Windows N-Series VM

Instructions to install drivers for Windows-based VMs are located [here](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu#supported-operating-systems-and-drivers).

## I can't find a GPU instance within my N-Series VM

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs, you must install graphics drivers on each VM after deployment. Driver setup information is available [here](/azure/virtual-machines/sizes-gpu#supported-operating-systems-and-drivers).

## Are N-Series VMs available in my region?

You can check the availability from the [Products available by region table](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services), and pricing [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/series/#n-series).

## What client images can I use and deploy in Azure, and how to I get them?

You can use Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 in Azure for dev/test scenarios provided you have an appropriate Visual Studio (formerly MSDN) subscription.

* Windows 10 images are available from the Azure Gallery within [eligible dev/test offers](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images#eligible-offers).
* Visual Studio subscribers within any type of offer can also [adequately prepare and create](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/prepare-for-upload-vhd-image) a 64-bit Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 10 image and then [upload to Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/upload-generalized-managed). The use remains limited to dev/test by active Visual Studio subscribers.

This [article](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/client-images) outlines the eligibility requirements for running Windows client in Azure and use of the Azure Gallery images.

## I am not able to see VM Size family that I want when resizing my VM

When a VM is running, it is deployed to a physical server. The physical servers in Azure regions are grouped in clusters of common physical hardware. Resizing a VM that requires the VM to be moved to different hardware clusters is different depending on which deployment model was used to deploy the VM.

* VMs deployed in Classic deployment model, the cloud service deployment must be removed and redeployed to change the VMs to a size in another size family.

    [!INCLUDE [classic-vm-deprecation](../../../includes/azure/classic-vm-deprecation.md)]

* VMs deployed in Resource Manager deployment model, you must stop all VMs in the availability set before changing the size of any VM in the availability set.

## The listed VM size is not supported while deploying in Availability Set

Choose a size that is supported on the availability set's cluster. It is recommended when creating an availability set to choose the largest VM size you think you need, and have that be your first deployment to the Availability set.

## Where can I deploy Azure VMs?

You can deploy Azure VMs in any of the supported regions listed in [Choose the Right Azure Region for You](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies). If a region isn't listed, it may be present for redundancy requirements. For example, South Africa West is available as redundancy for South Africa North as a replication point.

## Additional information

If you encounter issues when you start a stopped Windows VM or resize an existing Windows VM in Azure, see [Troubleshoot Resource Manager deployment issues with restarting or resizing an existing Windows Virtual Machine in Azure](restart-resize-error-troubleshooting.md).
