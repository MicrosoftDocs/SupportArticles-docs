# Prerequisites for installing Internet Explorer 9

This article helps you resolve the problem that some prerequisites of Internet Explorer 9 can't be installed automatically.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Internet Explorer 9  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2399238

When you install Internet Explorer 9, additional software and components are also installed as part of the process. They are Internet Explorer 9 prerequisites. Their details vary, depending on the operating system that your computer is running. If some of these prerequisites can't be installed automatically, the Internet Explorer 9 installation process won't finish. In that case, you must manually install the prerequisite software and components that are described later in this article.

## Things to consider before you go the manual install route

### Make sure that no updates are being installed and that no restart is pending

Internet Explorer 9 might not automatically install prerequisite software and components if one of the following conditions is true:

- The installation of other updates is in progress.
- The system is awaiting a restart.

To check whether these things are causing the problem, do one of the following steps:

- In Windows 7, click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Windows Update.
- In Windows Vista, click Security in Control Panel, and then click Windows Update.

If an update installation is in progress, let the installation finish before you try to install Internet Explorer 9. If updates have been installed but the system hasn't yet been restarted, restart your computer before you try to install Internet Explorer 9.

Also note that if there's a restart pending, you may receive the following error message:

> The updates were not applicable.

### Make sure you're not running a prerelease version of Windows

If you're using a prerelease version of Windows, these updates won't install. And you'll receive the **updates were not applicable** error message. When you receive this error message, make sure that your computer is running a released, genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows Vista Service Pack 2 (SP2).

If you're not sure which version of Windows is installed, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start,** type *msinfo32* in the **Start Search** or **Search programs and files** box, and then press Enter.

## Manually install the Internet Explorer 9 prerequisites
