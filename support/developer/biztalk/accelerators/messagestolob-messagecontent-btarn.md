# Maintaining the MessagesToLOB and MessageContent Tables in BTARN

This article provides information about maintaining `MessagesToLOB` and `MessageContent` tables in Microsoft BizTalk Accelerator for RosettaNet (BTARN).

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; BizTalk Server 2013, 2010

## Summary

The scripts that are documented in the **Delete records in MessagesToLOB table** section and **Delete records in MessageContent table** section below, maintain the `MessagesToLOB` and `MessageContent` tables. The `MessagesToLOB` table grows as messages are processed. The private process routes incoming messages to the `MessagesToLOB` table in the BTARNDATA SQL Server database, in route to the LOB application. The same occurs with the `MessageContent` table. Whenever a send or receive pipeline processes a message, the pipeline creates a message activity. The pipeline creates a message-activity record in the `MessageContent` table. The record contains the content of the message, including both service content and headers.

> [!NOTE]
> - You must test the scripts thoroughly in your test environment before running them in a production environment. You can also create SQL Agent jobs to run them on a schedule basis.
> - See the BTARN product documentation for complete documentation on how BTARN processes a message. The full description is beyond the scope of this kb article.

## Delete records in MessagesToLOB table

To delete records in the `MessagesToLOB` table, you must modify the argument in the `DATEADD` function that is used in the `Delete` query. In the query below, the parameter `-7` means that the query will delete records that are older than seven months.

```sql
USE BTARNDATA
DELETE from [BTARNARCHIVE].[dbo].[MessagesToLOB] WHERE TimeCreated < DATEADD(mm,-7,GETDATE())
```

## Delete records in MessageContent table

To delete records in the `MessageContent` table, you must modify the parameter `@MonthValue`. In the query below, the value **-2** means that the query will delete records that are older than two months.

```sql
USE BTARNARCHIVE
declare @MonthValue as int
set @MonthValue = -2
DELETE from [BTARNARCHIVE].[dbo].[MessageContent]
WHERE ContentXml IS NOT NULL
AND CONVERT(DATETIME,SUBSTRING(ContentXml,
charindex('<DateTimeStamp>20',ContentXml)+15,8),101) < DATEADD(MM,@MonthValue,GETDATE())
```
