    For more information, see [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5 Release Notes](/previous-versions/bb986638(v=msdn.10)).

2. When the **Select An Installation Type** window appears, select **Custom**.
3. In the **Custom Installation** dialog box, expand **Microsoft Windows Core SDK**, and then expand **Tools**.
4. Select **Tools (Intel 64-bit)**, and then select **Will be installed on local hard drive**.
5. Select **Will not be available** on everything else, and then continue the installation.

## Enable the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility

To enable the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility, follow these steps:

2. Enter the following command:

    ``` console
    trace -tools "Path of the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility"
    ```

By default on Windows Server 2003, the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility is in the following directory:  
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Bin.

By default on Windows Server 2008, the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility is in the following directory:

You must enclose the path of the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility in quotation marks.

For example, enter the following command on Windows Server 2003:

``` console
trace -tools "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2\Bin"
```

On Windows Server 2008, enter the following command:

``` console
trace -tools "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0\Bin"
```

The `-tools` switch indicates to the location of the Tracelog.exe file to the *Trace.cmd* file.

### Run the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility

To run the BizTalk Adapter Trace Utility on a scenario, follow these steps:

1. At a command prompt, enter the following command:

    ``` console
    trace -start -all
    ```

2. Reproduce the scenario that you want to trace.

3. At a command prompt, enter the following command:

    ``` console
    trace -stop
    ```

After you stop the trace, a binary file for BizTalk Server 2006 and later versions that's named BtsTrace.bin is generated in the folder where BizTalk Server is installed. In BizTalk Server 2004, a binary file that's named Bts2004.bin is generated in the folder where BizTalk Server is installed.

You can send the BizTalk Server trace .bin file to Microsoft Customer Support Services for analysis.
