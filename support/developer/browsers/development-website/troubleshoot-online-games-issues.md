## More information

The most common cause is a missing or outdated add-on that's needed to play the game. Online games may be based on Silverlight, Flash, or Java and require Internet Explorer add-ons to function. Ensuring that you have the latest updates for Windows, Internet Explorer, and any Internet Explorer add-ons can help resolve many issues.

### Internet Explorer

If you're using **ActiveX Filtering** or **Tracking Protection** in Internet Explorer 9 or a later version, some content like games or videos might be disabled. To find out if you're using **ActiveX filtering** or **Tracking Protection**, see one of following articles:

### Microsoft Silverlight

For games that use Silverlight, make sure you're using the latest version of Silverlight and that Silverlight is enabled in Internet Explorer.

> [!NOTE]

### Java

For games that require Java add-ons, issues can be resolved by updating the add-ons to the latest version. The following troubleshooting steps may help to resolve the issue:

- Make sure you have the latest version of [Java](http://www.java.com/) installed.
- In some cases, it may be necessary to uninstall Java from your installed programs list and then reinstall the latest version.

### Adobe Flash

For games that require Adobe Flash add-ons, make sure you're using the latest version of Adobe Flash.

### Adobe Shockwave Player

> [!NOTE]
> Adobe Shockwave is no longer supported by Adobe. For more information, see [End of Life for Adobe Shockwave](https://helpx.adobe.com/shockwave/shockwave-end-of-life-faq.html).

1. Select **Programs** > **Manage add-ons**.
