Every update has an associated Knowledge base article (for example, [KB4586768](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4586768) â€“ Cumulative security update for Internet Explorer: November 10, 2020) associated with it.

It provides a link to the Microsoft Knowledge Base Article that's associated with the most recently installed update to Internet Explorer.

For example, if the first update for Internet Explorer 9 has been installed, the **About Internet Explorer** dialog box will have a link to **Update versions: 9.0.1 ([KB2530548](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2530548))**.

## How to determine the version of Internet Explorer for Windows

To determine the version of Internet Explorer, use any of the following methods:

- In all versions of Internet Explorer, select **About Internet Explorer** on the **Help** menu. The product and version information are displayed in the dialog box that appears.
- Use the registry. You can determine the version of Internet Explorer by viewing the following registry key:  
  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer`

  Refer to svcVersion value in this key. The version string value contains the version number of Internet Explorer that is installed on your computer. (For example, the version string value for Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 10 version 2004 is 11.630.19041.0). Only one zero is stored in the registry for the minor version number if the minor version number is 00. If the minor version number isn't 00, the full version value is stored.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The minor version number, build number, and subbuild number may be displayed without trailing zeros. For example, version 7.00.5730.1100 may be displayed as 7.0.5730.11.
> - The version numbers of Internet Explorer in the list are based on the versions of Windows. The list numbers might be changed by the latest hotfix.
> - Determine the version of Internet Explorer by using a script.

All versions of Internet Explorer send version information in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) user agent information header. This information can be read from script on a webpage.

Webpage developers can use this information to take advantage of new features in later versions of Internet Explorer, such as HTTP Strict Transport Security in Internet Explorer 11.0. They can also downgrade for earlier versions of Internet Explorer that don't support these features.
