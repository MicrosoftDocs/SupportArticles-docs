_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4013567

## More information

To disable Internet Explorer, use one of the following methods.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to restore the program on the same computer, we recommend that you use the same method that you first used (Control Panel or DISM). Because Internet Explorer remains installed on the computer after you disable it, you should continue to install security updates that apply to Internet Explorer.

## Method 1 - Use Control Panel (client systems only), Feature On Demand

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1703 and higher  

Using the Feature On Demand method is recommended for devices where it is available.

On client systems, you can use the **Program and Features** item in Control Panel to disable Internet Explorer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start** and open **Settings**.
1. Click **Apps**.
1. Click **Optional features**.
1. In the list of installed features, locate **Internet Explorer 11**. Click on the entry, then click **Uninstall**.
1. Wait for the Latest Actions section to indicate reboot required.
1. Restart the computer.

To enable Internet Explorer:

1. Click **Start** and open **Settings**.
1. Click **Apps**.
1. Click **Optional features**.
1. Click **Add a feature**.
1. Check the box next to **Internet Explorer 11**.
1. Click **Install (1)**.
1. Wait for the Latest Actions section to indicate reboot required.
1. Restart the computer.

## Method 2 - Use DISM (client and server systems), Feature On Demand

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1703 and higher  

Using the Feature On Demand method is recommended for devices where it is available.  

On client and server systems, you can use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool to disable Internet Explorer. For example, to disable Internet Explorer 11, follow these steps.

    [==========================100.0%==========================]
    The operation completed successfully.
    Restart Windows to complete this operation.
    Do you want to restart the computer now? (Y/N)
    ```

- Enable the feature

    If you want to re-enable Internet Explorer 11, run the following command at an elevated command prompt: `dism /online /Add-Capability /CapabilityName:Browser.InternetExplorer~~~~0.0.11.0`.

    The following message is returned:

    Image Version: 10.0.19041.985
    [==========================100.0%==========================]
    The operation completed successfully.
    Restart Windows to complete this operation.
    Do you want to restart the computer now? (Y/N)
    ```

1. Press the Windows logo key+R to open the **Run** box.
1. Type *appwiz.cpl*, and then select **OK**.
1. In the **Programs and Features** item, select **Turn Window features on or off**.

1. Select **OK** to commit the change.
1. Restart the computer.

## Method 4 - Use DISM (client and server systems), Windows Feature
