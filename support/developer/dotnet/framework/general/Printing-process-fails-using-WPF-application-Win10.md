# Printing a range of pages fails when you use a WPF application

This article discusses a problem in which the process of printing pages fails when you use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application.

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

1. You're using a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application in Windows 10 to print a range of pages.
1. You're running the `XpsDocument` object to process the print job by using `VisualsToXpsDocument`, `DocumentPaginator`, or another method.

In this scenario, the print process fails after printing some pages.

## Cause

When you print pages by using a WPF application on Windows 10, the font information is allocated on a page-by-page basis. If you're using this method to print a range of pages in a runtime, the process may increase memory usage by the operating system.

For example, if you're printing more than 8,000 pages, the process may stop because of a temporary increase in memory usage. This error indicates that an IOException occurred due to a failed access to the font file.

When all of the pages finish printing, memory can be freed for allocation.

## Workaround

For the documents that contain more than 1,000 pages, reduce the number of pages that you process to print job in a runtime.
