# Build may fail when you deploy the component with a property of type System.Text.Encoding to the form

This article helps you resolve a problem where the build fails when you deploy the component with a property of type `System.Text.Encoding` to the form.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; .NET Framework 4.5  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2956445

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Visual Studio development environment where .NET Framework 4.5 is installed, the build may fail when you deploy the component with a property of type `System.Text.Encoding` to the form.

It can occur when Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2012 is running in the environment with .NET Framework 4.5 installed.

It doesn't occur in the environment with .NET Framework 4.5.1 installed or when Visual Studio 2013 is running.

An example of the error message is:

> Invalid ResX file.Type in the data at line 138, position 5, cannot be loaded because it threw the following exception during construction: No data is available for encoding 932.

## Cause

It's because an error occurred during deserializing the property of type `System.Text.Encoding` from the resource file as objects in the build process.

When this error occurs, the build will fail because the object couldn't be loaded in the Windows form designer.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that it's a bug. This problem was corrected in .NET Framework 4.5 for Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.

        Encoding = Encoding.GetEncoding(932);
    }
    public Encoding Encoding { get; set; }
    ```
