# PreviewKeyDown event of TextBox control can't be triggered by Microsoft IME in WPF apps

> [!NOTE]
> The issue that is described in this article is a bug on Windows 10, version 2004/20H2/21H1/21H2 and it won't be fixed. But it has been fixed on Windows 11. So you can upgrade your system to Windows 11 to avoid the issue.

This article discusses an issue that prevents [PreviewKeyDown](/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.control.previewkeydown) events of TextBox controls from being triggered by some Microsoft  input method editors (IMEs) in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows 10, version 2004, Windows 10, version 20H2, Windows 10, version 21H1, Windows 10, version 21H2

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

1. You run a WPF application on Windows 10, version 2004/20H2/21H1/21H2.
1. You input in a TextBox control by using a Microsoft IME of East Asia.

In this scenario, the `PreviewKeyDown` event of the control isn't triggered. Therefore, some functions of the application that depend on the `PreviewKeyDown` event handlers don't work as expected.

## Cause

Microsoft IMEs are updated in some versions of Windows 10. This issue occurs when you use some of the latest Microsoft IMEs.

## Workaround

Turn on the **Compatibility** option to revert to the previous version of Microsoft IME. To do this, follow these steps:

1. In the search box on the taskbar, enter *language settings*, and then select **Language settings** in the list of results.

1. Select **Options** for your language.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cannot-trigger-event-in-wpf-with-ime/language-options.png" alt-text="Select language options." border="true":::

1. On the language option settings page, select **Options** for the IME that you're using.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/cannot-trigger-event-in-wpf-with-ime/ime-options.png" alt-text="Select IME options." border="true":::

1. Select **General**.

1. Turn on the **Use previous version of \<YourIME\>** option, and then select **OK** in the window that opens.
