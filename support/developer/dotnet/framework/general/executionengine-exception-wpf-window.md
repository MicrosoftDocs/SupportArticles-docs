# System.ExecutionEngineException occurs when displaying WPF window

This article helps you resolve the problem where attempting to instantiate another WPF Window results in an unhandled exception after closing one Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) Window.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio Professional 2010  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2691806

## Symptom

You have developed a Microsoft .NET 3.5 WPF component and hosting it in a non-WPF based client application, such as a Windows Forms application or native application. The client application calls into the WPF component to instantiate and display a custom WPF Window. The first instantiation of the Windows displays as expected. However, after closing the Window and attempting to instantiate another WPF Window results in an unhandled exception.

If running the application in the Visual Studio IDE, you receive following exception and call stack:

```console
System.ExecutionEngineException: Exception of type 'System.ExecutionEngineException' was thrown.

WindowsBase.dll!MS.Internal.Invariant.FailFast(string message, string detailMessage)
WindowsBase.dll!MS.Internal.Invariant.Assert(bool condition, string invariantMessage)
PresentationFramework.dll!System.Windows.Application.GetResourceOrContentPart(System.Uri uri)
PresentationFramework.dll!System.Windows.Application.LoadComponent(object component, System.Uri resourceLocator)
WPFClassLibrary.dll!WPFClassLibrary.WPFWindow.InitializeComponent()
WPFClassLibrary.dll!WPFClassLibrary.WPFWindow.WPFWindow()
WPFClassLibrary.dll!WPFClassLibrary.WPFManager.ShowWpfWindow()
WindowsFormsApplication1.exe!WindowsFormsApplication1.Form1.button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
```

If running the application under a native debugger, such as Windbg, you receive a breakpoint exception with the following call stack.

## Cause

The crash symptom occurs when the application calls into the `System.Windows.Application.LoadComponent` method to load a XAML file, associated with a WPF Window or UserControl. Eventually, the WPF run-time calls into `System.Windows.Application.GetResourceOrContentPart` to load resource packages associated with the current `System.Windows.Application` object.

This failure occurs because the resource packages associated with the current `System.Windows.Application` object could not be retrieved. This usually occurs because the current `System.Windows.Application` object has already been shut down, either by an explicit or implicit call to `Application.ShutDown`.

This behavior is by design.

## Resolution

When creating the instance of the `System.Windows.Application` object, set its `ShutDownMode` property to `ShutDownMode.OnExplicitShutdown`. This will only allow the `Application` object to be shut down as a result of custom code explicitly calling `Application.ShutDown`.

## More information

When the `Application.ShutDown` method is called, the WPF run-time unloads the resource packages associated with that `Application` object. At some point later, if the application does something that requires accessing the resources associated with the same `Application` object, the `System.Windows.Application.GetResourceOrContentPart` method attempts to load those resource packages, but is unable to because they were previously unloaded. When WPF detects this, it is considered a fatal condition and WPF purposely calls `System.Environment.FailFast`, which throws a `System.ExecutionEngineException` and terminates the process.

A client application is allowed to create one instance of an `System.Windows.Application` (or derived) type per AppDomain. The resources associated with that Application object are unloaded when the `Application.ShutDown` method is called. The `Application.ShutDown` method may be called explicitly by custom code, or it may be called internally by the WPF run-time based on the value of the `Application.ShutDownMode` property. By default, the `ShutDownMode` property of the `Application` object is set to `ShutDownMode.OnLastWindowClose`. This will cause the WPF run-time to shut down the `Application` object automatically after the last WPF window associated with that `Application` object has been closed. In a scenario where a client application has created an instance of a WPF `Application` object and displayed a Window and closed it, that window is deemed to be the last window closed, so WPF will automatically call `Application.ShutDown`.
