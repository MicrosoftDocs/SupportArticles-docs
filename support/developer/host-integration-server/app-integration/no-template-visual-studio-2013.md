# Host Integration Server 2013 doesn't work out-of-box with Visual Studio 2013

This article helps you resolve the problem where there's no Host Integration Server 2013 templates in Visual Studio 2013.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Host Integration Server 2013  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2970255

## Symptoms

After you install Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 on a computer that has Host Integration Server (HIS) 2013 installed, you don't see any Host Integration Server 2013 templates under the **Projects** node in the **Options** dialog box in Visual Studio.

## Cause

This problem occurs because Visual Studio 2013 doesn't include any Host Integration Server 2013 templates. By default, Host Integration Server 2013 works in a Visual Studio 2012 environment. Therefore, an out-of-box installation of Host Integration Server 2013 is incompatible with Visual Studio 2013.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, install [Cumulative update package 1 for Host Integration Server 2013](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2908834).
