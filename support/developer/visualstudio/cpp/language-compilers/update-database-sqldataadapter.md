# Update a SQL Server database by using the SqlDataAdapter object in Visual C++

This article introduces how to use the `SqlDataAdapter` object to update a SQL Server database in Microsoft Visual C++.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual C++  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 308510

## Summary

The `SqlDataAdapter` object serves as a bridge between an ADO.NET `DataSet` object and a SQL Server database. It is an intermediary object that you can use to do the following:

- Populate an ADO.NET `DataSet` with data retrieved from a SQL Server database.
- Update the database to reflect the changes (inserts, updates, deletes) made to the data by using the `DataSet`.This article provides Visual C++ .NET code samples to demonstrate how the `SqlDataAdapter` object can be used to update a SQL Server database with data modifications executed on a `DataSet` object that is populated with data from a table in the database.

This article refers to the .NET Framework Class Library namespace `System::Data::SqlClient`.

## SqlDataAdapter object and properties

The `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand` properties of the `SqlDataAdapter` object are used to update the database with the data modifications executed on a `DataSet` object. Each of these properties is `SqlCommand` objects that specify the respective `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` TSQL commands used to post the `DataSet` modifications to the target database. The `SqlCommand` objects assigned to these properties can be created manually in code, or can be automatically generated by using the `SqlCommandBuilder` object.

The first code sample in this article demonstrates how the `SqlCommandBuilder` object can be used to automatically generate the `UpdateCommand` property of the `SqlDataAdapter` object. The second sample uses a scenario in which automatic command generation cannot be used, and therefore demonstrates the process by which you can manually create and use a `SqlCommand` object as the `UpdateCommand` property of a `SqlDataAdapter` object.

## Create the sample SQL Server table

To create a sample SQL Server table to use in the Visual C++ .NET code samples documented in this article, follow these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Query Analyzer, and then connect to a database in which you want to create the sample table. The code samples in this article use the *Northwind* database that comes with SQL Server.

2. Execute the following T-SQL statements to create a sample table called *CustTest*, and then insert a record into it.

    ```sql
    Create Table CustTest
    (
        CustID int primary key,
        CustName varchar(20)
    )
    Insert into CustTest values(1,'John')
    ```

## Code sample 1: Automatically generated commands

If the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the data used to populate a `DataSet` is based on a single database table, you can take advantage of the `CommandBuilder` object to automatically generate the `DeleteCommand`, `InsertCommand`, and `UpdateCommand` properties of the `DataAdapter`. This simplifies and reduces the code required to perform `INSERT`, `UDPATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

As a minimum requirement, you must set the `SelectCommand` property for automatic command generation to work. The table schema retrieved by the `SelectCommand` determines the syntax of the automatically generated `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

The `SelectCommand` must also return at least one primary key or unique column. If none is present, an `InvalidOperation` exception is generated, and the commands are not generated.

To create a sample Visual C++ .NET console application that demonstrates how to use the `SqlCommandBuilder` object to automatically generate the `InsertCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, and `UpdateCommand` SqlCommand object properties for a `SqlDataAdapter` object, follow these steps:

1. Start Visual Studio .NET, and then create a new Managed C++ application. Name it *updateSQL*.
2. Copy and paste the following code in *updateSQL.cpp* (replacing its default contents):

    ```cpp
    #include "stdafx.h"

    #using < mscorlib.dll>
    #using < System.dll>
    #using < System.Data.dll>
    #using < System.Xml.dll>

    using namespace System;
    using namespace System::Data;
    using namespace System::Data::SqlClient;

    #ifdef _UNICODE
        int wmain(void)
    #else
        int main(void)
    #endif
    {
        SqlConnection *cn = new SqlConnection();
        DataSet *CustomersDataSet = new DataSet();
        SqlDataAdapter *da;
        SqlCommandBuilder *cmdBuilder;

        //Set the connection string of the SqlConnection object to connect
        //to the SQL Server database in which you created the sample
        //table in Section 1.0
        cn->ConnectionString = "Server=server;Database=northwind;UID=login;PWD=password;";
        cn->Open();

        //Initialize the SqlDataAdapter object by specifying a Select command
        //that retrieves data from the sample table
        da = new SqlDataAdapter("select * from CustTest order by CustId", cn);

        //Initialize the SqlCommandBuilder object to automatically generate and initialize
        //the UpdateCommand, InsertCommand and DeleteCommand properties of the SqlDataAdapter
        cmdBuilder = new SqlCommandBuilder(da);

        //Populate the DataSet by executing the Fill method of the SqlDataAdapter
        da->Fill(CustomersDataSet, "Customers");

        //Display the Update, Insert and Delete commands that were automatically generated
        //by the SqlCommandBuilder object
        Console::WriteLine("Update command Generated by the Command Builder : ");
        Console::WriteLine("==================================================");
        Console::WriteLine(cmdBuilder->GetUpdateCommand()->CommandText);
        Console::WriteLine(" ");
        Console::WriteLine("Insert command Generated by the Command Builder : ");
        Console::WriteLine("==================================================");
        Console::WriteLine(cmdBuilder->GetInsertCommand()->CommandText);
        Console::WriteLine(" ");
        Console::WriteLine("Delete command Generated by the Command Builder : ");
        Console::WriteLine("==================================================");
        Console::WriteLine(cmdBuilder->GetDeleteCommand()->CommandText);
        Console::WriteLine(" ");

        //Write out the value in the CustName field before updating the data using the DataSet
        DataRow *rowCust = CustomersDataSet->Tables->Item["Customers"]->Rows->Item[0];
        Console::WriteLine("Customer Name before Update : {0} ", rowCust->Item["CustName"]);

        //Modify the value of the CustName field
        String *newStrVal = new String("Jack");
        rowCust->set_Item("CustName", newStrVal);

        //Modify the value of the CustName field again
        String *newStrVal2 = new String("Jack2");
        rowCust->set_Item("CustName", newStrVal2);

        //Post the data modification to the database
        da->Update(CustomersDataSet, "Customers");

        Console::WriteLine("Customer Name after Update : {0} ", rowCust->Item["CustName"]);

        //Close the database connection
        cn->Close();

        //Pause
        Console::ReadLine();
        return 0;
    }
    ```

3. In the code you copied and pasted in step 2, modify the line of connect string code to properly connect to your SQL Server computer, as follows:

    ```cpp
    cn.ConnectionString = "Server=server;Database=northwind;UID=login;PWD=password;";
    ```

    After you run this code, you can connect with your SQL Server installation and then sign in.

4. Save and execute the application. A console window will open up and display the following output:

    ```console
    Update command generated by the Command Builder:
    ==================================================
    UPDATE CustTest SET CustID = @p1 , CustName = @p2 WHERE ( (CustID = @p3)
    AND ((CustName IS NULL AND @p4 IS NULL)
    OR (CustName = @p5)))
    Insert command generated by the Command Builder :
    ==================================================
    INSERT INTO CustTest( CustID , CustName ) VALUES ( @p1 , @p2 )
    Delete command generated by the Command Builder :
    ==================================================
    DELETE FROM CustTest WHERE ( (CustID = @p1)
    AND ((CustName IS NULL AND @p2 IS NULL)
    OR (CustName = @p3)))
    Customer Name before Update : John
    Customer Name after Update : Jack2
    ```

5. Press any key to dismiss the console window and stop the application.

## Code sample 2: Manually create and initialize the UpdateCommand property

The output generated by the code sample 1 indicates that the logic for generating commands automatically for `UPDATE` statements is based on *optimistic concurrency*. That is, records are not locked for editing and can be modified by other users or processes at any time. Because a record may have been modified after it was returned from the `SELECT` statement but before the `UPDATE` statement is issued, the automatically generated `UPDATE` statement contains a `WHERE` clause so that a row is updated only if it contains all original values and has not been deleted. This is done to ensure that new data is not overwritten. In cases where an automatically generated update attempts to update a row that has been deleted or does not contain the original values found in the `DataSet`, the command does not affect any records, and a `DBConcurrencyException` is thrown.

If you want the `UPDATE` to complete regardless of original values, you will need to explicitly set the `UpdateCommand` for the `DataAdapter` rather than rely on automatic command generation.

To manually create and initialize the `UpdateCommand` property of the `SqlDataAdapter` object used in the code sample 1, follow these steps:

1. Copy and paste the following code (overwriting the existing code) in the `Main()` function within the *UpdateSQL.cpp* file in the C++ application created in the code sample 1:

    ```cpp
    SqlConnection *cn = new SqlConnection();
    DataSet *CustomersDataSet = new DataSet();
    SqlDataAdapter *da;
    SqlCommand *DAUpdateCmd;
    cn->ConnectionString = "Server=server;Database=northwind;UID=login;PWD=password;";
    cn->Open();
    da = new SqlDataAdapter("select * from CustTest order by CustId", cn);

    //Initialize the SqlCommand object that will be used as the DataAdapter's UpdateCommand
    //Notice that the WHERE clause uses only the CustId field to locate the record to be updated
    DAUpdateCmd = new SqlCommand("Update CustTest set CustName = @pCustName where CustId = @pCustId"
    , da->SelectCommand->Connection);

    //Create and append the parameters for the Update command
    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Add(new SqlParameter("@pCustName", SqlDbType::VarChar));
    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Item["@pCustName"]->SourceVersion = DataRowVersion::Current;
    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Item["@pCustName"]->SourceColumn = "CustName";

    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Add(new SqlParameter("@pCustId", SqlDbType::Int));
    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Item["@pCustId"]->SourceVersion = DataRowVersion::Original;
    DAUpdateCmd->Parameters->Item["@pCustId"]->SourceColumn = "CustId";

    //Assign the SqlCommand to the UpdateCommand property of the SqlDataAdapter
    da->UpdateCommand = DAUpdateCmd;
    da->Fill(CustomersDataSet, "Customers");

    DataRow *rowCust = CustomersDataSet->Tables->Item["Customers"]->Rows->Item[0];
    Console::WriteLine("Customer Name before Update : {0} ", rowCust->Item["CustName"]);

    //Modify the value of the CustName field
    String *newStrVal = new String("Jack");
    rowCust->set_Item("CustName", newStrVal);

    //Modify the value of the CustName field again
    String *newStrVal2 = new String("Jack2");
    rowCust->set_Item("CustName", newStrVal2);

    da->Update(CustomersDataSet, "Customers");
    Console::WriteLine("Customer Name after Update : {0} ", rowCust->Item["CustName"]);
    cn->Close();
    Console::ReadLine();
    return 0;
    ```

2. Modify the line of connect string code in the preceding code sample as follows:

    ```cpp
    cn.ConnectionString = "Server=server;Database=northwind;UID=login;PWD=password;";
    ```

3. If you have already run the code in the [code sample 1](#code-sample-1-automatically-generated-commands) section of this article, open your *CustTest*table in SQL Server, and then change the *CustName* value in the first record back to *John*.

4. Save and execute the application. A console window will open up and display the following output:

    ```console
    Customer Name before Update : John
    Customer Name after Update : Jack2
    ```
