# The _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC macro doesn't work as expected

This article helps you resolve the problem that allocation is reported as occurring in the *Crtdbg.h* file when an object is allocated by the `new` operator and is dumped by the debugging routines in the C Run-Time Library.

## Symptoms

When an object is allocated through use of the `new` operator and dumped through use of the debugging routines in the C Run-Time Library, the allocation is reported as occurring in the *Crtdbg.h* file line 512.

## Cause

This is caused by the definition of the overloaded operator `new` in the *Crtdbg.h* file:

```cpp
#ifdef _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC
inline void* __cdecl operator new(unsigned int s)
    { return ::operator new(s, _NORMAL_BLOCK, __FILE__, __LINE__); }
#endif /* _CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC */
```

Here `__FILE__`and `__LINE__` are macros defined by the compiler that report the current file name and line number. Macros are filled out by the preprocessor. Then the compiler replaces your call to `new` with this function. Therefore, the macros have already been filled out before they are inlined. Hence they will report the header file information.

## Resolution

Defining the `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` symbol causes all instances of `new` in your code to be mapped properly to the debug version of `new` so as to record source file and line number information.

While it is true that this will map calls to the debug version of `new`, it will not store the proper source file or line number information. There are two ways to mark the correct file name and line number:

- Call the debug version of the `new` operator directly.
- Create macros that replace the operator `new` in debug mode as in the following sample code.

## Sample Code

```cpp
/* MyDbgNew.h
/* Defines global operator new to allocate from
/* client blocks*/
#ifdef _DEBUG
    #define MYDEBUG_NEW new( _NORMAL_BLOCK, __FILE__, __LINE__)
    // Replace _NORMAL_BLOCK with _CLIENT_BLOCK if you want the
    //allocations to be of _CLIENT_BLOCK type
#else
    #define MYDEBUG_NEW
#endif // _DEBUG
/* MyApp.cpp
/* Compile options needed: /Zi /D_DEBUG /MLd
/* or use a
/* Default Workspace for a Console Application to
/* build a Debug version*/
#include "crtdbg.h"
#include "mydbgnew.h"

#ifdef _DEBUG
    #define new MYDEBUG_NEW
#endif

void main( )
{
    char *p1;
    p1 = new char[40];
    _CrtMemDumpAllObjectsSince( NULL );
}
```
