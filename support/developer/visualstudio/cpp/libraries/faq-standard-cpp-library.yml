          What does Standard C++ library contain
        answer: |
          The Standard C++ library provides an extensible framework and contains components for language support, diagnostics, general utilities, strings, locales, standard template library (containers, iterators, algorithms, and numerics), and input/output.

          The Standard C++ library can be divided into the following categories:

          1. Standard Template Library (STL) components provide a C++ program with access to a subset of the most widely used algorithms and data structures. STL headers can be grouped into three major organizing concepts:

              - Containers: template classes that support common ways to organize data, such as `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `stack`, `queue`, `set`, and `map`.

              - Algorithms: template functions for performing common operations on sequences of objects, such as functional, algorithm, and numeric.

              - Iterators: the glue that pastes algorithms and containers together, such as utility, iterator, and memory.

          2. Input/Output includes components for forward declarations of `iostreams` (`iosfwd`), predefined `iostreams` objects (`iostream`), base `iostreams` classes (`ios`), stream buffering (`streambuf`), stream formatting and manipulators (`iosmanip`, `istream`, `ostream`), string streams (`sstream`), and file streams (`fstream`).

          3. Other Standard C++ headers include:

              - Language Support: components for common type definitions used throughout the library (`cstddef`), characteristics of the predefined types (`limits`, `cfloat`, `climits`), functions supporting start and termination of a C++ program (`cstdlib`), support for dynamic memory management (`new`), support for dynamic type identification (`typeinfo`), support for exception processing (`exception`), and other runtime support (`cstdarg`, `ctime`, `csetlmp`, `csignal`).

              - Diagnostics: components for reporting several kinds of exceptional conditions (`stdexcept`), documenting program assertions (`cassert`), and a global variable for error number codes (`cerrno`).

              - Strings: components for string classes (`string`) and null-terminated sequence utilities (`cctype`, `cwctype`, `cwchar`).

              - Localization: components that C++ programs may use to encapsulate cultural differences. The locale facility includes internationalization support for character classification and string collation, numeric, monetary, and date/time formatting and parsing, and message retrieval (`locale`, `clocale`).

      - question: |
          What is difference between CRT and Standard C++ library? What libraries will Runtime library compiler options include
        answer: |
          Visual C++ include the following libraries besides the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) libraries:

          - Basic C-Runtime library
          - Standard C++ library

          |Library types and related compiler switches|Basic C Runtime library / Standard C++ library|
          |---|---|
          |Single-threaded (/ML)|LIBC.LIB / LIBCP.LIB|
          |Debug Single-threaded (/MLd)|LIBCD.LIB / LIBCPD.LIB|
          |Multithreaded (/MT)|LIBCMT.LIB / LIBCPMT.LIB|
          |Debug Multithreaded (/MTd)|LIBCMTD.LIB / LIBCPMTD.LIB|
          |Multithreaded DLL (/MD)|MSVCRT.LIB / MSVCPRT.LIB|
          |Debug Multithreaded /DLL (`MDd`)|MSVCRTD.LIB / MSVCPRTD.LIB|
            
          > [!NOTE]
          >
          > - The **/ML** and **/MLd** library compiler options for statically single-threaded libraries have been removed in Visual C++.
          > - *MSVCPRT.lib* and *MSVCPRTD.lib* are static libraries and don't have any dynamic link libraries (DLLs) directly related to them. These libraries are also dependent on *MSVCRT.lib* and *MSVCRTD.lib*, respectively. If you have any applications that use *MSVCPRT.lib* or *MSVCPRTD.lib* and you use the **Ignore Default Library** (**/NOD** or **NODEFAULTLIB**) option, be sure to link *MSVCPRT.lib* (or *MSVCPRTD.lib*) and *MSVCRT.lib* (or *MSVCRTD.lib*) with your application. Otherwise, you will get linker errors (**LNK2001: unresolved externals in MSVCPRT.lib or MSVCPRTD.lib**) when linking your application. Depending on the headers you use in your code, a library from the Standard C++ library may also be linked.

          The header file *use_ansi.h* contains `#pragma` statements that force the Standard C++ library to be linked in. All Standard C++ headers include *use_ansi.h*: if you include any Standard C++ header in your application, the Standard C++ library will be linked by default.

      - question: |
          How to retain old `iostream` functionality from Visual C++ .NET 2003 or earlier versions if I port my project from an earlier version
        answer: |
          If you want to retain the old `iostream` library (*iostream.h*), include one or more of the old `iostream` header files in your code. Don't use the new Standard C++ headers. You can't mix calls to the old `iostream` library and the new Standard C++ library.

      - question: |
          How to make Standard C++ Libraries the default libraries for my application
        answer: |
          If you want to make the Standard C++ Libraries the default, include one or more of the new Standard C++ headers. You can't mix calls to the old `iostream` and the new Standard C++ library. Existing libraries (static or dynamic link) that use old `iostream` functions will have to be modified to use Standard C++ library `iostream` functions.

      - question: |
          If I use Standard C++ Libraries in MFC applications, will it cause conflicts with C-Runtime Libraries
        answer: |
          No. Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) doesn't use any C-Runtime functions that will conflict with the Standard C++ Libraries.

      - question: |
          Why I get error (error C2065: '`cout`' : undeclared identifier) even though I have included `iostream`
        answer: |
          Standard C++ library is implemented in its own namespace `std`. Make sure to add the following statement in the beginning of your program:

          ```cpp
          using namespace std;
          ```

           Or qualify each Standard C++ library identifier with namespace `std`, for example, `std::cout`.

      - question: |
          Why I get error (compiler error C2371: 'identifier' redefinition; different basic types)
        answer: |
          In versions of Visual C++ that are earlier than Visual C++ 2005, mixing Standard C++ headers and old `iostream` headers causes this error, even if they're included in different source files. The following are the different headers:

          - Old `iostream` headers:

              |Column 1|Column 2|
              |---|---|
              |FSTREAM.H|IOMANIP.H|
              |IOS.H|IOSTREAM.H|
              |ISTREAM.H|OSTREAM.H|
              |STDIOSTR.H|STREAMB.H|
              |STRSTREA.H||
                
          - Standard C++ headers:

              |Column 1|Column 2|Column 3|Column 4|
              |---|---|---|---|
              |ALGORITHM|BITSET|COMPLEX|DEQUE|
              |EXCEPTION|FSTREAM|FUNCTIONAL|IOMANIP|
              |IOS|IOSFWD|IOSTREAM|ISTREAM|
              |ITERATOR|LIMITS|LIST|LOCALE|
              |MAP|MEMORY|NUMERIC|OSTREAM|
              |QUEUE|SET|SSTREAM|STACK|
              |STDEXCEPT|STREAMBUF|STRING|STRSTREAM|
              |TYPEINFO|UTILITY|VALARRAY|VECTOR|

      - question: |
          Why I get message (LNK2001: unresolved external symbol 'symbol';) on `iostream` function calls when the project is built with Ignore Default Libraries
        answer: |
          The `iostream` functions have been removed from the C-Runtime library.

          If you're using the old `iostream` functions, you must add another library *LIBCI.lib* (single-threaded **ML**), *LIBCIMT.lib* (multithreaded **MT**), or *MSVCIRT.lib* (multithreaded dll **MD**). These libraries have been removed from Visual C++.

          If you're using the new `iostream` functions included with the Standard C++ library, you must add another library *LIBCP.lib* (single-threaded **ML**), *LIBCPMT.lib* (multithreaded **MT**), or *MSVCPRT.lib* (multithreaded dll **MD**).

          Don't mix different versions of the libraries. For example, if you're using the single-threaded version of the C-Runtime library, you must also use the single-threaded version of the old `iostream` library or Standard C++ library.

          You can't mix calls to the old `iostream` library functions and the new Standard C++ library `iostream` functions.

      - question: |
          Why do I get compiler warnings C4786 or C4788? None of the symbols in my program is anywhere near 255 characters in length
        answer: |
          C4786 or C4788 is issued when a symbol's name exceeds 255 characters in length. This issue often happens with template class, and `STL` uses template class extensively.

          Ignoring this warning is safe. Use a `#pragma` warning (disable: 4786,4788) to suppress the messages.

      - question: |
          Why I get message (C4530: C++ exception handler used, but unwind semantics aren't enabled. Specify -GX)
        answer: |
          Programs that use the Standard C++ library must be compiled with C++ exception handling enabled. C++ exception handling can be enabled by one of the following methods:

          - Selecting the **Enable exception handling** option in the **C++ Language Category of the C/C++** tab in the **Project Settings** dialog box.
          - Using the **/GX** compiler switch.

      - question: |
          Why I get compiler error C2146, followed by C2065, and finally C2143, all pointing to the same line in my source
        answer: |
          This sequence of errors can be caused by the following type of construct:

          ```cpp
          vector<int, allocator<int>>iV;
          ```

          The problem is caused by the consecutive `>>` at the end of the declaration. The solution is to put a space between two characters, so the construct becomes:

          ```cpp
          vector<int, allocator<int> > iV;
          ```

          It's consistent with the proposed ANSII specification.
