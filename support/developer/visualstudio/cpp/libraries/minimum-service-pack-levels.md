# Minimum service pack levels for Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

This article describes the minimum service pack level for Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 10  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2661358

## Summary

The Microsoft Download Center pages for Visual C++ Redistributable Packages don't consistently show the specific minimum service pack levels that are required for the target operating systems.

The following sections indicate the supported operating systems and service packs levels for each Visual C++ Redistributable Package. Each section also includes a link to the Download Center page for that package. Some Redistributable Packages were tested and published before newer Windows versions. So newer Windows versions might not be listed in the **Supported platforms** section on the download page. When a new Windows version is released, testing is done to ensure the compatibility between the Visual C++ Redistributable Package and Windows.

The support lifecycle for the Visual C++ Redistributable is tied to the lifecycles of both the corresponding Visual Studio version and the Windows platform on which it's used. If the Visual C++ Redistributable is installed by a product that's still in support, the redistributable is in support per the [Lifecycle FAQâ€”General Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/17140) for that product.

For more information about the support lifecycle for Visual Studio or Windows versions, see [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/hub/4095338).
