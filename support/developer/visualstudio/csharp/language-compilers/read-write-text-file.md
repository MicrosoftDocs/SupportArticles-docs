# Use Visual C# to read from and write to a text file

This article helps you read from and write to a text file by using Visual C#.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 816149

## Summary

The [Read a text file](#read-a-text-file) section of this article describes how to use the `StreamReader` class to read a text file. The [Write a text file (example 1)](#write-a-text-file-example-1) and the [Write a text file (example 2)](#write-a-text-file-example-2) sections describe how to use the `StreamWriter` class to write text to a file.

## Read a text file

The following code uses the `StreamReader` class to open, to read, and to close the text file. You can pass the path of a text file to the `StreamReader` constructor to open the file automatically. The `ReadLine` method reads each line of text, and increments the file pointer to the next line as it reads. When the `ReadLine` method reaches the end of the file, it returns a null reference. For more information, see [StreamReader Class](/dotnet/api/system.io.streamreader).

1. Create a sample text file in Notepad. Follow these steps:
    1. Paste the *hello world* text in Notepad.
    2. Save the file as *Sample.txt*.
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio.
3. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project**.
4. Select **Visual C# Projects** under **Project Types**, and then select **Console Application** under **Templates**.
5. Add the following code at the beginning of the *Class1.cs* file:

    ```csharp
    using System.IO;
    ```

6. Add the following code to the `Main` method:

    ```csharp
    String line;
    try
    {
        //Pass the file path and file name to the StreamReader constructor
        StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("C:\\Sample.txt");
        //Read the first line of text
        line = sr.ReadLine();
        //Continue to read until you reach end of file
        while (line != null)
        {
            //write the line to console window
            Console.WriteLine(line);
            //Read the next line
            line = sr.ReadLine();
        }
        //close the file
        sr.Close();
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + e.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Executing finally block.");
    }
    ```

7. On the **Debug** menu, select **Start** to compile and to run the application. Press ENTER to close the **Console** window. The **Console** window displays the contents of the *Sample.txt* fileï¼š

    ```console
    Hello world
    ```

## Write a text file (example 1)

The following code uses the `StreamWriter` class to open, to write, and to close the text file. In a similar way to the `StreamReader` class, you can pass the path of a text file to the `StreamWriter` constructor to open the file automatically. The `WriteLine` method writes a complete line of text to the text file.

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then select **Project**.
3. Select **Visual C# Projects** under **Project Types**, and then select **Console Application** under **Templates**.
4. Add the following code at the beginning of the *Class1.cs* file:

    ```csharp
    using System.IO;
    ```

5. Add the following code to the `Main` method:

    ```csharp
    try
    {
        //Pass the filepath and filename to the StreamWriter Constructor
        StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("C:\\Test.txt");
        //Write a line of text
        sw.WriteLine("Hello World!!");
        //Write a second line of text
        sw.WriteLine("From the StreamWriter class");
        //Close the file
        sw.Close();
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + e.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Executing finally block.");
    }
    ```

6. On the **Debug** menu, select **Start** to compile and to run the application. This code creates a file that is named *Test.txt* on drive C. Open *Test.txt* in a text editor such as Notepad. *Test.txt* contains two lines of text:

    ```console
    Hello World!!
    From the StreamWriter class
    ```

## Write a text file (example 2)

The following code uses the `StreamWriter` class to open, to write, and to close the text file. Unlike the previous example, this code passes two additional parameters to the constructor. The first parameter is the file path and the file name of the file. The second parameter, `true`, specifies that the file is opened in append mode. If you specify `false` for the second parameter, the contents of the file are overwritten each time you run the code. The third parameter specifies `Unicode`, so that `StreamWriter` encodes the file in Unicode format. You can also specify the following encoding methods for the third parameter:

- ASC11
- Unicode
- UTF7
- UTF8

The `Write` method is similar to the `WriteLine` method, except that the `Write` method doesn't automatically embed a carriage return or line feed (CR/LF) character combination. It's useful when you want to write one character at a time.

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.
3. Click **Visual C# Projects** under **Project Types**, and then click **Console Application** under **Templates**.
4. Add the following code at the beginning of the *Class1.cs* file:

    ```csharp
    using System.IO;
    using System.Text;
    ```

5. Add the following code to the `Main` method:

    ```csharp
    Int64 x;
    try
    {
        //Open the File
        StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("C:\\Test1.txt", true, Encoding.ASCII);

        //Write out the numbers 1 to 10 on the same line.
        for(x=0; x < 10; x++)
        {
        sw.Write(x);
        }

        //close the file
        sw.Close();
    }
    catch(Exception e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Exception: " + e.Message);
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Executing finally block.");
    }
    ```

6. On the **Debug** menu, select **Start** to compile and to run the application. This code creates a file that is named *Test1.txt* on drive C. Open *Test1.txt* in a text editor such as Notepad. *Test1.txt* contains a single line of text: *0123456789*.

    }
}

## Troubleshoot

For all file manipulations, it's good programming practice to wrap the code inside a `try-catch-finally` block to handle errors and exceptions. Specifically, you may want to release handles to the file in the final block so that the file isn't locked indefinitely. Some possible errors include a file that doesn't exist, or a file that is already in use.
