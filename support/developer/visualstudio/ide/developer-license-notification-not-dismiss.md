# You can't dismiss developer license notifications in Visual Studio 2013 Update 4

This update helps you resolve the problem where you can't dismiss developer license notifications in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 4.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio 2013  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3018885

## Symptoms

After you install Visual Studio 2013 Update 4, a critical notification in the Notification Hub indicates you must obtain or renew a developer license. If you dismiss this notice and then open another project, the critical notification appears again.

You may also receive one of the following Visual Studio critical notifications:

- Notification 1

    > Get a developer license. You need a developer license to develop Windows Store and Windows Phone apps. Click here to install a developer license. (Requires an internet connection.)

- Notification 2

    > Renew your developer license. The developer license on your machine expired on \<date>. Click here to renew your developer license now. (Requires an internet connection.)

> [!NOTE]
> In these notifications, internet is spelled all lowercase.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the process that detects whether a Windows Store Developer License is required incorrectly notifies users in certain cases, such as when you open a project that isn't a Windows Store or Windows Phone project.

## Resolution

An update to resolve this problem is available for manual download and installation from the Microsoft Download Center.
