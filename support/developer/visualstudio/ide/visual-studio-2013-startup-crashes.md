# Visual Studio 2013 crashes at startup because of CLR runtime settings

This article helps you resolve a problem where Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 crashes at startup because of common language runtime (CLR) runtime settings.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio 2013  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2979939

## Symptoms

This problem may occur after you make changes to the DevEnv.Exe.Config (or its express equivalent) file. The changes are unsupported and can introduce instabilities into Visual Studio. So you shouldn't make any changes to the configuration files unless directed by a Microsoft support engineer to do it.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, remove the entries that you changed from the configuration file. For example, you can remove the CLR setting entry `NetFx40_LegacySecurityPolicy` that is known to crash Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 in the configuration file.

You can find the configuration files (\<**App Id**>.exe.config) under the following folders:

- `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE`
- `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\12.0`
