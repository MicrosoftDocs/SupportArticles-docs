# Error - Product version that is being installed is old

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptoms

When you try to install Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, you receive the following error message:

> The product version that you are trying to set up is earlier than the version already installed on this computer.

## Resolution

If you determine that the new version is not earlier than the installed version, see [this MSDN post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/abaecb1a-2ed6-4c9d-9676-794039ba3422/visual-studio-community-2015-setup-blocked-the-product-version-that-you-are-trying-to-set-up-is?forum=vssetup) for guidance to resolve this issue.
