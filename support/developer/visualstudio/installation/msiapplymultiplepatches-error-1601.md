## Cause

If you try and apply greater than 85 patches by using `MsiApplyMultiplePatches`, it will result in the failure.

## Resolution

- Use multiple calls to `MsiApplyMultiplePatches` instead of one call with 85 or greater patches.
- Use minor update (service pack) to base line the product. A service pack will contain all updates up till that point in time. This reduces the number of patches that you would have to apply by using the `MsiApplyMultiplePatches` API.
