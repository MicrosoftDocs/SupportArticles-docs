# The Python development workload fails to install in Visual Studio

_Applies to:_&nbsp; Visual Studio 2022

## Symptoms

The Python development workload fails to install in Visual Studio. In addition, you see the following error message:

```output

Impacted components

```

## Cause

The Visual Studio Installer can't download the **python-3.9.13-amd64.exe** file from the URL `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2222466`.

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, ensure that the necessary domains and servers from which files are downloaded are added to the allowlist.

By adding the necessary domain URLs to the allowlist, you enable the Visual Studio Installer to download the required files and successfully install the Python development workload. For more information on the URLs to add to the allowlist and guidance on installing Visual Studio behind a firewall or proxy server, see [Install and use Visual Studio and Azure Services behind a firewall or proxy server](/visualstudio/install/install-and-use-visual-studio-behind-a-firewall-or-proxy-server).

Once you complete the allowlisting process, you can [install the Python development workload](/visualstudio/python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio#download-and-install-the-python-workload) in Visual Studio without encountering any download failures.
