# You sign in to the IDE, but it still tells you that the trial will expire

_Applies to:_&nbsp;Visual Studio 2015

## Symptom

You sign in to the IDE, but it still tells you that the trial will expire.

## Cause

You might have signed in with an account that doesn't have subscriber benefits (formerly called MSDN benefits) or a Visual Studio subscription.

## Resolution

When you sign in with an account as mentioned above, you should apply a product key, or the license should be issued automatically.
