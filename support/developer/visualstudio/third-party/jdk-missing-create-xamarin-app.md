# JDK is missing when you create a Xamarin-based app in Visual Studio 2015

This article helps you work around a problem where Java Development Kit (JDK) is missing when you create a Xamarin Android or Xamarin.Forms app in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Studio 2015  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4483429

## Symptoms

When you create a Xamarin Android or Xamarin.Forms app in Visual Studio 2015, you may receive an error message that resembles the following error:

> Xamarin.Android for Visual Studio requires Java Development Kit. Please install it or set Java Development Kit path on Tools->Options->Xamarin->Android Settings menu.

For example, you see an error message dialog box that's similar to the following screenshot:

## Cause

This issue occurs because Oracle no longer allows distribution of JDK in Visual Studio (as of January 2019).

## Workaround

To work around this issue, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest JDK 8 that's available from the [Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads webpage](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
2. Follow the instructions in the error message to manually point your Visual Studio instance to the location of your new JDK.
