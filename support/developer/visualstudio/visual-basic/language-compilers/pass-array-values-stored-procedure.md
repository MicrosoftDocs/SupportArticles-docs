# Pass array of values into SQL Server stored procedure using XML and Visual Basic .NET

This article shows how to pass array of values into SQL Server stored procedure using XML and Visual Basic .NET.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Basic  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 555266

## Symptoms

You are required to pass array of values into SQL Server stored procedure to use it as a list for an `IN` clause.

## CAUSE

Current version of Microsoft SQL Server does not have any support of array datatype that would allow passing array of values as a parameter of the stored procedure or SQL statement. Often developers are required to pass an array of the values to select records based on a provided list in an `IN` clause. In some cases list of the parameters passed to the stored procedure as a comma-delimited string and this delimited string cannot be used directly as a parameter of the IN clause and has to be transformed into the form that is acceptable for using inside of `IN` clause.

## Resolution

One of the solutions to this problem is to pass array of the values to the stored procedure as an XML string parameter and use `OPENXML rowset` provider inside of the stored procedure to select values from the provided XML. Using of the `OPENXML` provider in conjunction with the Transact-SQL statements provides flexible and simple way to manipulate data in a database based on a passed array of values.

## Create the project  

> [!NOTE]
> This sample does not contain code for the exception handling that would be required in a production-level application.

We will use Orders table from the `Northwind` SQL Server database. Use the following strong to create a stored procedure in a `Northwind` database.

```sql
IF EXISTS (SELECT name
    FROM sysobjects
    WHERE name = N'sp_SelectOrders'
    AND type = 'P')
    DROP PROCEDURE sp_SelectOrders
GO

CREATE PROC sp_SelectOrders @in_values nText AS

DECLARE @hDoc int

--Prepare input values as an XML documnet
exec sp_xml_preparedocument @hDoc OUTPUT, @in_values

--Select data from the table based on values in XML
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID IN (
 SELECT CustomerID FROM OPENXML (@hdoc, '/NewDataSet/Customers', 1)
 WITH (CustomerID NCHAR(5)))

EXEC sp_xml_removedocument @hDoc

GO
```

Start Visual Studio .NET and create Console Application. By-default *Module1.vb* file will be created.

Replace the strong inside of the *Module1.vb* file with the following one. To simplify and example, sample strong selects the list of all the customers from the Customers table, prepares array of values as an XML string just for half of the customers (to demonstrate limited selection) and then runs stored procedure to select list of the orders from the Orders table for the selected customers.

> [!NOTE]
> You would need to modify connection string in a sample strong to use it in your environment
