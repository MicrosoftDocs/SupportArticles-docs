# Start a process as another user from Visual Basic

This article describes how to redirect the input and the output of a child process that receives input from the standard input handle or that sends output to the standard output handle.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Visual Basic  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 285879

## Summary

This article shows you how to programmatically start a process as another user from Microsoft Visual Basic. To do this, you can use the `LogonUser` and `CreateProcessAsUser` Win32 APIs on a computer that is running Windows NT 4.0, or you can use the `CreateProcessWithLogonW` Win32 API on a computer that is running Windows 2000 or later. `CreateProcessWithLogonW` cannot be called from a process under the LocalSystem account.

## More information

This article contains sample Visual Basic code that detects the version of the operating system. It then uses the corresponding APIs to start a process as another user.

### Windows NT 4.0

- To use `LogonUser` and `CreateProcessAsUser`, the calling user account must have certain permissions.

- To use `LogonUser()`, the calling user account must have the following permission:

    Permission Display Name
    `SE_TCB_NAME` Act as part of the operating system

- To use `CreateProcessAsUser()`, the calling user account must have the following two permissions:

  Permission Display Name

  - `SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME` Replace a process level token
  - `SE_INCREASE_QUOTA_NAME` Increase quotas

If the calling user account does not have the permission to "act as part of the operating system," the `LogonUser()` API fails and generates a return value of zero. If you call `Err.LastDllError`, you receive error message 1314. This message means that a required permission is not held by the client. Similarly, if the calling user account does not have the two permissions to "replace a process level token" and to "increase quotas," the `CreateProcessAsUser()` API fails and generates the error message 1314.

If you start an interactive application as another user, you must have access to the interactive window station and desktop that is named *winsta0\default*. If the application is interactive, the caller needs to programmatically add the required permission to *winsta0\default*. After this, the caller can call the `RunAsUser` helper function in the sample Visual Basic code below.

You must give enough permissions to the user account that is specified in `LogonUser()` so that the interactive application can start successfully. The following Knowledge Base article has sample Visual Basic code that you can use to update permissions on a window station and desktop.

## Windows 2000 and Later

The `CreateProcessWithLogonW()` API was introduced in Windows 2000. A call to `CreateProcessWithLogonW()` does not require permissions to be granted for the calling user account, as it does with the LogonUser and `CreateProcessAsUser` APIs.

In the future, use the `CreateProcessWithLogonW()` API. It handles the permissions that are associated with the inherited window station and desktop. In this scenario, the application just calls the `RunAsUser` helper function in the following sample Visual Basic code.
