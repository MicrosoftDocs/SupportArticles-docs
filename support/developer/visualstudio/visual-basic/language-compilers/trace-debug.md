## Summary

This article demonstrates how to use the `Debug` and the `Trace` classes. These classes are available in the Microsoft .NET Framework. You can use these classes to provide information about the performance of an application either during application development or after deployment to production. These classes are only one part of the instrumentation features that are available in the .NET Framework.

### Requirements

The following list outlines the recommended hardware, software, network infrastructure, and service packs that you need:

- Windows
- Visual Basic .NET

This article also assumes that you are familiar with program debugging.

## Description of the technique

The steps in the [Create a sample with the Debug class](#create-a-sample-with-the-debug-class) section demonstrate how to create a console application that uses the `Debug` class to provide information about the program execution.

When the program runs, you can use methods of the `Debug` class to produce messages that help to monitor, to detect malfunctions, or to provide performance measurement information. By default, the messages that the `Debug` class produces appear in the Output window of the Microsoft Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

The sample code uses the `WriteLine` method to produce a message that is followed by a line terminator. When you use this method to produce a message, each message appears on a separate line in the Output window.

If you use the `Assert` method of the `Debug` class, the Output window displays a message only if a specified condition evaluates to false. The message also appears in a modal dialog box to the user. The dialog box includes the message, the project name, and the `Debug.Assert` statement number. The dialog box also includes three command buttons:

- **Abort**: The application stops running.
- **Retry**: The application enters debug mode.
- **Ignore**: The application proceeds. The user must click one of these buttons before the application can continue.

You can also direct output from the `Debug` class to destinations other than the Output window. The `Debug` class has a collection named `Listeners` that includes Listener objects. Each Listener object monitors
`Debug` output and directs the output to a specified target. Each Listener in the `Listeners` collection receives any output that the `Debug` class generates. Use the `TextWriterTraceListener` class to define Listener objects. You can specify the target for a `TextWriterTraceListener` class through its constructor. Some possible output targets include:

- The Console window by using the `System.Console.Out` property.
- A text file by using the `System.IO.File.CreateText("FileName.txt"))` statement.

After you create a `TextWriterTraceListener` object, you must add the object to the `Debug.Listeners` collection to receive `Debug` output.

## Create a sample with the Debug class

1. Use Visual Basic .NET to create a new Console Application project named *conInfo*. A public module named `Module1` is added to the project by default.
2. To initialize variables to contain information about a product, add the following `Dim` statements:

    ```vb
    Dim sProdName As String = "Widget"
    Dim iUnitQty As Integer = 100
    Dim dUnitCost As Decimal = 1.03
    ```

3. Specify the message that the class produces as the first input parameter of the `WriteLine` method. Press the CTRL+ALT+O key combination to ensure that the Output window is visible.

    ```vb
    Debug.WriteLine("Debug Information-Product Starting ")
    ```

4. For readability, use the `Indent` method to indent subsequent messages in the Output window:

    ```vb
    Debug.Indent()
    ```

5. To display the content of selected variables, use the `WriteLine` method as follows:

    ```vb
    Debug.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName)
    Debug.WriteLine("The available units on hand are " & iUnitQty)
    Debug.WriteLine("The per unit cost is " & dUnitCost)
    ```

6. You can also use the `WriteLine` method to display the namespace and the class name for an existent object. For example, the following code displays the `System.Xml.XmlDocument` namespace in the Output window:

    ```vb
    Dim oxml As New System.Xml.XmlDocument()
    Debug.WriteLine(oxml)
    ```

7. To organize the output, you can include a category as an optional, second input parameter of the `WriteLine` method. If you specify a category, the format of the Output window message is "category: message." For example, the first line of the following code displays "Field: The product name is Widget" in the Output window:

    ```vb
    Debug.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName, "Field")
    Debug.WriteLine("The units on hand are " & iUnitQty, "Field")
    Debug.WriteLine("The per unit cost is " & dUnitCost, "Field")
    Debug.WriteLine("Total Cost is" & iUnitQty * dUnitCost, "Calc")
    ```

8. The Output window can display messages only if a designated condition evaluates to true by using the `WriteLineIf` method of the `Debug` class. The condition to be evaluated is the first input parameter of the `WriteLineIf` method. The second parameter of `WriteLineIf` is the message that appears only if the condition in the first parameter evaluates to true.

    ```vb
    Debug.WriteLineIf(iUnitQty > 50, "This message WILL appear")
    Debug.WriteLineIf(iUnitQty < 50, "This message will NOT appear")
    ```

9. Use the Assert method of the `Debug` class so that the Output window displays the message only if a specified condition evaluates to false:

    ```vb
    Debug.Assert(dUnitCost > 1, "Message will NOT appear")
    Debug.Assert(dUnitCost < 1, "Message will appear")
    ```

10. Create the `TextWriterTraceListener` objects for the Console window (`tr1`) and for a text file named *Output.txt* (`tr2`), and then add each object to the `Debug` `Listeners` collection:

    ```vb
    Dim tr1 As New TextWriterTraceListener(System.Console.Out)
    Debug.Listeners.Add(tr1)

    Dim tr2 As New _
        TextWriterTraceListener(System.IO.File.CreateText("Output.txt"))
    Debug.Listeners.Add(tr2)
    ```

11. For readability, use the `Unindent` method to remove the indentation for subsequent messages that the `Debug` class generates. When you use the `Indent` and the `Unindent` methods together, the reader can distinguish the output as group.

    ```vb
    Debug.Unindent()
    Debug.WriteLine("Debug Information-Product Ending")
    ```

12. To ensure that each Listener object receives all of its output, call the `Flush` method for the `Debug` class buffers:

    ```vb
    Debug.Flush()
    ```

## Using the Trace class

You can also use the `Trace` class to produce messages that monitor the execution of an application. The `Trace` and `Debug` classes share most of the same methods to produce output, including:

- `WriteLine`
- `WriteLineIf`
- `Indent`
- `Unindent`
- `Assert`
- `Flush`

You can use the `Trace` and the `Debug` classes separately or together in the same application. In a Debug Solution Configuration project, both `Trace` and `Debug` output are active. The project generates output from both of these classes to all Listener objects. However, a Release Solution Configuration project only generates output from a `Trace` class. The Release Solution Configuration project ignores any `Debug` class method invocations.

```vb
Trace.WriteLine("Trace Information-Product Starting ")
Trace.Indent()

Trace.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName)
Trace.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName, "Field")
Trace.WriteLineIf(iUnitQty > 50, "This message WILL appear")
Trace.Assert(dUnitCost > 1, "Message will NOT appear")

Trace.Unindent()
Trace.WriteLine("Trace Information-Product Ending")
Trace.Flush()
Console.ReadLine()
```

## Verify that it works

1. Make sure that **Debug** is the current solution configuration.
2. If the Solution Explorer window is not visible, press the CTRL+ALT+L key combination to display this window.
3. Right-click *conInfo*, and then click **Properties**.
4. In the left pane of the *conInfo* property page, under the **Configuration** folder, make sure that the arrow points to Debugging.
5. Above the **Configuration** folder, in the Configuration drop-down list box, click **Active (Debug)** or **Debug**, and then click **OK**.
6. Press CTRL+ALT+O to display the Output window.
7. Press the F5 key to run the code. When the Assertion Failed dialog box appears, click **Ignore**.
8. In the Console window, press ENTER. The program should finish, and the Output window should display the following output:

    ```console
    Debug Information-Product Starting
        The product name is Widget
        The available units on hand are 100
        The per unit cost is 1.03
        System.Xml.XmlDocument
        Field: The product name is Widget
        Field: The units on hand are 100
        Field: The per unit cost is 1.03
        Calc: Total cost is 103
        This message WILL appear
        ---- DEBUG ASSERTION FAILED ----
    ---- Assert Short Message ----
    Message will appear
    ---- Assert Long Message ----

    at Module1.Main() C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My
    Documents\Visual Studio Projects\conInfo\Module1.vb(29)

        The product name is Widget
        The available units on hand are 100
        The per unit cost is 1.03
    Debug Information-Product Ending
    Trace Information-Product Starting
        The product name is Widget
        Field: The product name is Widget
        This message WILL appear
    Trace Information-Product Ending
    ```

9. The Console window and the Output.txt file should display the following output:

    ```console
    (The Output.txt file is located in the same directory as the conInfo
    executable, conInfo.exe. Normally this is the \bin folder of where the
    project source has been stored. By default that would be C:\Documents and
    Settings\User login\My Documents\Visual Studio Projects\conInfo\bin)
        The product name is Widget
        The available units on hand are 100
        The per unit cost is 1.03
    Debug Information-Product Ending
    Trace Information-Product Starting
        The product name is Widget
        Field: The product name is Widget
        This message WILL appear
    Trace Information-Product Ending
    ```

        Dim tr1 As New TextWriter`Trace`Listener(System.Console.Out)
        Debug.Listeners.Add(tr1)

        Dim tr2 As New _
            TextWriterTraceListener(System.IO.File.CreateText("Output.txt"))

        Debug.Listeners.Add(tr2)

        Debug.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName)
        Debug.WriteLine("The available units on hand are " & iUnitQty)
        Debug.WriteLine("The per unit cost is " & dUnitCost)

        Debug.Unindent()
        Debug.WriteLine("Debug Information-Product Ending")

        Debug.Flush()

        Trace.WriteLine("`Trace` Information-Product Starting ")

        Trace.Indent()

        Trace.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName)
        Trace.WriteLine("The product name is " & sProdName, "Field")
        Trace.WriteLineIf(iUnitQty > 50, "This message WILL appear")
        Trace.Assert(dUnitCost > 1, "Message will NOT appear")

        Trace.Unindent()
        Trace.WriteLine("Trace Information-Product Ending")

        Trace.Flush()

        Console.ReadLine()
    End Sub
End Module
```

## Troubleshooting

- If the solution configuration type is Release, the `Debug` class output is ignored.
- After you create a `TextWriterTraceListener` class for a particular target, `TextWriterTraceListener` receives output from the `Trace` and the `Debug` classes. This occurs regardless of whether you use the `Add` method of the `Trace` or the `Debug` class to add `TextWriterTraceListener` to the `Listeners` class.
- If you add a Listener object for the same target in the `Trace` and the `Debug` classes, each line of output is duplicated, regardless of whether `Debug` or `Trace` generates the output.

    ```vb
    Dim tr1 As New TextWriterTraceListener(System.Console.Out)
    Debug.Listeners.Add(tr1)
    Dim tr2 As New TextWriterTraceListener(System.Console.Out)
    Trace.Listeners.Add(tr2)
    ```
