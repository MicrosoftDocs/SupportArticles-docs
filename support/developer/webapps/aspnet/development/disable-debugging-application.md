# Disable debugging for ASP.NET applications

This article discusses how to disable debugging for ASP.NET applications running on .NET Framework.

## Summary

ASP.NET supports compiling applications in a special debug mode that helps developer troubleshooting. Debug mode causes ASP.NET to compile applications with extra information. The information enables a debugger to closely monitor and control the execution of an application. Applications that are compiled in debug mode execute as expected. However, the performance of the application is affected. To avoid the effect on performance, it's a good idea to enable debugging only when a developer is doing interactive troubleshooting.

Debugging is disabled by default. Debugging is frequently enabled to troubleshoot a problem. But it's frequently not disabled after the problem is resolved. This article describes how to disable debugging for an ASP.NET application.

To disable debugging, modify the **Web.config** file or the **Machine.config** file, as detailed in the following sections.

## Method 1: Modify the Web.config file

To disable debugging, add the compilation element to the **Web.config** file of the application by following these steps. The **Web.config** file is located in the application directory.

1. Open the **Web.config** file in a text editor, such as Notepad. The file is typically located in the application directory.
2. In the **Web.config** file, locate the compilation element. Debugging is enabled when the debug attribute in the compilation element is set to `true`.
3. Change the debug attribute to `false` to disable debugging for that application.

    The following code sample shows the compilation element with debug set to `false`:

    ```xml
    <compilation debug="false"/>
    ```

4. Save the **Web.config** file. The ASP.NET application automatically restarts.

## Method 2: Modify the Machine.config file

You can also disable debugging for all applications on a system by modifying the **Machine.config** file. To confirm that debugging isn't enabled in the **Machine.config** file, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Machine.config** file in a text editor, such as Notepad. The file is typically located in the following folder:  

   `%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\%VersionNumber%\CONFIG\`

   For 64-bit versions of the .NET Framework, the file is in the following folder:

   `%SystemRoot%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\%VersionNumber%\CONFIG\`

1. In the **Machine.config** file, locate the compilation element. Debugging is enabled when the debug attribute in the compilation element is set to `true`.
1. If the debug attribute is `true`, change the debug attribute to `false`.

   The following code sample shows the compilation element with debug set to `false`:

   ```xml
   <compilation debug="false"/>
   ```

1. Save the **Machine.config** file.

## Method 3: Using IIS Manager (if the web application is hosted on IIS)

1. Open IIS Manager on the computer where the website is hosted (you can select <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> and type **inetmgr**):

1. Select the website or web application for which you want to enable or disable debug mode from the left-hand side tree view:

   :::image type="content" source="media/disable-debugging-application/enable-disable-debug-mode-web-application.png" alt-text="Screenshot of website or web application for which you want to enable or disable debug mode.":::

1. From the middle pane of IIS Manager, select the **.NET Compilation** icon:

   :::image type="content" source="media/disable-debugging-application/net-compilation-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the .NET Compilation icon.":::

1. Within the list of parameter values displayed in the middle pane of IIS Manager, set the value of **Debug** under the **Behavior** category to:

   - **true**: Enable debug mode.
   - **false**: Disable debug mode.

1. Select the **Apply** button from the right-hand side pane of IIS Manager to save the changes to the IIS configuration:
