# You receive a System.IO.FileNotFoundException error when the client application calls a web service

This article helps you resolve the problem that `System.IO.FileNotFoundException` occurs when an ASP.NET Web application calls a web service.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; ASP.NET  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 823196

## Symptoms

When you call a web service in an ASP.NET web application, you may receive the following error:

> System.IO.FileNotFoundException

## Cause

You may receive the error if one of the following conditions is true:

- The worker process does not have permissions to read to the process Temp directory, and the worker process does not have permissions to write to the process Temp directory.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `XmlSerializer` class generates and compiles code on the fly to perform serialization and deserialization. `XmlSerializer` uses Code Document Object Model (CodeDom) to perform the compilation. CodeDom compilation uses temporary files on a disk. If the worker process doesn't have the read permissions on the Temp directory and the write permissions on the Temp directory, then all calls to the Web service fail. Therefore, the worker process requires the read permissions on the Temp directory and the write permissions on the Temp directory.
- There are compilation errors in the code that `XmlSerializer` generated.

## Resolution 1: Assign permissions to worker process account on the Temp directory

To resolve this problem, the ASP.NET worker process account (the ASPNET account or the NETWORK SERVICE account if your application is deployed on Internet Information Services (IIS) 6.0) must have read access and write access on the Temp directory.

> [!NOTE]
> If you use impersonation, the impersonated user must have full access on the Temp directory.

To assign required permissions to the worker process account on the Temp directory, follow these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the `%windir%\temp directory`.
2. Right-click `%windir%\temp`, and then select **Properties**.
3. In the **Properties** window, select the **Security** tab.
4. Select **Add**, type *ServerName\ASPNET*, and then select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace *ServerName* with the name of the web server.

    Replace *ASPNET* with *NETWORK SERVICE* if you deployed your application on IIS 6.0.
5. Under **Allow**, select the **Full Control** check box, and then select **OK**.

## Resolution 2: Find compiler errors in the code that XmlSerializer generated

To find errors that are generated by the compiler, you must add a switch to the *Web.config* file to keep compiler-generated files. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the *Web.config* file in a text editor, such as Notepad.
2. Add an `XmlSerialization.Compilation` switch to the `<system.diagnostics>` section of the code, as follows:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
        <system.diagnostics>
            <switches>
                <add name="XmlSerialization.Compilation" value="4"/>
            </switches>
        </system.diagnostics>
    </configuration>
    ```

3. Run the client application.

    The client application calls the web service.
4. Verify that the `%windir%\temp` directory has the *_tmpname.00.cs* file and the *_tmpname.out* file.

    The *_tmpname.00.cs* file is the generated source. The *_tmpname.out* file should have the compiler errors.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Enable the read permissions and enable the write permissions to the worker process account (*ASPNET* or *NETWORK SERVICE*) to write `%tmpname%` files in the Temp directory.

## Status

This behavior is by design.

## Steps to reproduce the behavior

The following sections provide information about steps to reproduce the behavior.

### Create a web service

1. Start Visual Studio .NET.
2. Create a new ASP.NET Web service project by using Visual C# .NET or Visual Basic .NET.

    By default, *Service1.asmx* is created.
3. Name the project *WebServiceTemp*.
4. In Solution Explorer, right-click *Service1.asmx*, and then select **View Code**.
5. In the *Service1.asmx.cs* file (or the *Service1.asmx.vb* file if you are using Visual Basic .NET), uncomment the default `HelloWorld()` web method.
6. On the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.

### Create a client web application

1. Create a new ASP.NET Web application by using Visual C# .NET or Visual Basic .NET.
2. Name the project *WebAppTemp*.
3. In Solution Explorer, right-click **References**, and then select **Add Web Reference**.
4. In the **Address** text box, type the following URL for **WebServiceTemp**:  
    `http://localhost/WebServiceTemp/Service1.asmx`
5. Select **Go**, and then select **Add Reference**.
6. Double-click WebForm1 to open the `Page_Load` event code.
7. Append the following code to the `Page_Load` event handler.

    - Visual C# .NET sample code

        ```csharp
        // Start an instance of the Web service client-side proxy.
        localhost.Service1 myProxy = new localhost.Service1();
        Response.Write( myProxy.HelloWorld());
        ```

    - Visual Basic .NET sample code

        ```vb
        'Start an instance of the Web service client-side proxy.
        Dim myProxy As localhost.Service1 = New localhost.Service1()
        Response.Write(myProxy.HelloWorld())
        ```

8. On the **Build** menu, select **Build Solution**.

## Set permissions on the Temp directory

To assign required permissions to the worker process account on the Temp directory, follow these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the `%windir%` directory.
2. Right-click `%windir%\temp`, and then select **Properties**.
3. On the **Properties** window, select the **Security** tab.
4. Select **Add**, type *ServerName\ASPNET*, and then select **OK**.
5. Make sure that the **Write** check box is not selected under **Allow**, and then select **OK**.
6. Run the web application.

    You may receive the error that is mentioned in the [Symptoms](#symptoms) section of this article.
