# Part 2.2 - Install Nginx and configure it as a reverse proxy server

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; .NET Core 2.1, .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5  

This article introduces how to install Nginx and configure it as a reverse proxy server.

## Prerequisites

To follow the exercises in this part, you must have one ASP.NET Core web application created and deployed to the */var* folder.

## Goal of this part

In the previous part, you created an ASP.NET Core web application by using the .NET CLI tool, and the application is deployed to the */var* folder. The application was also configured to listen on port 5000 for HTTP requests, and HTTPS redirection was removed.

At this point, the clients should provide the port number when you connect to the application (for example, `http://localhost:5000`). However, this isn't the desired behavior.

Our goals in this part are as follows:

- Clients should be able to navigate without having to provide a port number. For example, clients should connect by using `http://localhost`.
- The web application should start automatically if it stops for some reason or after the computer restarts.

In the next section, you'll use Nginx as a proxy server to route the HTTP requests that are made to port 80 to our .NET application instead. You'll also configure your application to start automatically.

## What is Nginx?

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is a popular, lightweight, and fast web server. It can run on both Linux and Windows, and it can be configured as a reverse proxy server.

## What is a daemon?

Nginx runs as a [daemon](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)). A daemon is an alternative term for a service that runs in the background. Just like the services that run on Windows, daemons can be configured to auto-start during startup. You'll configure your ASP.NET Core application to run as a daemon.

## Install Nginx by using APT

Installing Nginx is straightforward. Run the `sudo apt install nginx` command to install the program on the Ubuntu virtual machine.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/sudo-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of sudo command." border="true":::

After the installation finishes, run `whereis nginx` to discover where the program is installed. You can see where the Nginx configuration files are located by inspecting the output. The following screenshot shows that the configuration files are located in the */etc/nginx* folder.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/whereis-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of whereis command." border="true":::

> [!NOTE]
> If you run a distribution other than Ubuntu or Debian, you can find the equivalent package manager installation command or instructions from the [official Nginx installation documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/).

## Manage services by using systemctl

If you don't see that Nginx is running, you can start it explicitly by running `sudo systemctl start nginx`. Although this exercise will demonstrate the `systemctl` commands for Nginx, these commands are used to configure the web application to start automatically as a daemon.

After the installation finishes, Nginx is already configured to start automatically. Nginx runs as a daemon. You can check the status of the daemon by using [systemctl](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units).

The `systemctl` command is used to manage "services" for such tasks as showing the status of the service, or starting and stopping it. Some available parameters are start, stop, restart, enable, disable, and status. To check the status of Nginx, run `systemctl status nginx`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/systemctl-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of systemctl command." border="true":::

This command generates some useful information. As this screenshot shows, Nginx is in `active (running)` status, and the process ID of the Nginx instance is 8539. Also notice the `enabled` and `vendor preset: enabled` statements. `Enabled` means that this daemon will start when the machine is restarted, and `vendor preset: enabled` means that Nginx is enabled by default when it's installed. Therefore, Nginx will start automatically when the server is started.

## Test the Nginx installation

By default, Nginx listens on port 80. Because it's running, you should be able to access the main page of Nginx when you browse localhost. Use `curl` to test Nginx by running `curl localhost`. The yellow highlighted text in the following screenshot shows the Nginx default web page. Therefore, Nginx is running:

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/curl-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of curl command." border="true":::

## systemctl command options

Services, or daemons, can be managed by using the `systemctl` command. Starting, stopping, or making changes require superuser access. Therefore, you must add the `sudo` prefix to these commands.

### Restart daemons

You might have to restart the daemons from time to time. To restart a daemon, run `sudo systemctl restart <daemon_name>`. To restart Nginx, run `sudo systemctl restart nginx`. Make sure that you check the status of Nginx before and after you run this command to monitor changes to the process ID.

### Stop daemons

To stop a daemon, run `sudo systemctl stop <daemon_name>`. To stop Nginx, run `sudo systemctl stop nginx`, and then check the status of Nginx by running `systemctl status nginx` again. This time, the service is shown as inactive (dead) but still enabled. This means that although the service isn't running, it will start automatically after the server is restarted.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/stop-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of stop command." border="true":::

> [!NOTE]
> The `systemctl status` command also displays several lines of previous log entries for the daemon.

After you stop Nginx, run `curl localhost` again.

> [!NOTE]
> The connection is refused because nothing is listening for incoming traffic on port 80.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/localhost-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of BuggyAmb localhost." border="true":::

### Disable daemons

Disabling a daemon is different from stopping a daemon. A disabled daemon could be running, but it won't start automatically after the server is restarted. To disable the Nginx daemon, run `sudo systemctl disable nginx`, and then check the status of Nginx.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/disable-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of disable command." border="true":::

This screenshot shows that Nginx isn't running, and it's disabled. This means that Nginx won't start automatically after a restart.

### Start daemons

To start a daemon, run `sudo systemctl start <daemon_name>`. To start Nginx, run the `sudo systemctl start nginx`, and then check the status of the service again.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/start-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of start command." border="true":::

This screenshot shows that Nginx is started but is still disabled. Although the service is running, Nginx won't start automatically after a restart because it's a disabled service.

### Enable daemons

Enabling a service means that it will start automatically after a restart. To enable Nginx, run `sudo systemctl enable nginx`, and then check the status of Nginx again.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/enable-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of enable command." border="true":::

This screenshot shows that Nginx is running, and it will be started after the server is restarted.

## Configure Nginx as reverse proxy to route the requests to your ASP.NET Core application

Now that you've learned how to start, stop, and restart the Nginx service, you'll next configure Nginx as a reverse proxy to route the requests that are made on port 80 to your ASP.NET Core application that's listening on port 5000.

Here's the required configuration. Some of the key parts are highlighted.

```nginx
http {
  map $http_connection $connection_upgrade {
    "~*Upgrade" $http_connection;
    default keep-alive;
  }

  server {
    listen        80;
    server_name _;
    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection $connection_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration indicates the following:

- Nginx will listen on port 80 for all the requests (directive: `listen 80`).
- Nginx will route the requests to `http://localhost:5000` (directive: `proxy_pass http://localhost:5000`)

> [!NOTE]
> The `server_name _` line in the code. This is used as a catch-all directive. If you want to learn more about *server_name*, refer to the [official documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/server_names.html).

The configuration changes appear straightforward. We will use this code to replace the `server` directive section in the configuration file. But where is the configuration file?

### Find the correct Nginx configuration file

The primary Nginx configuration file is `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. To inspect the configuration, use the `cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` command, and search for the server directive.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/cat-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of cat command." border="true":::

Scroll through the configuration to locate the server directive. You should expect not to find it. We can put the desired configuration changes somewhere inside the configuration file. However, ideally, you wouldn't want to replace the original configuration file. This is to prevent introducing configuration errors that might prevent the server from starting correctly. The `server` section isn't in the main configuration file. If you keep scrolling through the configuration file, you'll discover that there are some `include` directives.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/include-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of include command." border="true":::

Include directives make it easier to manage the configuration by splitting it into chunks to be included in the main configuration file. The main configuration file can be kept simple, and some specific configuration parts can be moved to other files. The highlighted lines in this screenshot indicate the following:

- Nginx will load configuration from each *.conf* file that's located in the */etc/nginx/conf.d* directory.
- Nginx will load the configurations from each file that's located in the */etc/nginx/sites-enabled* directory.

If you inspect these directories, you won't find any configuration files in */etc/nginx/conf.d*. However, there is one file in */etc/nginx/sites-enabled*.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/conf-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of conf command." border="true":::

The default configuration file looks like a prime candidate to host the configuration that we're looking for. If you inspect the */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default* file by using `cat /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`, you would see that the default server directive is put within the following code.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/default-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of default information." border="true":::

Therefore, the */etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default* file will have to be edited to change the configuration.

### Edit the configuration file by using vi

You learned how to edit files when you edited the *Startup.cs* file to remove HTTPS redirection from the ASP.NET pipeline. Now, you'll use vi again to change the nginx configuration file.

> [!TIP]
> Always back up the files that you're changing. If something were to go wrong after editing, you can use that copy to restore the file to its previous state. In this case, run `cp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default ~/nginx-default-backup` to copy the configuration file to your home directory. The backup file name will be `nginx-default-backup`. Notice that the backup wasn't made in the same directory as the original file. This is because Nginx loads all the configuration files from that directory, and you don't want to break the configuration by loading two different versions of server directive.

Run `sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` to edit the configuration file and replace the server directive, as shown in the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/vi-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of vi command." border="true":::

Here are some tips and tricks for editing files by using vi:

- You can scroll up and down by using the arrow keys.
- To enter editing mode, press the **Insert** or **I** key. While you're in editing mode, there will be a **--INSERT--** message in the bottom-left corner.
- In editing mode, you can use the keyboard to delete characters one at a time.
- In editing mode, copy and paste operations work together with most of the terminals. So, you can copy the content from this article and paste it into vi.
- To exit editing mode, press **Esc**.
- You can delete lines more easily in normal mode. In normal mode, go to the beginning of a line that you want to delete, and enter *dd*. The `dd` command deletes the whole line. You can also type *5dd* to delete five lines at one time. However this option should be used with caution to avoid deleting extra content.
- [How to Delete Lines in Vim / Vi article](https://linuxize.com/post/vim-delete-line/) is a good one To learn how to delete multiple lines in vi.
- To exit vi and save the changes, enter *:wq!*, and then press **Enter**. Here, the colon (`:`) means that you're running a command, `w` means write the changes, `q` means quit, and `!` means override the changes.
- To exit without saving the changes, enter *:q!*, and then press **Enter**.

The changes are now saved, and you have to restart the Nginx service for these changes to take effect. Before you restart the service, you can run the `sudo nginx -t` command to test the configuration file. When this command runs, Nginx checks the configuration file syntax, and then it tries to open the files that are referenced in the configuration file.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/t-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of t command." border="true":::

As you can see here, the configuration file that was changed appears to be correct.

We have to restart Nginx so that the changes take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

After the restart, you expect to see a response from the ASP.NET Core application when you make a request to h`ttp://localhost` because Nginx should work as a reverse proxy for the requests that are made to port 80.

Restart the Nginx service for the changes to take effect, and then make a request to localhost by running `curl localhost`. However, this command will fail. The next step is to run `wget localhost`, and then search for some hints as to the source of the problem.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/wget-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of wget command." border="true":::

## Troubleshoot the Nginx proxy problem

In the previous screenshot, you see this information:

```output
Resolving localhost (localhost)... 127.0.0.1  
Connecting to localhost (localhost)|127.0.0.1|:80... connected.  
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 502 Bad Gateway  
2020-12-27 21:15:53 ERROR 502: Bad Gateway.
```

The first and second lines indicate that you're able to resolve localhost and connect on the `127.0.0.1:80` socket. Therefore, Nginx should be running. To verify this, you can run the `systemctl status nginx` command.

The third line indicates the source of the problem. You receive an **HTTP 502 Bad Gateway** error message. **HTTP 502 Bad Gateway** is related to proxies. It means that the reverse proxy could not connect to the back-end application. In this case, it's your ASP.NET Core web application that should be running and listening on port 5000 for the requests. We should check whether the web application is also running.

To start troubleshooting, run the same `netstat` command as before. This time, use the grep to filter your application's port 5000. Then, run `netstat -tlp | grep 5000`.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/netstat-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of netstat command." border="true":::

This sample output indicates that nothing is listening on port 5000. Therefore, this is the cause of the **HTTP 502** response that's coming from Nginx because it can't find a process that's listening on port 5000.

The solution is to start your ASP.NET Core application. However, before going further, you can review another approach for troubleshooting this problem. Not every problem is as easy to fix as simply looking at a few lines of log content and finding the root cause. Sometimes, you have to deep-dive into other system and application logs.

Because you work closely with Nginx when you set up ASP.NET Core applications in Linux, we suggest that you learn which kind of logs Nginx and the operating system provides for troubleshooting.

## Check the Nginx logs

If you run `cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf` again, and then look for the `logging settings`, you should notice the following.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/log-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of log information." border="true":::

This shows that Nginx has two kinds of logs: Access logs and Error logs. These are stored in the */var/log/nginx/* directory.

Access logs are similar to IIS log files. A quick inspection of the content reveals that they resemble the following screenshot.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/access-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of access command." border="true":::

Access logs don't show new information other than the HTTP 502 response status that you already knew. You can also inspect the error logs by running `cat /var/log/nginx/error.log`. These reveal lots more about the cause of the problem.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/error-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of error information." border="true":::

The indications are clear: Nginx can get the request from the client, but it can't connect to the `upstream` server at `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and to the ASP.NET Core application that should have been running and listening on that port.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, start your ASP.NET Core application manually. Connect to the server by using a second terminal session, and then run the ASP.NET Core application as before.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/aspnet-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot of aspnet information." border="true":::

While your ASP.NET Core application is running, switch to the other terminal session, and run the same `curl localhost` command. Now, you can access your ASP.NET Core application that running behind Nginx. The following screenshot shows that you made a request to localhost, the request was handled by Nginx and routed to the back-end application, and you received a response from your ASP.NET Core application.

:::image type="content" source="./media/2-2-install-nginx-configure-it-reverse-proxy/curllocalhost-command.png" alt-text="Screenshot of curllocalhost command." border="true":::

You have now configured Nginx to behave as a reverse proxy for your ASP.NET Core application that's running in Linux.

However, if the ASP.NET Core application doesn't start after a restart, what will be the result? What will occur if the web application crashes and doesn't start until you notice that it's not running? Should you start your ASP.NET Core application after every restart of process termination?
