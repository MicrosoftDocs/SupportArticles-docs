# XMLHttpRequest setRequestHeader method and Cookies

This article helps you resolve the problem when you use `XMLHttpRequest` `setRequestHeader` method and Cookies.

## Symptoms

When using the XML Document Object Model (DOM), the `setRequestHeader` method on the `XMLHttpRequest` object does not seem to set cookie headers as expected. The first call to `setRequestHeader` using the Cookie HTTP header seems to have no effect.

## Resolution

To add cookies to the request, the call to `setRequestHeader` for the Cookie header must be repeated because the first call is ignored:

```vbscript
'this value is ignored, but the step is necessary
xmlRequest.setRequestHeader "Cookie", "any non-empty string here"
'set all cookies here
xmlRequest.setRequestHeader "Cookie", "cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Setting cookies in this manner is atypical. Cookies are best set by the server using the `Set-Cookie` header.
