# Cookies added by a managed HttpModule aren't available to native IHttpModules or IHttpHandlers

This article helps you resolve the problem where cookies that are added by a managed isn't available to native `IHttpModules` or `IHttpHandlers`.

## Symptoms

When using the `Cookies` collection from either the managed `HttpRequest` or `HttpResponse` objects to add a cookie, the cookie doesn't show up in the native `IHttpRequest` object.

## Cause

The `Cookies` collection in the managed `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` objects don't have a corresponding collection in the `IHttpRequest` or `IHttpResponse` object in Internet Information Services (IIS). So adding or modifying either of these collections doesn't modify the `Cookie` header in the `IHttpRequest` object.

## Resolution

To modify a specific cookie in the `Cookie` header of the native `IHttpRequest` object from managed code, modify the `Cookie` header directly in the managed `HttpRequest` object's `Header` collection, instead of via the `Cookies` collection.

## More information

The following sample means managed `HttpModule` code would add the cookie to the headers in the `IHttpRequest` object in the IIS pipeline.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using System.Web;

namespace AddCookieModule
{
    public class AddCookieClass : IHttpModule
    {
        private void Application_BeginRequest(Object source EventArgs e)
        {
            HttpApplication application = (HttpApplication)source;
            HttpContext context = application.Context;
            HttpCookie testCookie = new HttpCookie("testCookie",
            DateTime.Now.ToString());
            testCookie.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddYears(5);
            context.Request.Headers.Add("Cookie",
                                        "testCookie=" + testCookie.Value);
            context.Response.Cookies.Add(testCookie);
        }

        public void Dispose()
        {
            // nothing to do.
        }

        public void Init(HttpApplication context)
        {
            context.BeginRequest +=
                (new EventHandler(this.Application_BeginRequest));
        }
    }
}
```
