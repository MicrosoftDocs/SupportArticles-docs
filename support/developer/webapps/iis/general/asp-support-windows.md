# Active Server Pages (ASP) support in Windows

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Active Server Pages  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2669020

Active Server Pages (ASP) enables web servers to dynamically generate webpages and create interactive web applications by using server-side scripting technology. The use of ASP pages with Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is currently supported in all supported versions of IIS.

IIS is included in Windows operating systems. Therefore, both ASP and IIS support lifetimes are tied to the support lifecycle of the host operating system.

For more information about the lifecycle policy of your operating system, see [Microsoft Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle).
