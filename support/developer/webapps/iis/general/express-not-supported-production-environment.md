## Summary

IIS Express enhances the ability to develop and test web applications on Windows by combining the power of IIS with the convenience of a lightweight web server like the ASP.NET Development Server. IIS Express is only used for development and testing purposes, and isn't supported for use in a production environment as a production web server.
