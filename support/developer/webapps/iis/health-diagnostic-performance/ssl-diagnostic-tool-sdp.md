## More information

If the user selects to collect an IIS ETW Log, the diagnostic will enable IIS ETW Trace named *IIS ETW SDP Trace*. The diagnostic will automatically stop this trace when the user is clicks **next** while the trace is running. If the user clicks **Cancel**, they should stop the trace with the following command from an Administrative command prompt:

```console
logman.exe stop "IIS ETW SDP Trace" -ets
```

In addition to the collected information that is listed in these tables, this troubleshooter can detect one or more of the following situations:

- IIS-related Services in a running state or not.
- Whether the site contains an SSL Binding or not.
- Whether HTTP.SYS is listening on the SSL Binding port or if the port is occupied by another executable.
- Whether the web site has a certificate assigned to the secure binding.
- Whether the web site is in a started state or not.
- If Active Directory client certificate authentication is enabled, and if the `DsMapperUsage` setting on the binding matches that of the site.
- If Active Directory client certificate authentication is enabled but on the web site, we don't require or accept the client certificates.
- Permissions on the machine keys folder.
- Whether the binding format specified in the web site bindings is correct or not.
- If Internet Protocol (IP) inclusion list is configured on the server, and if the IP address configured on the website binding isn't present in the IP inclusion list.

- Whether the type of certificate is correct or not (that is, Intended Purposes says Server Authentication).
- If the certificate is archived.
- If the certificate is missing the private key.
- Incorrect `Key-Spec` (that is, if the certificate has any other `KEYSPEC` defined other than `AT_EXCHANGE`).
- If the certificate has subject alternate name, an information message is shown.

- If the certificate has subject alternate name, then all the bindings of other web sites are checked to see if they match the binding and port combination or not and if they do, then we match whether the binding has the same certificate or not and that the host headers don't match.  
If the certificate has wildcard, an information message is shown.

- If the certificate has wildcard, then all the bindings of other web sites are checked to see if they match the binding and port combination or not and if they do, then we match whether the binding has the same certificate or not and that the host headers don't match.

- Whether the validation of the server certificate succeeds.
- Checks if the certificate is expired.
- Whether any of the SSL protocols are disabled on the server.
- Whether the order of cipher suites has been changed on the server.
- Check if any of the keys of the certificate have length less than 1024 bits.
- If MS12-006 is installed on the machine.
