# Authorization fails for requests to the default document in IIS 7.0 and later versions

This article helps you resolve the problem where authorization doesn't work for the requests to a default document in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 and later versions.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Internet Information Services 7.0 and later versions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2620604

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario. You have a web server running IIS 7.0 or a later version. The web server hosts an ASP.NET 4.0 web application that is configured to use forms authentication and a default document. You install the extensionless URL update described in the Microsoft knowledge base article KB980368 [A update is available that enables certain IIS 7.0 or IIS 7.5](https://support.microsoft.com/help/980368) onto the web server. After this update is installed, HTTP requests sent to the root of the web application will fail and users will be forced to re-authenticate, even though the default document is set to allow users via the `<authorization>` section of the IIS configuration file.

## Cause

In this scenario, the pertinent sections of the IIS configuration will look similar to the following:

```xml
<system.web>
    <authentication mode="Forms">
        <forms name="FormsCookie" defaultUrl="Home.aspx" loginUrl="Login.aspx" path="/" />
    </authentication>
    <authorization>
        <deny users="?" />
        <allow users="*" />
    </authorization>
</system.web>
<location path="Default.aspx">
    <system.web>
        <authorization>
            <allow users="*" />
        </authorization>
    </system.web>
</location>
```

Before the extensionless URL update in KB980368 is installed, when a request is sent to the root of the site the IIS static file handler will act first and redirect the request to the configured default document. For example, if the default document is set to *default.aspx* and the site name is `http://www.contoso.com`, sending a request to `http://www.contoso.com` will automatically send the user to `http://www.contoso.com/default.aspx`. Next, ASP.NET will come in to play due to the .aspx extension of the request URL and will serve *default.aspx* to the user in accordance with the authorization setting in the `<location>` tag section of the configuration file.

After the extensionless URL update in KB980368 is installed, the ASP.NET extensionless URL handler will act first for the request to `http://www.contoso.com`. ASP.NET determines that the URL requires authentication, so the user is redirected to the forms authentication login page before the IIS static file handler gets a chance to request the default document.

## Workaround

If your web application does not require the extensionless URL feature, then the wildcard handlers can safely be removed from the application configuration. In the IIS Manager, under the **Handler Mappings** section for the application, remove the following handlers:

- `ExtensionlessUrl-Integrated-4.0`
- `ExtensionlessUrl-ISAPI-4.0_32bit`
- `ExtensionlessUrl-ISAPI-4.0_64bit`
