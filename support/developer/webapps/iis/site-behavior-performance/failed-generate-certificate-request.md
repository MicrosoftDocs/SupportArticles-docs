## Symptoms

When you try to create a certificate request in IIS, you may receive an error message that is similar to the following one:  

> Failed to generate the certificate request. Access is denied.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the administrator who tries to create the certificate request doesn't have Full Control permissions on the files and the sub folders in the following folder:  
`\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys`

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, grant the administrator account Full Control on all files and sub folders in the `MachineKeys` folder. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. Select **Start**, select **Run**, type `\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\`, and then select **OK**.
2. Right-click **MachineKeys**, and then select **Properties**.
3. On the **Security** tab, select **Administrator** or select the administrator group account you want, select the check box to enable Full Control permissions, and then select **OK**.
