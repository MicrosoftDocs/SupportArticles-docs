# Troubleshoot 4xx and 5xx HTTP errors

This article provides troubleshooting steps for resolving [4xx](#identify-4xx-errors) and [5xx](#identify-5xx-errors) HTTP status code errors in Internet Information Services (IIS). 4*xx* status codes indicate an issue on the client side, while 5*xx* status codes indicate an issue on the server side. The guidance will help you identify the cause of these errors and resolve them effectively.

## Identify 4xx errors

The 4*xx* HTTP status codes indicate that an error occurred due to a client-side issue. For example, the client browser might have requested a page that doesn't exist, or the client browser might not have provided valid authentication information.

To identify 4*xx* errors, examine the [IIS logs](#examine-the-iis-logs) and the [HTTPERR logs](#examine-the-httperr-logs):

- The HTTP status code is recorded in the IIS logs. This file is usually stored in **C:\inetpub\logs\Logfiles** but can be configured via IIS **Logging** in IIS Manager.
- A 4*xx* error code can be generated by the **HTTP.sys** kernel driver, which means these requests might not reach IIS and thus won't be logged in IIS logs. **HTTP.sys** logs these errors in separate files called [HTTPERR logs](/windows/win32/http/error-logging-in-the-http-server-api). This file is usually stored in **C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\HTTPERR** but can be configured via the registry `HKEY\LOCAL\MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters\ErrorLoggingDir`.
- One way to confirm if the 4*xx* response is coming from **HTTP.sys** is to collect a HAR trace file on the client and look for the response header **Microsoft-HttpApi/2.0**.

  To capture a HAR trace file, which records your browser's interaction with the website, follow the instructions in [Capture a browser trace for troubleshooting](/azure/azure-portal/capture-browser-trace#microsoft-edge).

### Examine the IIS logs

If you find errors in the IIS logs, note the status code (`sc-status`) and substatus code (`sc-substatus`) and see [HTTP status code overview](../health-diagnostic-performance/http-status-code.md#4xx---client-error) for more information.

To get more information on the status code and understand which module or handler returned [4xx](../health-diagnostic-performance/http-status-code.md#4xx---client-error) errors, collect [Failed Request Trace (FREB) logs](#steps-to-capture-freb-logs) around the time the issue occurred by configuring a FREB rule to be triggered by the status code seen in the IIS logs.

### Examine the HTTPERR logs

If you find errors in the HTTPERR logs, note the reason (`s-reason`) and see [Types of Errors Logged by the HTTP Server API](/windows/win32/http/types-of-errors-logged-by-the-http-server-api) for more information.

## Identify 5xx errors

The 5*xx* HTTP status codes indicate that the server couldn't complete the request because the server encountered an error when processing the request. Use the following instructions based on your application type.

### 500 errors in classic ASP

If a 500 error occurs in classic ASP, check the error code or error message in the `cs-uri-query` query of the IIS logs.

For more information, capture and examine [Failed Request Trace (FREB) logs](#steps-to-capture-freb-logs) for the 500 errors.

### 500 errors in general IIS

If a 500 error occurs in general IIS, examine the IIS logs, note the status code (`sc-status`) and substatus code (`sc-substatus`) and see [HTTP status code overview](../health-diagnostic-performance/http-status-code.md#5xx---server-error) for more information on the failure. 

Enable detailed error messages if feasible to get more details. To enable detailed error messages, follow these steps:

1. Open the **Run** command window.
1. Launch **inetmgr**.
1. In IIS Manager, under the **Connections** pane located on the left side of the console, expand the machine name, expand **Sites**, and then select the target website.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/iis-connection-site-target-website.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the target website in IIS Manager.":::

1. Double-click the **Error Pages** icon in the middle pane.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/error-pages-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Error Pages icon.":::

1. On the right, in the **Actions** pane, select **Edit Feature Settings**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/edit-feature-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit Feature Settings option.":::

1. In the **Edit Error Pages Settings** dialog (where you choose to send both local and remote requests), the second option button is what you need to select to return detailed errors for both local and remote requests. By default, the bottom option is selected to send detailed errors only sent for local requests.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/edit-error-pages-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Edit Error Pages Settings dialog.":::

   We don't recommend sending detailed errors for remote requests since this option might expose sensitive information to the Internet. You need to revert the changes once you have more information on the failure.

For more information, capture and examine [Failed Request Trace (FREB) logs](#steps-to-capture-freb-logs) for the 500 errors.

### 500 errors in ASP.NET

If a 500 error occurs in ASP.NET, use the following methods to identify the root cause of the error:

- Check the Application Event Logs.

  Check the Application Event Logs around the time the issue occurred. ASP.NET will log the details of the error, including the call stack, in the Application Event Logs.

  [!INCLUDE [Access the Application Event Logs](../../../../includes/access-application-event-logs.md)]

- Capture memory dumps.

  In some cases, it might be necessary to capture a memory dump of a specific exception to examine the details surrounding the exception that caused the 500 HTTP status.

  To capture dumps, follow the instructions in [Collect memory dumps for a first-chance exception when it occurs](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/iis-support-blog/collect-memory-dumps-for-a-first-chance-exception-when-it-occurs/ba-p/2276128).

  Use the DebugDiag 2 Analysis tool (part of the [DebugDiag](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58210&msockid=145197b7d1fa6877376482b2d0bf6961) suite) with the **CrashHangAnalysis** rule on the collected dumps to generate a report that can be used to review the call stack and identify the root cause.

  To generate a report using the DebugDiag Analysis tool, follow these steps:

  1. Open DebugDiag 2 Analysis.
  1. Select **Add Data Files** and add the **.dmp** file(s).
  1. Select **CrashHangAnalysis** and **PerfAnalysis** and select **Start Analysis**.

  When finished, a report (**.mht**) will be created in **C:\Program Files\DebugDiag\Reports** and displayed in Internet Explorer with the results and recommendations.

  If using custom DLLs, you can specify the Symbol Search Path for the custom PDB files by following these steps:

  1. Open the DebugDiag 2 Collection tool.
  1. Select **Tools** > **Options And Settings** > **Folders And Search Paths**.
  1. Under **Symbol Search Path For Debugging**, select **Browse** to set the path.

- Capture Perfview trace to identify ExecutionTimeout issues.

  For 500 errors due to exceeding the ASP.NET ExecutionTimeout, [capture a PerfView trace and dumps](#steps-to-capture-a-perfview-trace-and-dumps) to identify any delays.

### 500 errors in ASP.NET Core

If a 500 error occurs in ASP.NET Core, use the following methods to identify the root cause of the error:

- Check the Application Event Logs.

  [!INCLUDE [Access the Application Event Logs](../../../../includes/access-application-event-logs.md)]

- Enable the [Developer Exception Page](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#developer-exception-page).

  The `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable can be added to **web.config** to run the application in the development environment. If you don't override the environment setting in your application's startup code using the `UseEnvironment` method on the host builder, the environment variable allows the [Developer Exception Page](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/error-handling#developer-exception-page) to appear when the application is run.

  ```xml
  <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet"
      arguments=".\MyApp.dll"
      stdoutLogEnabled="false"
      stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout"
      hostingModel="InProcess">
    <environmentVariables>
       <environmentVariable name="ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" value="Development" />
    </environmentVariables>
  </aspNetCore>
  ```

  Setting the environment variable for `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is only recommended on staging and test servers not exposed to the Internet. Remove the environment variable from the **web.config** file after troubleshooting.

- Enable the ASP.NET Core Module `stdout` log.

  To enable and view `stdout` logs, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to the site's deployment folder on the hosting system.
  1. If the **logs** folder isn't present, create the folder. For instructions on how to enable MSBuild to create the **logs** folder in the deployment automatically, see [ASP.NET Core directory structure](/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/directory-structure).
  1. Edit the **web.config** file. Set `stdoutLogEnabled` to `true` and change the `stdoutLogFile` path to point to the **logs** folder (for example, **.\logs\stdout**) like the following one:

     ```xml
     <aspNetCore processPath="dotnet"
         arguments=".\App.dll"
         stdoutLogEnabled="true"
         stdoutLogFile=".\logs\stdout">
     </aspNetCore>
     ```

  1. Use `stdout` as the file name prefix. A timestamp, process ID (PID), and file extension are added automatically when the log is created. A typical log file name is **stdout\_<timestamp\>\_<PID\>.log**.
  1. Ensure your application pool's identity has write permissions to the **logs** folder.
  1. Save the updated **web.config** file.
  1. Make a request to the application.
  1. Navigate to the **logs** folder. Find and open the most recent `stdout` log.
  1. Investigate the errors in the log.

  To disable `stdout` logging when troubleshooting is complete, follow these steps:

  1. Edit the **web.config** file.
  1. Set `stdoutLogEnabled` to `false`.
  1. Save the file.

- Enable the ASP.NET Core Module debug log (IIS).

  To enable the ASP.NET Core Module debug log, add the following handler settings to the application's **web.config** file:

  ```xml
  <aspNetCore ...>
     <handlerSettings>
       <handlerSetting name="debugLevel" value="file" />
       <handlerSetting name="debugFile" value="c:\temp\ancm.log" />
     </handlerSettings>
  </aspNetCore>
  ```

  Confirm that the path specified for the log exists and that the application pool's identity has write permissions to the location.

### 502 errors in ARR

If a 502 error occurs in Application Request Routing (ARR), follow the instructions in [Troubleshooting 502 errors in ARR](../application-request-routing/troubleshooting-502-errors-in-arr.md).

### 503 errors

If you encounter 503 errors, the substatus code (`sc-substatus`) in the [IIS logs](#examine-the-iis-logs) or `s-reason` in the [HTTPERR logs](#examine-the-httperr-logs) can provide some hints.

For more information, see:

- [503 - Service unavailable](../health-diagnostic-performance/http-status-code.md#503---service-unavailable)
- [Error Logging in the HTTP Server API](/windows/win32/http/error-logging-in-the-http-server-api#kinds-of-errors-that-the-http-api-logs)

Also, refer to the following article, which highlights a known issue that can cause 503 errors:

[HTTP response 503 Service Unavailable from IIS: one common generic cause](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/iis-support-blog/http-response-503-service-unavailable-from-iis-one-common/ba-p/1720007)

### Steps to capture a PerfView trace and dumps

To capture a PerfView trace and dumps, follow the steps in the following sections.

#### Configure PerfView and Procdump before the issue

Before the issue occurs, follow these steps to configure PerfView and Procdump for data collection:

1. Download [Procdump](/sysinternals/downloads/procdump). It's a lightweight executable file that doesn't require installation and automates dump collection.
1. Extract the **procdump.exe** file to a particular folder on the server.
1. Download the [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview/releases) tool on the server. It's a profiler tool that captures Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events (no installation required).
1. For PerfView to provide useful information, add **Tracing** as a **Role Service** for IIS. Without **Tracing** enabled, an ETW trace will only include **HTTP.sys** information. If you aren't sure whether the **Tracing** role service is installed, follow these steps:

   [!INCLUDE [Install the Tracing role service](../../../../includes/enable-tracing-role.md)]

1. Open the PerfView tool, select the **Collect** menu, and select the **Collect** option.
1. Select the **Zip**, **Merge**, and **Thread Time** checkboxes, as shown in the following screenshot. Modify the **Circular MB** field to **2000**:

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/zip-merge-thread-time.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Zip, Merge, and Thread Time.":::

1. Expand the **Advanced Options** tab and select the **IIS** checkbox, as shown in the following screenshot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/collecting-data-over-user-specified-interval.png" alt-text="Screenshot of collecting data over a user-specified interval.":::

   If you're running an ASP.NET Core application, add the following string in the **Additional Providers**:

   `*Microsoft-Extensions-Logging:4:5,Microsoft-AspNetCore-Server-Kestrel,System.Net.Http,System.Net.Sockets,System.Net.NameResolution,System.Threading.Tasks.TplEventSource::5,Microsoft-System-Net-Http,Microsoft-Windows-Application Server-Applications::Verbose`

   > [!NOTE]
   > Don't miss the asterisk (`*`) at the beginning.

#### Collect data during the issue

During the time of the issue, follow these steps to collect data:

1. Select the **Start Collection** button in PerfView with the configuration settings you set up in the [Configure PerfView and Procdump before the issue](#configure-perfview-and-procdump-before-the-issue) section.
1. Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager.
1. Select your server name (on the left).
1. Double-click **Worker Processes** to see the **Process Id** of the services. For example:

   :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-http-error-code/worker-processes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Worker Processes in IIS Manager.":::

1. Open **Command Prompt** as an administrator.
1. Navigate to the folder where **procdump.exe** is extracted by running `cd <path to procdump.exe>` in the **Command Prompt** window.
1. Run the following command to capture consecutive dumps.

   `procdump.exe -accepteula -ma <PID of W3WP.exe)> -s 10 -n 3`

   > [!NOTE]
   > Replace `<PID of W3WP.exe>` with the actual PID of the **W3WP.exe** process you found in step 4.

   - You can specify a path at the end of the command to store the dumps in a specific location.
   - This command will capture three sets of dumps at 10-second intervals.

1. Once the dumps are collected by procdump, stop PerfView by selecting **Stop collection**, or wait two and a half minutes for it to stop automatically. Allow PerfView to merge the collected data, which might take some time. And it will generate a **Perfview.etl.zip** file. If you're prompt for symbols, select **Use Microsoft Symbol Servers**.
