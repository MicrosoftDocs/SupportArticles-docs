This article describes how to recover a private key after you use the Certificates Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in to delete the original certificate in Internet Information Services (IIS).

## Summary

You delete the original certificate from the personal folder in the local computer's certificate store. This article assumes that you have the matching certificate file backed up as a PKCS#7 file, a .cer file, or a .crt file. When you delete a certificate on a computer that's running IIS, the private key isn't deleted.

## Assign the existing private key to a new certificate

To assign the existing private key to a new certificate, you must use the Windows Server version of Certutil.exe. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the computer that issued the certificate request by using an account that has administrative permissions.
2. Select **Start**, select **Run**, type *mmc*, and then select **OK**.
3. On the **File** menu, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
4. In the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, select **Add**.
5. Select **Certificates**, and then select **Add**.
6. In the **Certificates snap-in** dialog box, select **Computer account**, and then select **Next**.
7. In the **Select Computer** dialog box, select **Local computer: (the computer this console is running on)**, and then select **Finish**.
8. Select **Close**, and then select **OK**.
9. In the Certificates snap-in, expand **Certificates**, right-click the **Personal** folder, point to **All Tasks**, and then select **Import**.
10. On the **Welcome to the Certificate Import Wizard** page, select **Next**.
11. On the **File to Import** page, select **Browse**.
12. In the **Open** dialog box, select the new certificate, select **Open**, and then select **Next**.
13. On the **Certificate Store** page, select **Place all certificates in the following store**, and then select **Browse**.
14. In the **Select Certificate Store** dialog box, select **Personal**, select **OK**, select **Next**, and then select **Finish**.
15. In the Certificates snap-in, double-click the imported certificate that is in the **Personal** folder.
16. In the **Certificate** dialog box, select the **Details** tab.
17. Select **Serial Number** in the **Field** column of the **Details** tab, highlight the serial number, and then write down the serial number.
18. Select **Start**, select **Run**, type **cmd**, and then select **OK**.
19. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    certutil -repairstore my "SerialNumber"
    ```

    *SerialNumber* is the serial number that you wrote down in step 17.
20. In the Certificates snap-in, right-click **Certificates**, and then select **Refresh**.

The certificate now has an associated private key.

You can now use the IIS MMC to assign the recovered keyset (certificate) to the web site that you want.
