# Troubleshoot device date is causing connectivity issues

## Prerequisites

Login to Business Central.

## Symptoms

You might experience connect issues when trying to sign in to the Business Central Universal app. The Business Central Universal app only runs with HTTPS. 

## Resolution

Check if your device has the correct date set; this date is validated against the certificate. For more information, see [Using HTTPS and Certificates](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-using-https-and-certificates-mobile-app).
