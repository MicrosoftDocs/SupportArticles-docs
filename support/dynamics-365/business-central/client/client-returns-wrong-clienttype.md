# A Business Central client returns a wrong client type

This article provides a resolution for the issue that you might get the same [ClientType](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/clienttype/clienttype-option) when you run the Business Central tablet client and the Business Central phone client simultaneously in the same browser session.

## Symptoms

Running the Business Client tablet client and the Business Client phone client simultaneously in the same browser session will return the same [ClientType](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/clienttype/clienttype-option).

## Prerequisites

First you must check that the environment meets the prerequisites for the mobile app. For more information, see [Preparing the environment](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/deployment/install-business-central-app#prereqs).

## Resolution

If you have implemented code that checks for the [CurrentClientType](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/methods-auto/session/session-currentclienttype-method), you must run each client in a separate browser window to make sure that the correct client type is returned.
