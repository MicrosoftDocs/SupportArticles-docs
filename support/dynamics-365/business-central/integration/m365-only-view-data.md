# "You can only view data in Microsoft Teams" error in Business Central

This article helps you resolve the error "you can only view data in Microsoft Teams" that occurs when you share a link in Microsoft Teams with a user who has a Microsoft 365 license in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## Symptoms

When you [share a link](/dynamics365/business-central/across-working-with-teams#share-a-link) in Microsoft Teams as a Business Central user, certain users might receive the following error message:

> When accessing Business Central with a Microsoft 365 license, you can only view data in Microsoft Teams.

## Cause

When a user shares a Business Central link to a Microsoft Teams chat or channel, navigating the link will always navigate out of Microsoft Teams where a user with a Microsoft 365 license can no longer access the data.
