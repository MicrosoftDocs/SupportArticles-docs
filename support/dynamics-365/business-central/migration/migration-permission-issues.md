# Permission issues in Business Central cloud migration

This article solves permission errors that you might encounter when trying to [set up cloud migration](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migration-setup) in Business Central.

## Symptoms

When a user runs the [Cloud Migration Setup assisted setup guide](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migration-setup), one of the following error messages appears:

> - Operation on target NotifyBusinessCentral failed: Invoking Web Activity failed with HttpStatusCode - '500': A user setting up Cloud Migration does not have enough permissions: either not a Delegated Admin, or a Delegated Admin without a customer consent.

> - You do not have permission to create or run scheduled tasks.

## Cause

The user running the cloud migration setup has insufficient permissions.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> To solve this issue, you need administrator permissions in Business Central.

- Make sure the user running the setup is assigned the [SUPER permission](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/administration-special-permission-sets) set in Business Central online.
- If the user running the setup is a [delegated administrator](/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/administration/migration-setup#about-delegated-administrators), make sure the customer has consented.
