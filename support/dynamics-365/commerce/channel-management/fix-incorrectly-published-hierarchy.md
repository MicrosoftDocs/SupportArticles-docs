# A hierarchy is incorrectly published to a future date

This article resolves an issue where a hierarchy change is incorrectly published to a future date in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Symptoms

After a user makes changes to an [organization's hierarchy](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/organizations-organizational-hierarchies) and publishes the hierarchy, the **date** field is incorrectly set to a future date. This issue prevents the system from replicating data to the channel database. As a result, the products, pricing, and other items don't appear in the [channel](/dynamics365/commerce/channels-overview).

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps to delete the incorrectly dated hierarchy. Once the incorrect hierarchy is deleted, re-create your changes to the hierarchy and ensure you publish it to the correct date.

1. In the navigation pane, go to **Modules** > **Organization administration** > **Organizations** > **Organization hierarchies**.
2. Select the hierarchy that you want to delete.
3. Select **View**.
4. On the right side of the screen, select **Related information**.
5. Under **Future changes**, select **More**.
