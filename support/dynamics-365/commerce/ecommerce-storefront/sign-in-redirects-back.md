# Sign-in link redirects back to an e-commerce site

This article provides a resolution for an issue where a sign-in link redirects back to the e-commerce site instead of going to the sign-in page in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Symptoms

After you configure a new [Microsoft Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)](/dynamics365/commerce/set-up-b2c-tenant) tenant in Commerce site builder, users who select the **Sign in** link are redirected back to the main e-commerce landing page without going to the sign-in page.

## Resolution

To solve this issue, follow these steps to confirm that the reply URL is correctly configured in the Azure AD B2C application:

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Select the Azure AD B2C application that you created for your site access.
1. Select the application that you created during the Azure AD B2C setup.
1. Under **Reply URL**, make sure that the list includes entries for both the site domain URL and the e-commerce-generated URL, as shown in the following example.

> [!NOTE]
> Both the site domain URL and the e-commerce-generated URL must be in a valid URL format that doesn't include leading or trailing slashes.
