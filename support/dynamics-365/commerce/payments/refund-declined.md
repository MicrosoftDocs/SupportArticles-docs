# Refund on a return order is declined

This article provides a resolution for an issue where a refund on a return order is declined because the credit card that's used for invoicing differs from the card that was used during the original payment authorization in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Symptoms

A refund is declined when the credit card that's used to invoice a return order differs from the card that was used during the original payment authorization. You receive the following error message:

> Some payments are not in the correct status for posting. Please re-validate the status of all payments prior to invoicing.
