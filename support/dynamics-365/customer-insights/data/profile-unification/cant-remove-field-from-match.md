# Can't update or remove a field from matching rules

I can't update or remove a field from matching rules due to dependencies.

## Symptoms

When trying to update or remove a field in the Matching rules step of data unification, I receive a message that I can't perform this action due to dependencies.

## Resolution

[Remove a field that has been unified](/dynamics365/customer-insights/data/data-unification-update#remove-a-unified-field) or [remove a table that has been unified](/dynamics365/customer-insights/data/data-unification-update#remove-a-unified-table)
