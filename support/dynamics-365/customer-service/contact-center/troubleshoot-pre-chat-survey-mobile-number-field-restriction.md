# Troubleshoot pre-chat survey mobile number field restriction

This article provides guidance on the behavior of the mobile number field in a pre-chat survey, explains the cause of the issue, and offers potential solutions.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have access to the pre-chat survey configuration settings within your Microsoft Dynamics environment. Familiarity with Dynamics 365 Customer Service or related tools may be helpful.

## Potential quick workarounds

### Workaround: Submit a feature request

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/).
2. Create a new idea submission requesting the implementation of numeric-only restrictions for the mobile number field.

## Troubleshooting checklist

### Verify field behavior

1. Test the mobile number field in the pre-chat survey by entering various types of input (e.g., numeric, alphanumeric, special characters).
2. Confirm that the field is accepting alphanumeric input, which aligns with the current design.

## Cause: The behavior is by design

The mobile number field in the pre-chat survey currently allows alphanumeric input. This design does not enforce restrictions to numeric values only.

### Solution: Submit feedback for potential enhancement

1. Visit the [Microsoft Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/).
2. Provide details about your use case and the need for numeric-only restrictions in the mobile number field.
3. Engage with the community by voting for similar ideas or discussing your suggestion.

## Advanced troubleshooting and data collection

If numeric-only restrictions are critical for your business operations, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support to explore alternative configurations or custom development options that may address your requirement. Collect the following details before contacting support:

1. Description of the issue, including the current behavior and expected behavior.
2. Screenshots or recordings of the mobile number field behavior in the pre-chat survey.
3. Environment details, such as Dynamics 365 version and any customizations applied.
