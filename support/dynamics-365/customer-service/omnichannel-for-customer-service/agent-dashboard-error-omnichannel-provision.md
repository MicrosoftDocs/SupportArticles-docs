# An authentication error occurs on the agent dashboard after Omnichannel for Customer Service is provisioned

This article provides a resolution for the issue where the agent dashboard displays an authentication error after you provision Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Symptoms

The following error message is displayed on the agent dashboard after provisioning Omnichannel for Customer Service:

> Something went wrong while authenticatingâ€”please try again. If this continues, have your administrator contact Microsoft Support with the client session ID.

## Cause

The issue occurs when you rename the org URL but don't update the channel URL after you've provisioned Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue,

1. Go to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com).
2. On the left pane, select **Apps**, and then from the applications list, select **Omnichannel for Customer Service**.
3. Select the ellipsis (**...**) button, scroll down the list, and select **App profile manager**.
4. Select an admin app, like Customer Service admin center, and then select **Channel provider**. The **Active Channel Providers** list is displayed.
5. Do the following steps:

   1. Make sure that the omnichannel channel provider record is listed and is in the active state. If the omnichannel record isn't active, select the record and then select **Activate** on the menu bar.
   2. On the **General** tab of the omnichannel record, make sure that the **Channel URL** field includes the org information as shown in the following example:
