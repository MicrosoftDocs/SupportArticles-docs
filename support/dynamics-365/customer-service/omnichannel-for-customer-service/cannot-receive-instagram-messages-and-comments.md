# Can't receive Instagram messages and comments in a customer service application

This article explains why Instagram messages and comments, along with Facebook comments, might not appear in a customer service application despite proper setup and permissions. It provides information on the current limitations of Dynamics 365 Customer Service applications and alternative solutions.

## Symptoms

You might encounter the following issues:

- Instagram messages and comments aren't displayed in the customer service application.
- Facebook comments are also not visible despite proper account linking and permissions setup.

## Cause

Instagram isn't currently supported as a default social channel for chat in Dynamics 365 Customer Service applications.

Microsoft is aware of the demand for Instagram integration in Dynamics 365 Customer Service applications. An idea has been submitted to investigate this as a potential feature for future updates. For more details or to track progress, visit the [idea submission page](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/idea/?ideaid=9d2da859-15b3-eb11-89ee-0003ff45921e).

## Alternative solution: Configure a custom messaging channel

To enable Instagram as a social channel for customer service interactions, users can create a custom messaging channel. Follow the steps outlined in [Configure custom messaging channels](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/configure-custom-channel) to set up a custom channel for Instagram messaging and comments.
