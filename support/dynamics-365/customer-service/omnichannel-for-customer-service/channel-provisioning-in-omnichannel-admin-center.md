# Can't provision channels in Omnichannel Admin Center

This article provides guidance for resolving provisioning issues when the Omnichannel Admin Center application appears in read-only view.

## Symptoms

When you try to provision a channel in the Omnichannel Admin Center, you encounter the following issues:

- The Omnichannel Admin Center appears in read-only view.
- You can't manage or provision channels through the Omnichannel Admin center.

## Cause

The Omnichannel Admin center has been deprecated. All functionalities previously available in the Omnichannel Admin center have been integrated into the Customer Service admin center.

To successfully provision the chat (or other) channels, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your environment.
2. Open the **Customer Service admin center** application.
3. Go to **Channels** under **Customer Support**.
4. Select **Manage** to configure the channels.
5. Check the appropriate boxes to provision the channels that you want to use.
