# Chat channel provisioning fails in Dynamics 365 due to license issue

This article provides guidance to resolve the issue where the chat channel provisioning fails in Dynamics 365 Customer Service due to a license issue.

## Symptoms

When you try to provision a chat channel in Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the system reports that there's no license available. This occurs even though licenses have been purchased.

## Cause

The issue might occur if the required Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license isn't available or assigned.

Licenses currently attached may be insufficient, such as basic or other messaging channel licenses, and don't include the necessary Customer Service Enterprise license required for provisioning the chat channel.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps below:

1. Verify whether the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Service Enterprise license or Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan license is purchased and available in the tenant.

2. Ensure the license is assigned to the appropriate users.

3. Ensure the users have active subscription to the appropriate add-ons.

To confirm the required licenses and provisioning prerequisites, see [Omnichannel for Customer Service system requirements](/dynamics365/customer-service/implement/system-requirements-omnichannel).
