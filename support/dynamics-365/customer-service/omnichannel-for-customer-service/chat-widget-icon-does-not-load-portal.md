# Chat widget icon doesn't load on the portal

## Symptoms

The chat widget icon you configured doesn't load on the portal in Omnichannel for Customer Service. The chat widget icon URL that was configured as default doesn't load.

## Resolution

You can use an icon of your choice by specifying the link of the icon in the **Chat widget** configuration page. For the steps, see [Configure a chat widget](/dynamics365/customer-service/add-chat-widget#configure-a-chat-widget).
