# Conversation is stuck in the Wrap-up state

This article provides a resolution for the issue where a conversation is stuck in the **Wrap-up** state in Omnichannel for Customer Service.

## Symptoms

As an agent or a supervisor, you see some conversations are stuck in the **Wrap-up** state in your Omnichannel Agent Dashboard or Omnichannel Ongoing Conversations Dashboard.

## Cause

The primary agent assigned to the conversation may not have closed it in the session panel.

## Resolution

When conversations are ended by the agent or customer, they transition to the **Wrap-up** state. To close the conversation, the primary agent assigned to the conversation needs to close the conversation in the session panel. To learn more about closing sessions, see [Manage sessions in Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/oc-manage-sessions). To learn more about the **Wrap-up** conversation state, see [Understand conversation states in Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365/customer-service/oc-conversation-state#wrap-up).
