# Conversations from custom channel not appearing in Inbox

This article addresses the issue where conversations from a custom channel aren't visible in the inbox within Dynamics 365 Customer Service workspace.

## Symptoms

Conversations from a custom channel aren't visible in the inbox when using the Customer Service workspace.

## Cause

The issue occurs because custom channels aren't supported for inbox functionality. This behavior is by design.

## Resolution

1. Review the list of supported inbox channels in the documentation [Configure the inbox](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/configure-inbox).
2. If required, use a supported channel to enable inbox functionality for your conversations.

If you require additional support or have specific requirements for custom channel functionality, consider reaching out to Microsoft Support. Provide details of your current inbox configuration and the custom channel setup to facilitate further investigation.
