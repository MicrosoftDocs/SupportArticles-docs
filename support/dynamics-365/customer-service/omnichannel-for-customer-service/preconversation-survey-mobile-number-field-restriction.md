# Preconversation survey mobile number field restriction

This article provides information about the behavior of the mobile number field in a preconversation survey, which currently allows alphanumeric input instead of restricting input to numbers and digits only.

## Cause

The mobile number field in the preconversation survey currently allows alphanumeric input. This design doesn't enforce restrictions to numeric values only.

### Solution

Now, it isn't possible to restrict the mobile number field to accept only numeric input. However, this restriction could be proposed as a feature enhancement through the [Microsoft Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/):

1. Visit the [Microsoft Ideas portal](https://experience.dynamics.com/ideas/).
2. Provide details about your use case and the need for numeric-only restrictions in the mobile number field.
3. Engage with the community by voting for similar ideas or discussing your suggestion.
