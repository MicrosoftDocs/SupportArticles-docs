# Primary entity isn't available when creating SLAs

This article provides a resolution for the issue where the primary entity isn't available when you create a service-level agreement (SLA) in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Symptoms

The primary entity isn't listed to create an SLA for the entity.

## Cause

An SLA isn't enabled for the entity, and an active KPI wasn't created.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, enable an SLA for the entity and create an active KPI. For more information, see [Enable entities for service level agreements](/dynamics365/customer-service/enable-entities-service-level-agreements#enable-entities-for-service-level-agreements).
