# "Modern flow is not valid for ExecuteWorkflow" error

This article provides a resolution for the issue where you receive the "Modern flow is not valid for ExecuteWorkflow" error when running a service-level agreement (SLA) modern flow.

## Symptoms

An SLA modern flow fails with the following error:

> Modern Flow [flow ID] is not valid for ExecuteWorkflow.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the callback registrations are missing from the flow.

## Resolution

To solve this issue, turn off and then turn on the SLA modern flow.

Here are the steps to turn off or turn on a flow:

1. Sign in to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/) with a user who has the permissions to edit a flow.

2. Select the right environment from **Environments** in the upper-right corner.

6. Select the respective flow, and then select **Turn off** and then **Turn on** from the top menu.

    If you aren't sure about the flow name, select any one of the listed flows, replace the flow ID (you can get it from the error message) in the URL from the browser's address bar, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Then, select **Turn off** and then **Turn on** from the top menu.

    Here's a sample URL where you need to replace the flow ID, which is immediately after "flows" in the address:

    `https://make.powerautomate.com/environments/Default-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/solutions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/flows/[flow ID]/details?utm_source=solution_explorer`
