# Can't delete a managed solution consisting of an SLA-enabled entity

This article provides a resolution for the issue where you can't delete a managed solution consisting of a service-level agreement (SLA) enabled entity in Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

## Symptoms

You can't delete a managed solution that contains an entity with an SLA enabled on it. This entity has been created as part of a previously imported solution.

## Cause

Once enabled on an entity, an SLA can't be disabled.

Use this example to understand the issue:

1. Create a new solution in *Org1* and name it *Field solution*.
2. Create a new entity in  *Field solution* and name it *Field work*.
3. Export *Field solution* as a managed solution.
4. Import *Field solution* into a new org named *Org2*.

Next:

1. Create another solution in *Org1* and name it *Delta Field solution*.
2. Associate the entity *Field work* with *Delta Field solution*. Enable the SLA on the entity.
3. Export *Delta Field solution* as a managed solution.
4. Import *Delta Field solution* into *Org2*.

Now, if you try to delete *Delta Field solution* from Org2, you can't delete it because it has a *Field work* entity associated with it that has the SLA enabled.

## Resolution

To delete a managed solution with an SLA-enabled entity, you need to first delete the previously imported managed solution that created the entity entry. This action ensures that the entity entry is deleted. Then, you can create the entity again or reimport the managed solution.

To delete *Delta Field solution* in *Org2*, delete *Field solution* first.

*Field solution* can be deleted because the entity associated with it —*Field work*— doesn't have SLA enabled. Deleting *Field solution* ensures that both the SLA configuration and the entity are deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> This workaround won't work for the out-of-the-box entities because you can't delete out-of-the-box entities or managed solutions that have out-of-the-box entities associated with them.
