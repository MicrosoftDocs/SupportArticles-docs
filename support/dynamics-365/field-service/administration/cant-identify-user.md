# Can't identify the user in a Dynamics 365 Field Service error message

This article helps administrators resolve issues identifying a user in a Field Service error message that contains a user ID.

## Prerequisites

You have administrator permissions in Dynamics 365 Field Service.

## Symptoms

A user ID is listed in an error message from Dataverse and you can't identify the user.

## Resolution

Dataverse errors relating to a user show the Field Service user ID, not the Microsoft Entra ID. The Dataverse user ID is specific to the environment. To identify the user:

1. In the Field Service app, select your Field Service environment.

1. On the bottom left, select **Settings** > **Users**.

1. Select any user so that the `systemuser&id` appears at the end of the URL.

1. Replace the ID number with the ID in the error message and press **Enter**. The user's account tied to this ID appears.
