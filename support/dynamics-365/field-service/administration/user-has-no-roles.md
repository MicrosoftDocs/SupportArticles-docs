# Incorrect user privileges errors in Dynamics 365 Field Service

This article helps frontline managers or administrators resolve privileges errors that occur when a user tries to access [work orders](/dynamics365/field-service/field-service-architecture) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service.

When a user tries to access work orders, the following error messages appear, indicating that the user doesn't have the correct privileges.

- If the user has no privileges within the environment, the following error message appears:

    > An error has occurred. Please contact your administrator.

- If the user has some privileges but not all the required ones to complete the user action, an error message like the following appears:

    > You do not have prvCreatemsdyn_workorder permission to access msdyn_workorder records. Contact your Microsoft Dynamics 365 administrator for help.

## Resolution
