# Can't delete record because of a restrict-delete relationships

This article helps resolve issues with deleting records with a *restrict-delete* association in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service.

## Symptoms

Related records with a *restrict-delete* association block the record deletion.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, identify the relevant entities with such relationships, and then delete the records of those entities related to the record you are now trying to delete.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Customizations**.
2. Select **Customize the system**.
3. Locate the entity with records you want to delete, such as **Accounts**.
4. Go to **1:N Relationships** for the entity.
5. Find any relationships where the **Type of Behavior** is *Referential, Restrict Delete*.
6. Take note of the related entity for each of those relationships; these are the type of records that might restrict your ability to delete the record.
