This article helps administrators resolve an issue in the [Resource Scheduling Optimization add-in](/dynamics365/field-service/rso-overview) for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Field Service.

## Symptoms

The "SAS Key hasn't been configured" error message appears when users try to [publish a schedule](/dynamics365/field-service/rso-schedule-optimization#buttons-and-functions-for-optimization-schedules).
