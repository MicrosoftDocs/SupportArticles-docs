# Data quality error: Error code: ERR00015 [Type: Warning]

This article provides a resolution for the Data quality error (error code ERR00015) that occurs in [Business performance analytics](/dynamics365/finance/business-performance-analytics/business-performance-analytics-home-page) in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance.

## Symptoms

When inputs are processed in the [dimensional data model](/dynamics365/finance/business-performance-analytics/business-performance-analytics-data-model), an unresolvable error occurs, and the *ERR00015* error code is logged in the **Bpa self help logs** table in Microsoft Dataverse. In this case, the output table is empty, and reports are missing data. The details of the unresolvable error are included in the log details.

Here's an example of a record:
