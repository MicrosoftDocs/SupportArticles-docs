## Symptoms

In the business performance analytics dimensional data model, the number of rows in any fact or dimension should match the number of rows in the Dynamics 365 Finance driving table. To ensure that it holds true, 
there are multiple checks which business performance analytics does internally when joining multiple tables during transformation. If, in any of these joins, the count of rows in the output is different from 
source table, Error code *ERR00009* is logged in the **Bpa self help logs** table in Microsoft Dataverse.

## Resolution

No immediate action is required. This issue might stem from data synchronization delays. We recommend observing the next two - three business performance analytics runs to see if the error resolves itself. 
If the issue persists and there's still an error in the **Bpa self help logs** table, it's recommended contact Microsoft support.

Here's an example of a record:

BPA_COUNT_CHECKVIOLATION. There is a mismatch in the row count of tables used to generate the General Ledger Account Dim dimensional table. 
Details: mserp_ledgertransvoucherlinkbientity join violated count check. 
Prejoin count â€“ 40550, Postjoin count - 40450
