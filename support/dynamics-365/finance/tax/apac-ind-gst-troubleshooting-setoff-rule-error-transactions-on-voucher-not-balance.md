# Setoff rule error when a tax settlement is run

When you run a tax settlement, you might receive an error message. Follow the steps in the sections of this article to fix the error.

## Find the version of the setoff rule that is currently used

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Sales tax** > **Maintain setoff hierarchy profiles**.
2. Use the values in the **Effective date** column to find the version of the setoff rule that is currently used.

## Review the settings of the setoff rule

1. Go to **Tax** > **Setup** > **Sales tax** > **Sales tax hierarchies**.
2. Select the setoff rule that is currently used.
3. On the **Versions** FastTab, select **View** to determine which sales tax hierarchies are used.
4. Select **Setoff rules for sales tax hierarchies**.
5. Determine whether the **Recoverable** and **Payable** nodes are selected according to the setoff. If the nodes aren't marked as defined, there might be a posting issue. In this case, contact Microsoft.
