# Tax transaction ID is incorrect

You can take the following steps to correct the tax transaction ID:

1. The code logic to generate transaction ID is in `TaxGSTInvoiceHelper_IN::generateGSTTransID()`. Set a breakpoint there, and start debugging.

2. If the issue isn't resolved after completing step 1, determine whether customization exists. If no customization exists, contact Microsoft Support for further assistance. If possible, provide the trace file for the posting step.
