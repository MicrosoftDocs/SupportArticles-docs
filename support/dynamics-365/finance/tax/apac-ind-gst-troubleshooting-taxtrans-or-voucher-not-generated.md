# TaxTrans or voucher isn't generated

Complete the steps in this article if after posting tax there are records missing when you check the voucher and posted sales tax.

## Check if the subledger journal transferred

1. Go to **General ledger** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Subledger journal entries not yet transferred**.
2. Transfer any record in the list, and then check the voucher and posted sales tax again.

## Check tax configuration

1. Check the posting profile of the expected measure. Select the posting type in the **Debit/Credit** column, and then select **Edit**.
2. In the **Posting type** page that opens, check the value in the **Tax accounting provider** field.

The following table lists the rule for posting tax transactions and vouchers that are decided by the tax accounting provider. Correct the configuration if it's not working as expected.

   |   Tax accounting provider   |   Posting tax transaction   |   Posting voucher   |
   | --------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | Tax                         | Yes                         | Yes                 |
   | Ledger                      | No                          | Yes                 |
   | Other                       | No                          | No                  |

## Check the formula

1. Select **Condition** to open the formula.
2. Check the condition, and correct the tax configuration if it's not working as expected.
