# TaxTrans record isn't generated

If you select **Posted sales tax** for a transaction, but the **Posted sales tax** page either shows no tax lines or is missing a tax line, the **TaxTrans** record might not have been generated.

To solve this issue, complete the steps in the following sections as required.

## Check the sales tax before you post the transaction

1. Before you post the transaction, on the **Posting invoice** page, on the **Overview** FastTab, select **Sales tax** to check the calculation.
2. On the **Temporary sales tax transactions** page, review the result of the calculation. If no tax is calculated, see [Tax isn't calculated or the tax amount is zero](sales-tax-troubleshooting-tax-not-calculated-amount-zero.md).

## Find the TaxTrans record in all posted sales tax

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Inquiries and reports** \> **Sales tax inquiries** \> **Posted sales tax**.
2. In the **Voucher** column heading, select the filter symbol to find the **TaxTrans** record.
3. If you find the sales tax records that you're looking for, check the date. If the date differs from the date of the journal header, create a Microsoft service request for additional support.

## Debug to check details

1. For information about how to debug and determine whether **TmpTaxWorkTrans** and **TaxUncommitted** are correctly generated, see [Field value in TaxTrans is incorrect](sales-tax-troubleshooting-field-value-taxtrans-incorrect.md).
2. If **TaxTmpWorkTrans** or **TaxUncommitted** is correctly generated, add a breakpoint at `TaxPost::SaveAndPost()` and `Tax::SaveAndPost` to debug the reason why **TaxTrans** isn't inserted. Here are the screenshots of this step:

## Determine whether customization exists

If you've completed the steps in the previous sections but have found no issue, determine whether customization exists. If no customization exists, create a Microsoft service request for further support.
