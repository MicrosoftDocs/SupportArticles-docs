# Voucher isn't generated on the Voucher transactions page

If a voucher should be generated, but the **Voucher transactions** page doesn't show any vouchers, follow the steps in the following sections as required to solve this issue.

## Check the tax applicability

1. Go to **Tax** \> **Periodic tasks** \> **Subledger journal entries not yet transferred**.
2. If there's a journal record, select it, and then select **Transfer now**.
3. Open the **Voucher transactions** page again to see whether the voucher was generated.

## Determine whether customization exists

If you've completed the steps in the previous section but have found no issue, determine whether customization exists. If no customization exists, create a Microsoft service request for further support.
