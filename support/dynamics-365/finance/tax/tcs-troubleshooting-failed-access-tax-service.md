# "Failed to access tax service" error when selecting a value in Feature setup name

This article explains how to fix the "Failed to access tax service" error of the Tax Calculation service.

## Symptoms

In Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance, you go to **Tax** \> **Setup** \> **Tax configuration** \> **Tax service parameters**. On the **General** tab, you enable the **Enable tax calculation** option. If you then try to select a value in the **Feature setup name** field, the following error message occurs:

> Failed to access tax service.

## Cause

This error occurs because Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance can't access the Tax Calculation service.

## Resolution

1. Sign in to Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS).
2. On the **Environment** page, on the **Environment add-ins** tab, find the **Tax Calculation** item, and review its status. The status should be **Installing** or **Installed**. If the Tax Calculation service add-in isn't installed, you'll receive the error.

## Mitigation

1. In LCS, on the **Finance** page, in the **Power platform integration** section, select **Install a new add-in**.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and select the **Tax Calculation** add-in to install it.
3. Return to your Finance environment, and try to access the Tax Calculation service.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you install the Tax Calculation service, review the [Tax Calculation Service prerequisites](/dynamics365/finance/localizations/global-get-started-with-tax-calculation-service?context=%2Fdynamics365%2Fcontext%2Ffinance#prerequisites).
>
> If you can't install the add-in because the **Power platform integration** section isn't available, see [Add-in overview](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/add-ins-overview). If you still receive the error after you install the add-in, contact your system administrator.
