# Can't make a video call in the HoloLens app

This article provides a resolution for an issue where you can't make a video call in the Microsoft HoloLens app.

## Symptoms

You can't make a video call in the Microsoft HoloLens app.

## Resolution

To solve this issue, first you should verify if:

1. Your Dynamics 365 Guides version is earlier than 7.0. If yes, [update your client app](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/upgrade) or contact your admin.
2. You're currently offline. If yes, reconnect to the internet.

If the issue still exists, contact your admin to verify if:

- You're [disabled the option directly from the Dynamics 365 Guides web portal](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/admin-enable-calls).
- You're assigned an incorrect Microsoft Teams license. [Learn more about licensing requirements](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/requirements)
