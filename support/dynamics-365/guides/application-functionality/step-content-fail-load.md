# "Step content failed to load" error occurs in the HoloLens app

## Symptoms

The following error message displays in the HoloLens app:

> Step content failed to load.

:::image type="content" source="media/step-content-fail-load/step-content-failed-to-load-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the error message about step content failed to load.":::

## Cause

The amount and complexity of content added to the step has reached HoloLens' memory limit, which will result in a poor experience for the operators of the guide. You can't place more 3D models at this point. If a model was previously placed in the world, it's represented as an exclamation point icon to authors and operators.
