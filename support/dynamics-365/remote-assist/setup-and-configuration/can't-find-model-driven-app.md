# Can't find the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app

This article provides a resolution for an administrator to ensure a user can find the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app.

## Symptoms

A user can't find the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app.

## Cause

The user doesn't use the right environment or have the correct security role.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> To solve this issue, you need the following administrator accesses:
>
> - Admin access to the [Microsoft Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
> - Admin access to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal).
> - Admin access to the environment where Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is installed in.

1. Check the environment name in the URL to ensure you're accessing the right environment.

2. Ensure that the [app is installed into the right environment](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/ra-webapp-install#install-the-dynamics-365-remote-assist-model-driven-app).

3. Verify that you have the **Remote Assist - App User** or **Remote Assist - Administrator** and **Basic User** [security roles assigned](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/asset-capture-add-users#assign-dynamics-365-security-roles).

4. Verify that the [app is enabled](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/asset-capture-add-users#manage-app-roles) for the **Remote Assist - App User** and **Remote Assist - Administrator** security roles.
