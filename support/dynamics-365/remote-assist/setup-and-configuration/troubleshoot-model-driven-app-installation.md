# Troubleshoot failures with the installation of the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app

There are several reasons why the installation of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app might fail.

> [!NOTE]
> To solve the issue, you need the following administrator accesses:
>
> - Admin access to the [Microsoft Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
> - Admin access to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal).
> - Admin access to the environment where Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is installed in.

## Symptoms 1: Missing dependencies

### Cause

You try to install the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist model-driven app in an environment that isn't enabled for Dynamics 365 apps.

### Resolution

Install the app in an environment where other Dynamics 365 apps, such as Dynamics 365 Field Service or Dynamics 365 Sales, are installed. Or [create a new environment](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/ra-webapp-install) that's enabled for Dynamics 365 apps.

## Symptoms 2: Can't enable Dynamics 365 apps when creating an environment

### Cause

An active Dynamics 365 Remote Assist subscription is missing.

### Resolution

1. View your subscriptions in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

1. If you don't see a trial subscription for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist, create a [subscription-based trial environment](/power-platform/admin/trial-environments#create-a-trial-subscription-based-environment-in-the-power-platform-admin-center) and enable the Dynamics 365 apps option.

## Symptoms 3: Not enough capacity to create environments

### Cause

Environment creation requires at least 1 GB of available database capacity.

### Resolution

Paid subscriptions of Dynamics 365 Remote Assist provide a default tenant entitlement of 10 GB of database capacity (if Dynamics 365 Remote Assist is your first Dynamics 365 subscription). See [new Dataverse storage capacity](/power-platform/admin/capacity-storage) for possible resolutions.

## Symptoms 4: The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app doesn't show up in the Power Platform admin center

### Cause

An active Dynamics 365 Remote Assist subscription or license is missing.

### Resolution

1. Check to ensure that you have an active Dynamics 365 Remote Assist subscription.

2. Try assigning a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license to your account from the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to force a license sync to occur. After five minutes, check if the app appears in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com).

3. If the issue isn't resolved, file a support request by going to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com) and selecting **Help + support** > **New support request**.
