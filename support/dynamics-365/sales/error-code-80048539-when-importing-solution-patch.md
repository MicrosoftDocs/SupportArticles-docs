## Cause

> [!NOTE]

Error code **80048539** indicates an invalid patch is being imported. There are a few potential causes including the following:

### Cause 1

If you see the error details mentioned in the Symptom 1 Details section mentioned above:

The solution patch version is lower than the version of the solution already installed. For example: A solution named SolutionA is already installed with version 1.1.0.0 and you are trying to import a patch that is version 1.0.1.0.

### Cause 2

If you see the error details mentioned in the Symptom 2 Details section mentioned above:

This can occur if you already have an upgrade imported for that solution but it has not yet been applied. After importing a solution that is an upgrade of an existing solution, the end of the solution import provides a button to apply the solution upgrade. If you did not select that button during a prior import of a solution upgrade for this solution, you need to locate the solution in your solutions list and select the **Apply Solution Upgrade** button.

## Resolution

### Resolution 1

If you see the error details mentioned in the Symptom 1 Details section mentioned above:

Verify the solution patch version you are trying to import is a higher version than the solution already installed.

### Resolution 2

If you see the error details mentioned in the Symptom 2 Details section mentioned above:

Navigate to **Settings**, **Customizations**, and then select **Solutions**. Select the existing installed solution you are trying to upgrade and then select **Apply Solution Upgrade**.
