# Error Code: 2147812097 Invalid License: This application requires a license and you don't have an appropriate license assigned

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when you try to access an app module (business application) which requires an appropriate license and isn't assigned.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4548022

## Symptoms

When a user tries to access an app module (business application) which requires an appropriate license and isn't assigned, the user receives the following error message:

> This app requires a license and you don't have the appropriate license to access this app. Please contact your administrator to get the appropriate license assigned, as per details provided.  
Details

## Cause

This issue occurs when an application requires a license and the administrator hasn't assigned the appropriate license to the user(s) of the application.

For example, if the user with a team member license tries to access the Customer Service Hub application, the user will see this error:

> This app requires a license and you don't have the appropriate license to access this app. Please contact your administrator to get the appropriate license assigned, as per details provided.

## Resolution

The resolution is to reach out to your administrator and request the license to be assigned. The license name and the application names are present in the error details.

**Access to Custom Apps:**

For access to custom apps (canvas or model-driven), you need to be assigned a Dynamics 365 Enterprise or Professional license, **Power AppsPer User** plan or the environment needs to be given **Power Appsper app** plans (aka **app passes**). For more information about **Power Appsper app** plans (aka **app passes**), see [About Power Apps per app plans](/power-platform/admin/about-powerapps-perapp).
