# Installing product updates in Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online appears to stay in Installing updates phase

This article provides a workaround for an installation status update issue that occurs after installing product updates in Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online or Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Service Pack 1.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2976176

## Symptoms

After you select **Install Product Updates** in Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online Spring '14 or Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 Service Pack 1, the status stays in the **Installing updates** phase.

## Cause

This can occur if you previously attempted to install product updates and encountered an error. The status may appear in the **Installing updates** phase but is actually complete. Microsoft is aware of this issue and plans to fix it in a future update.

## Workaround

Refresh your browser page by pressing the F5 key or using the refresh button in your browser. If installation is complete, the page will show **Congratulations** indicating that the installation has completed successfully.
