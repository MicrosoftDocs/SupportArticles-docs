# Customers can't hear a seller in a call

This article provides a resolution for an issue where customers can't hear a seller in a call in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales.

## Symptoms

When a seller and a customer talk in a call in Dynamics 365 Sales, the customer can't hear the seller.

## Cause 1: An incorrect device is selected

The issue occurs because the seller doesn't select the correct microphone device in the dialer's device settings.

#### Resolution

To resolve the issue, ensure the correct microphone device is selected by following these steps:

1. Select the three dots ("...") icon on the dialer menu, and then select **Device Settings**.

## Cause 2: Microphone isn't enabled in the web browser

The issue occurs because the web browser can't access your microphone.

#### Resolution

To enable the access to your microphone in the web browser, follow these steps:

1. Open the browser, navigate to the Dynamics 365 Sales page, and select the lock icon in the address bar.

1. Select **Allow** in the pop-up window to enable the access. Depending on the browser you use, the pop-up window may be slightly different, but the process of enabling the access remains the same. The following screenshots show the **Allow** option in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

   - The **Allow** option in Google Chrome:

If you have previously disabled access to your microphone in the web browser, you can also re-enable it by selecting the lock icon in the address bar.

- In Google Chrome, turn on the toggle next to **Microphone**.
