# Troubleshoot issue with opening chat windows in Dynamics 365

When you try to open an existing chat or start a new chat from Dynamics 365, an error might be displayed. The error might be displayed because your organization uses Trusted Sites and doesn't enable the URLs for Dynamics 365. To resolve this error, change the settings for your browser using administrator rights or a Group Policy Object (GPO).
