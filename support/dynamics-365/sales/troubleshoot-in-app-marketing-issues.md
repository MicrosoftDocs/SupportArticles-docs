# Troubleshoot issues with in-app marketing

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve issues related to in-app marketing.

## Issue 1 - Members view isn't available when you open the Marketing List form

### Cause

The issue is occurring due to the customization of views for each subgrid in the Marketing List form, causing the member list to appear empty.

9. Select **OK**.
10. Repeat steps 5 through 9 for **Accounts** and **Leads**.
11. Save and publish the form.

## Issue 2 - Can't associate a campaign created from the Marketing List form with a Marketing List record in Unified Interface

### Cause

The issue occurs because the attribute **TmpRegardingObjectId** has been removed from the Campaigns form.

7. Save and publish the form.

## Issue 3 - Can't find a related account field for a member account by using advanced find in Unified Interface

### Cause

The issue occurs because the Contact or Account display name has been changed in the application, and the **Company Name (RELATED_TYPE)** picks the related type from the changed display name.

### Resolution

In Unified Interface, the company name entity is available as **Company Name (Account)**. For example, if you rename the **Account** as **Organization**, the entity will be renamed as **Company Name (Organization)**.

## Issue: Can't send emails by using the email quick campaign distribution list

### Cause

The issue occurs because of one of the following reasons:

- The users don't have permissions to send emails on behalf of other users.
- The owner of the record (marketing list members) hasn't allowed other Dynamics 365 users to send emails on the owner's behalf.

### Resolution

To resolve the issue, do one of the following:

- For the user who's creating the quick campaign, the **Send Email as Another User** privilege must be assigned to at least one role assigned to the user. For more information, see [Create a security role with team member's privilege inheritance](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges#create-a-security-role-with-team-members-privilege-inheritance).

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-unable-send-email-assign-role.png" alt-text="Provide permission to send email as another user privilege for the user.":::

- For the owner of the record, the **Allow other Microsoft Dynamics 365 users to send email on your behalf** checkbox must be selected under **Select whether other users can send email for you** on the **Set Personal Options** dialog box.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-allow-send-email-behalf-owner.png" alt-text="Allow other users to send email on the owner's behalf.":::

## Issue 4 - Can't change the form field in the email within the quick campaign wizard

### Cause

The issue is caused by insufficient permissions for the **Send Email as another User** option for your role.

### Resolution

Provide sufficient permissions for the **Send Email as another User** option to one of your roles.

## Issue 5 - Can't see email templates in the distribute dialog box

### Cause

The email template selector in Unified Interface relies on certain access levels for different entities.

### Resolution

To resolve the issue, users require access to system user records. Provide the access to system users by assigning them security roles in your Dynamics 365 organization. For more information, see [Configure user security to resources in an environment](/power-platform/admin/database-security).

## Issue 6 - The campaign distribution process is stuck with a status of Pending or Failed

### Cause

The campaign distribution process requires a workflow to run in the background. When the workflow is disabled, campaign distribution won't be completed and will be stuck in a **Pending** or **Failed** state.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, enable the workflow background process and then activate the **ActivityPropagation** process.

#### Enable the workflow background process

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **System** > **System Jobs**.
2. Go to **ActivityPropagation** jobs and under **Process Sessions**, select the job that matches or approximately matches, the date and time at which the quick campaign was run.

3. Verify that an error message is displayed under the details section, stating that the async operation was skipped because the org is in **Disable Background Processing** mode. Update the settings for your environment by doing the following:

   1. Go to the Dynamics 365 admin center, select your instance, and then select **Admin Settings**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-admin-settings.png" alt-text="Select Admin Settings from the admin center.":::

   1. Clear the **Disable background operations** checkbox.

      :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-clear-background-operations.png" alt-text="Clear the Disable background operations checkbox.":::

4. Save your settings, and exit.

#### Activate the ActivityPropagation process

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2. From the site map, go to **Processes**.
3. In the view selector, select **All**.

    All the available processes are displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-select-all-view-selector.png" alt-text="Select All in the view selector to see all the available processes.":::

4. Select the **ActivityPropagation** process, and then select **Activate**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-activate-activity-propagation-process.png" alt-text="Activate the ActivityPropagation process by selecting the Activate button.":::

## Issue 7 - My quick campaign failed and it's set to Aborted

### Cause

The issue is caused by the failure of a stack trace that's related to the custom plug-ins in the workflow process.

### Resolution

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **System** > **System Jobs**.
2. Go to **ActivityPropagation** jobs and under **Process Sessions**, select the job that matches or approximately matches, the date and time at which the quick campaign was run.

The system job contains information that includes the stack trace that has the failure. Resolve the failure as mentioned in the stack trace failure documentation.

## Issue 8 - The quick campaign is executing an unstoppable loop and generating thousands of failure records

### Cause

Due to unknown conditions, when a workflow fails to create campaign activities, it goes into an unstoppable loop and keeps creating campaign activities, which all fail. You'll observe that the number of failures keeps increasing until it exceeds the number of members in the targeted marketing list.

### Resolution

Deactivate the **ActivityPropagation** workflow, and then activate it again.

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2. From the site map, go to **Processes**.
3. In the view selector, select **All**.

    All the available processes are displayed.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-select-all-view-selector.png" alt-text="Select All in the view selector to see all the available processes.":::

4. Select the **ActivityPropagation** workflow, and then select **Deactivate**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-deactivate-activity-propagation-workflow.png" alt-text="Deactivate the ActivityPropagation workflow.":::

5. Wait 24 hours, and then reactivate the **ActivityPropagation** workflow.

## Issue 9 - Campaign distribution doesn't create activities on target entities

Target records (account, contact, and lead) can identify their preferences for receiving marketing materials through campaign distribution: these include emails, phones, fax, and bulk mail.

Campaign activities are created for members of the Marketing List only when their preferences are set to **Allow** or **Send**.

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-distribution-set-contact-preferences-allow-send.png" alt-text="Set contact preferences to allow or send.":::

## Issue 10 - Campaign distribution is failing for some members

### Cause

Campaign distribution is based on the members in the marketing list. The member can be an account, contact, or lead. A campaign distribution can fail for members due to one of the following reasons:

- There's no email address associated with the member.
- The email address associated with the member is invalid.
- The member has configured the **Send Marketing Material** field in the member record as **Do not send**.

### Resolution

Review the detailed reason for the failure in the **Excluded members** grid, and take any necessary action.

## Issue 11 - The Campaign tab isn't available in account, contact, or lead forms in Unified Interface

### Cause

Because there's no direct relationship between the campaign table and accounts, contacts, or leads, the **Campaign** tab isn't available in those forms. The only way to view the campaign list is through a distributed campaign activity, because a distributed campaign activity is the true indication that a target entity is being used in a campaign.

### Resolution

To resolve the issue, add the **Campaign Activities** tab to the form.

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we're using the Account entity.

1. Go to **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Customizations** > **Customize the System**.
2. From **Components**, select **Entities** > **Account** > **Forms**.
3. Open the form to which you want to add the subgrid.
4. On the form page, select the **Insert** tab, and then select **One column**.

    A new column is added as a tab.

5. Select the tab, and then select **Change Properties**. The **Tab Properties** dialog opens.
6. Enter the values for **Name** and **Label** as **Campaign Activities**, and then select **OK**. The tab is then renamed as **Campaign Activities**.
7. Select the **Campaign Activities** tab, go to the **Insert** tab, and then select **Sub-Grid**.

    The **Set Properties** dialog for the subgrid opens.

8. On the **Display** tab, enter the following information:
    - In the **Name** section, for the unique name, enter **Campaign_Activities**.
    - In the **Name** section, for **Label**, enter **Campaign Activities**.
    - In the **Data Source** section, do the following:
        - For **Entity**, select **Campaign Activities**.
        - For **Default View**, select **All Campaign Activities**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-in-app-marketing-issues/campaign-activities-subgrid-properties.png" alt-text="entering values on the Display tab for the subgrid.":::

9. Save the changes and publish the form.

To verify that the issue has been resolved, open the account that has been used in campaigns and has some distributed campaign activities. Select the **Campaign Activities** tab to verify that the related campaign activities appear.

## Issue 12 - User is getting timed out when trying to delete a static marketing list

### Cause

Deletion of a static marketing list with a large number of members (more than 50,000) takes much time, and results into a time-out.

### Resolution

It's recommended to first remove all members from the marketing list by using [Remove using Advanced Find](/dynamics365/sales/create-marketing-list-using-app-marketing-sales#remove-using-advanced-find), and then delete the marketing list. For the better performance of application and avoid time outs, remove the members in the marketing list in groups of 10,000 at a time. For example, if there are 20,000 members in a marketing list and you want to remove the members. Remove 10,000 members first and then remove the other 10,000.
