# Troubleshoot issues with Dynamics 365 Sales Professional

Use the following troubleshooting topics to quickly find information to solve your users' issues.

## Issue 1 - Can't sign up for a Sales Professional trial

### Cause

If your Microsoft 365 tenant administrator has disabled trial sign-up for your organization, you'll see the following error message:

> Your IT department has turned off signup for Dynamics 365 Sales Professional Trial. Contact them to complete signup.

There are two ways that the tenant administrator can prevent users from performing self-service sign-up:

- Prevent email sign-ups for the tenant by using the `AdHocSubscriptionsNotAllowed` parameter
- Prevent new users to be created within the tenant (`NewUsersNotAllowed`).

### Resolution

Contact your IT department and work with them to help you sign up.

## Issue 2 - "Something went wrong building your Sales Pro experience. Do you want to try again?" error occurs when signing up

When you sign up, you receive the following error message:

> Something went wrong building your Sales Pro experience. Do you want to try again?

### Cause

There are several possible reasons for this error:

- You've already signed up for the Sales Professional application for your tenant, and are trying to sign up again by using other credentials for the same tenant before the expiry of the first trial instance.

- You aren't using the complete sign-up URL, but are using the reply URL present in the sign-up URL. For example, you're using `https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com` instead of [https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?sku=9c7bff7a-3715-4da7-88d3-07f57f8d0fb6&RU=https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?sku=9c7bff7a-3715-4da7-88d3-07f57f8d0fb6&RU=https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com).

- The Sales Professional trial license that's assigned to you as part of the sign-up process isn't synced with Microsoft Entra ID.

### Resolution

Try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. Clear your browser cache, and close the browser.
2. Wait for at least five minutes, and then open the browser in private browsing mode.
3. Use the full [sign-up URL](https://signup.microsoft.com/Signup?sku=9c7bff7a-3715-4da7-88d3-07f57f8d0fb6&RU=https://salesprotrial.dynamics.microsoft.com).
