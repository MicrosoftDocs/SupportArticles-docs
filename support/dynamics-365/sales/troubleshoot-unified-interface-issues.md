# Troubleshoot issues with Unified Interface

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve issues related to Unified Interface.

## Issue: Out-of-the-box or custom entities appear as read-only in Unified Interface apps

Some out-of-the-box and custom entities are appearing as read-only in the Sales Hub app (Unified Interface). However, these entities are editable in the legacy web client. Some out-of-the-box buttons are also unavailable on the forms in Unified Interface.

### Cause

This could happen when an entity is set to be read-only in Unified Client.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. On the navigation bar in your app, select the **Settings** icon and then select **Advanced Settings**.

2. On the navigation bar, select **Settings** and then select **Customizations**.
