# The Last tested date field isn't updated when multiple quality orders are created

KB number: 4612803

## Symptoms

The **Last tested date** field isn't updated when multiple quality orders are created.

## Resolution

The system is behaving as designed. The last tested date isn't related to quality orders. It stores the date when the finished goods were first purchased or manufactured. This date is used to calculate the shelf life advice date.
