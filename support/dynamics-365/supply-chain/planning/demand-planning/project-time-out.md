# An import profile job fails with a "Timeout" error

This article provides a resolution for the "Timeout" error that occurs when an [import profile job](/dynamics365/supply-chain/demand-planning/import-data#create-an-import-profile-for-importing-directly-from-supply-chain-management) fails in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## Symptoms

The Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations import profile job fails, and the job execution details contain an error mentioning "Timeout."

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use one or both of the following options:

### Resolution 1

Make sure all quality updates related to the Demand planning entities are installed.

For the available quality updates, see [Export of Historical Sales Demand and Demand planning Picking List Journal Entries never complete](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?kb=0&bugId=900476&dbType=3&qc=88596efab831d21cd42a8cb8c261bd5bbc1e4b0bb4599458dbfce8a775d5c8da).

### Resolution 2

Filter out the dataset to make sure an import profile job exports less data.

1. Select the corresponding Demand planning data management project with a name that looks like **DP-XML-NameOfEntity-NameOfProfile**.
2. Make sure you're in enhanced view and select the filter button.
3. Add filters to reduce the size of the export. Good candidates for filtering are company-related fields or date ranges.

    For more information about Dynamics 365 data filters, see [Advanced date queries that use SysQueryRangeUtil methods](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/advanced-filtering-query-options#advanced-date-queries-that-use-sysqueryrangeutil-methods).

In this case, when you run the import profile job from the Demand Planning app, the filters are respected, and therefore, the data is filtered out.
