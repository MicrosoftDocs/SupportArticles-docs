# Default tax group and cash discount aren't filled in from the invoice account

## Symptoms

If you're using an invoice account that differs from the customer account, a default tax group and a default cash discount aren't filled in from the invoice account when a purchase order is created.

## Resolution

This behavior is by design. The default values for the tax group, cash discounts, and other price information are based on the customer account, not the invoice account.
