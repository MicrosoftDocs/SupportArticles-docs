# A purchase order tuck in Review Due to Quantity Update Error

## Symptoms

A purchase order (PO) is stuck in review due to an error stating:
Update has been canceled. Quantity cannot be reduced because the remaining update quantity changes sign.

### Cause

This error in Dynamics 365 occurs when there is an issue with quantity adjustments, preventing the PO from progressing in the workflow.

## Resolution

Here are steps to resolve the issue:

##Verify Quantity Fields

Ensure that the quantities are correctly specified and that adjustments do not result in negative values.

##Update Purchase Order Lines

Navigate to the purchase order lines and manually update the quantities.
Go to Procurement and Sourcing, select the problematic PO, and update the lines accordingly.

##Recalculate Remainders

Use the recalculation functions to update the status and remainders.
Select the purchase order line and use the Recalculate deliver remainder or Recalculate invoice remainder options.

##Workflow Resubmission

If the issue persists, recall the workflow, make necessary adjustments, and resubmit it.

## Additional Steps:

Procurement and Sourcing > Periodic Task > Clean up > Correct purchase order manually

In the correct company, select the affected purchase order and execute the following action: Reset modified.
This process runs at the line level. If unblocking the full order, execute the action for each line individually.
The modified field in the form's grid will indicate which lines have been reset.
After completing these steps, the workflow should be unblocked, allowing the user to proceed.
