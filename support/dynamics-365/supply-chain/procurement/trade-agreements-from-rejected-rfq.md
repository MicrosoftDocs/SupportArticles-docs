# Trade agreements can be created from rejected RFQs

## Symptoms

Trade agreements can be created from rejected request for quotations (RFQs). Therefore, the system doesn't prevent trade agreement journals from being created if the RFQ line hasn't been accepted.

## Resolution

This is the expected behavior. You can create trade agreements for any replies for a request for quotation (RFQ), regardless of whether they were accepted or rejected. For more information, see [Requests for quotation (RFQs) overview](/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/request-quotations).
