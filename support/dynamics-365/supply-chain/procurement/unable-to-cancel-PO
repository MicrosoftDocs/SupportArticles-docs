# Can't cancel a Purchase Order that is budget-enabled within the closed period.

## Symptoms

When attempting to cancel or request a change to a purchase order, the system displays the following error messages:
# Error Message 1: "Budget control is enabled. This purchase order cannot be cancelled as the accounting date period is either on-hold or closed. You can use the purchase order year-end close process to move the purchase order to the next fiscal year or open the ledger calendar associated with the accounting date."
# Error Message 2: "A change cannot be made to this purchase order as the accounting period is on hold or closed. You can use the purchase order year-end close process to update the order to the next fiscal year."

## Cause
This behavior is by design and follows the standard behaviors of D365 when cancelling a Purchase Order (PO). Below are the scenarios and steps to resolve the issue:
 # Fiscal Year Example:
   Fiscal Year: April 2023 â€“ March 2024
  
# Scenarios When You Can Cancel an Open Order PO:
  # Budget Check Not Performed or Failed: If the PO has not undergone a budget check or if the budget check has failed, you can cancel the PO.
  # Budget Check Passed but Closed Period is Not the Last Period of Fiscal Year:
    If the PO has passed the budget check and the closed period is not the last period of the fiscal year, the system will find the next open/available period within that fiscal year.
    Example: If the PO has an accounting date in December 2023, and the period for December 2023 is closed but January, February, and March 2024 are not closed, you can still cancel the PO without opening the December 2023 period.

# Scenarios When You Cannot Cancel an Open Order PO:
  # Budget Check Passed and Accounting Date Falls in the Last Period of Fiscal Year:
    If the PO has passed the budget check and the accounting date falls in the last period of the fiscal year (e.g., March 2024), and the period is closed, you cannot cancel the PO without opening the closed period.

## Workaround
To cancel PO, must open the closed/on-hold period for March 2024 as indicated by the blocking error message.
It is recommended to open the period during non-business hours to minimize the risk of other users logging into the system and creating records in the closed period.
