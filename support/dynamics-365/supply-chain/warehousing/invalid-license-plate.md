# Invalid license plate error when scanning license plate ID in the mobile app

## Symptoms

When you scan a license plate ID in the Warehouse Management mobile app, you might receive the following error message:

> Invalid license plate.

## Resolution

Make sure the license plate ID exists in the license plates table, and that the items and quantities on the license plate are available (in other words, they aren't blocked).
