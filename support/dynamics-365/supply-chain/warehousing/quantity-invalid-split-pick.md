# Quantity is not valid when performing a split pick across multiple batches

## Symptoms

When you try to perform a *split pick* across multiple batches, you receive the following error message:

> The quantity is not valid for unit %1.

## Resolution

The warehouse worker must use the *short picking* process in the Warehouse Management mobile app. If you're trying to pick multiple batches from the same location, you can also use the **Full** option in the app.
