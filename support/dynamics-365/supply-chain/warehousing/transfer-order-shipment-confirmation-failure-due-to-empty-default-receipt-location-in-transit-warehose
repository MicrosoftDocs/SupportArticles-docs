# Transfer order shipment for load could not be confirmed - Dimension Location cannot be left blank if dimension Batch/Serial number is set

Error code: WAX2543, WAX439, SYS18738, SYS25904

## Symptoms

When you try to confirm a Transfer order shipment, the system shows the following error message

> The shipment for load %1 could not be confirmed.
> Dimension %1 cannot be left blank if dimension %2 is set.
> Update has been canceled.

Therefore, you can't confirm the shipment for the load.

## Cause

This can happen if the Transit warehouse does not have a Default receipt location.

## Resolution

To configure the Default receipt location for a Transit warehouse, follow these steps.

1. Go to **Warehouse management** > **Setup** > **Warehouse** > **Warehouses**.
1. Select the Transit warehouse.
1. Select **OK**.
1. Select **Yes** to confirm that you want to cancel the work.
