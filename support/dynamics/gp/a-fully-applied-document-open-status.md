# A fully applied document is still in open status in Payables Management

This article provides a solution to an issue where a fully applied document is still in open status in Payables Management.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3208146

## Symptoms

When reviewing the Aged Trial Balance report or Historical Aged Trial Balance (HATB) report in Payables Management, a document shows up as fully applied and is still in the open table. I should have moved to history automatically. How do I get the document to move to history now?

## Cause

Fully applied document where the Amount Remaining is $0.00 should automatically move to history during the posting process. If it didn't, there's data corruption.

## Resolution

Review these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, go to **Inquiry**, select **Purchasing**, and select **Transaction By Vendor**. Select to unmark the WORK and HISTORY checkboxes and select **Redisplay** to view documents only in OPEN status.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the **View | Currency | Functional** to view the document in Functional Currency.

2. Select to expand the line, and review all open documents. Locate the problem document. If the Unapplied Amount is $0.00, it's fully applied (which is the CURTRXAM field in the PM20000 table.)

3. Next, select/highlight the problem document and select the **Unapplied Amount** link to drill back to view the records applied against it. Verify that the total of the Applied Amount field for all the apply records adds up to the total amount of the document to verify that it's fully applied.

    If not and there should be dollars left on it to apply to, then update the CURTRXAM field in the PM20000 table for the amount that should still be unapplied on the document.

4. If the applied records match the total document amount and the document should be in history, you can go to Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** and select **Check Links**. Select the **Purchasing series**. Insert over the Payables Transaction Logical File and select **OK**. Check links should move all document in the open table with an amount remaining of 0.00 to history.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You aren't able to in-do check links, so make sure to have a current backup first, or do it in a test company first to review what it all did and to make sure you agree before you run it on your live database, to prevent any surprises.

5. Review in Purchasing Inquiry to see if the document has now moved to history.

6. If not, then use the scripts below to locate the remittance records for it in the PM20100 table, and delete these records. The PM20100 remittance table is just a table that stores apply records solely for the purpose of printing them on the next check stub sent to the vendor (if you're printing previously applied documents). Once the records are printed, they're removed from this remittance table, or just build in this table if they aren't printed. This record may hold it up from moving to history and doesn't hurt anything to remove this record. Delete it from the PM20100 remittance table once you've located it. Below are helpful scripts to use to locate it in this table.

    ```sql
    select * from PM20100 where VENDORID = 'xxx' and DOCDATE = '2017-04-12'
    --update the vendor ID and the document date for the problem document to help locate it.

    Delete PM20100 where DEX_ROW_ID = X
    --update the script for the dex row ID you with to remove.
    ```

7. After deleting the remittance document from the PM20100 table, then run check links again and it should move to history now. (See step 4.)

8. Review in Purchasing Inquiry again to verify the document has now moved to history.
