# "A save operation on table 'syReportProcessingStatusHdr' cannot find the table" error message when printing remittances in Payables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when printing remittances in Payables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2901385

## Symptoms

When processing remittances for EFT in Payables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP, this error happens:

> A save operation on table 'syReportProcessingStatusHdr' cannot find the table

## Cause

This message is caused by having the **template** option turned on to use Word Templates, but the users don't have a template set up. The *syReportProcessingStatusHdr* table is a temp table used to store the header information for the processing status of a Word Template. It's created as needed.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue:

1. Go to **Reports|Template Configuration**.

2. Select to expand **Enable all templates for all companies**.

3. Mark the appropriate selection as described below for your scenario:

    - If you don't use templates in any of the companies, then unmark the checkbox for **Enable Report Templates** option in the bottom-left corner.
    - However, if you do use templates in other companies, but this company, then uncheck the checkbox next to the Company database(s) that donâ€™t use templates in the top portion of the window.
4. Select **Save**.
