# "A To, CC, or Bcc Address could not be found" error when sending EFT emails in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides a resolution for the issue that when you send EFT emails in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you receive an error message that states a To, CC, or Bcc Address could not be found.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3124509

## Symptoms

When sending EFT emails in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you receive this error message:

> A To, CC, or Bcc Address could not be found.

## Cause

Email address missing.

## Resolution

Resolve the message by following these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP:

    For Purchasing, select **Cards**, point to **Purchasing** and select **Vendor**.

    For Sales, select **Cards**, point to **Sales**, and select **Customer**.

2. First go to the bottom of the Vendor or Customer Maintenance window, and note the ADDRESS ID in the following field:

    REMIT TO field for a vendor  
    SHIP TO for sales documents for a customer  
    STATEMENT TO field for a statement for a customer

3. Next, to the right of the ADDRESS ID field (in the middle of the page), select the **Internet Information** icon (looks like a *world*).

4. In the Internet Information window:

    1. Scroll to the Address ID that you noted earlier in step 2 above.
    2. Then in the E-mail Addresses section, enter email addresses in the TO..., CC... or Bcc.... fields as needed. (Filling in all is not required.)
    3. Save.

5. Back on the Vendor/Customer Maintenance Card, select the **E-MAIL** button at the bottom. Make sure the appropriate type of document you want to send in email is marked.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Enable** button simply acts as a **Mark All/Unmark All** button only. Its the checkbox next to the document type that counts.

   You can also select a Message ID to be used, and Format type, and other settings as desired. Save your changes.

6. Now test sending the email again.
