## Summary

You can add a shortcut to view the calculated work records for the calculated batch in Canadian Payroll.

This information can be viewed any time after the batch is calculated. It is overwritten when the next batch is calculated.

## Add the "Display Calc Work Records" shortcut in Canadian Payroll

Open this window using the method appropriate for the version you're using below:

For Microsoft Dynamics GP 2015:

To open this window in Microsoft Dynamics GP 2015 and higher versions, click on **Transactions**, point to **Payroll-Canada**, and click **WORK-Display Calc Work Records**.

For all versions of Microsoft Dynamics GP:

Use these steps to add the shortcut to this window for any version of Microsoft Dynamics GP:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, click on the **HOME** area page.

2. Right-click on **Shortcuts** in the left navigation pane.

3. Click **Add**.

4. Click **Add Window...**

5. In the **Add Window Shortcut** window, click to expand **Canadian Payroll**, and click to expand **Project**.

6. Scroll down and click on **WORK - Display Calc Work Records**.

7. Click **Done**. (Click **Yes** if prompted to save changes.)

Now click on **Shortcuts** again in the left navigation pane and you'll see **WORK-Display Calc Work Records** listed. Click to open it. Enter the Employee ID. You'll be able to see all the calculated amounts from the last payrun including Federal/Provincial tax information, T4/T4A/R1 information, CPP/EI information, Taxable/Before Tax and After tax information, SCB, RRSP, EHT, GST, Banked Information for paid and accumulated, and Vacation-paid and accrued.

## More information

This information is still available to view after you post, so you can view what was on the last payrun. It will be overwritten when the next payroll batch is calculated.
