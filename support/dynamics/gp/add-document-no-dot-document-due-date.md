    Q&A  
    Q: After following the above steps, I unmark **print previously applied documents** during the select checks process, but previously applied records still print.

    A: Add another restriction to the report. In the PM10201 table, computer checks have a **1** in the Select_To_Print field, but previously applied checks don't. So to restrict out previously applied information, add this restriction to the report:

    > PM PAYMENT APPLY WORK.Select to Print = 1
