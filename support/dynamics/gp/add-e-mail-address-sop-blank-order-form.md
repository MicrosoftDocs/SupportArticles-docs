# How to add the customer e-mail address to the SOP Blank Order Form report or to the SOP Blank Invoice Form report in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to add the customer e-mail address to the SOP Blank Order Form report or to the SOP Blank Invoice Form report in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 874101

## Introduction

***Update**

New information: Use the **RW_GetInternetText** function in Report Writer instead. This function will pull directly from the **TO** field. The calculated field should look something like this below, pulling the Customer ID and **Statement To** address ID, with integers 30, 1 and 10 behind it. The calc field should be set to a STRING result type.  
**FUNCTION_SCRIPT(RW_GetInternetText"CUS"RM_Customer_MSTR.Customer IDRM_Customer_MSTR.Customer Address Code - Statement To30110 )**

## Prior article information: (alternate option)

To add the customer e-mail address to the SOP Blank Order Form report or to the SOP Blank Invoice Form report in Microsoft Dynamics GP, use the **RW_GetInternetInfo** Report Writer function to pull the EMAIL field from the same Internet information window as the email address is in.

- The email address used with Word Templates is stored in the **EmailToAddress** field in the Internet Addresses (SY01200) table, and you can't directly link this field to the SOP blank order form. Use the alternative solution described below.
- Use the **RW_GetInternetInfo** function that pulls the email address from the **INET1** field in the same Internet Addresses (SY01200) table.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can copy the **EmailToAddress** field to the **INET1** field all within the same SY01200 table.
- In Dynamics GP, the email address needs to be in the **E-MAIL** field under the **INTERNET** **INFORMATION** section on the address ID (that is, middle section of the same window).  Instruct users to key the email address in the **E-MAIL** field in both sections going forward.

To add the customer e-mail address to the SOP Blank Order Form report, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps also apply to the SOP Blank Invoice Form report.
