## Back up and open the report

1. If you have modified any reports, back up the Reports.dic file. If you have not modified any reports, go to step 2.

    To locate the Reports.dic file, follow these steps:

    2. If you are prompted to enter a system password, type your password.
    3. Click **Microsoft Dynamics GP** or **Great Plains**. The path of the Reports.dic file appears in the **Reports** box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Reports.dic file only exists if you previously modified a report.

2. Start Report Writer, and then use the appropriate method:

    - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 click **Microsoft Dynamics GP**, point to **Tools**, point to **Customize**, and then click **Report Writer**.

    - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 and earlier versions, point to **Customize** on the **Tools** menu, and then click **Report Writer**.

3. In the **Product** list, click **Microsoft Dynamics GP** or **Great Plains**, and then click **OK**.
4. In Report Writer, click **Reports**.
5. In the **Original Reports** column, select the purchase order report that you want to modify.
6. Click **Insert** to add the report to the **Modified Reports** column.
7. Click **Open**, and then click **Layout**.

## Modify the report sections

1. On the **Tools** menu, click **Section Options**.
2. In the **Additional Footers** section, click **New** to open the **Footer Options** dialog box.
3. In the **Footer Name** box, type *ORD*.

5. In the **Field** list, click **Ord**.
6. Click **OK**.
7. In the **Additional Footers** section, click **Comment 1 Footer**, and then click **Remove**.

    If you are prompted to remove the footer, click **Yes**.
8. Repeat step 7 for the following footers in the **Additional Footers** list:

    - **Comment 2 Footer**
    - **Comment 3 Footer**
    - **Comment 4 Footer**

## Modify the calculated fields

1. In the resource list in the Toolbox window, click **Calculated Fields**.
2. Click **sSuppressComment1**, and then click **Open** to open the **Calculated Field Definition** dialog box.
3. In the **Expression Type** section, click **Conditional**.

    If you are prompted to destroy the current expression, click **Continue**.

3. Repeat step 1 and step 2 so that you add a total of four **Comment** fields.

    When you are prompted for an array index for each field, type 2 for the second field, type 3 for the third field, and then type 4 for the fourth field.

4. In the **F3** section, move the **Comment4** field to the side of the report.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This comment field will not appear in the printed report. However, this comment field must be in the margin so that a calculated field will work.

6. Move the following fields outside the margin of the report:

    - **Manufacturer Item Number**  
    - **Manufacturer**  
    - **Item Description**

7. Drag the **B** section to create sufficient space in the body of the report so that the maximum number of comment lines that you might enter will fit.

    For example, if you print 10 lines of comments, the **B** section should be 10 lines long.
8. Resize the **Comment Text** field to occupy the whole **B** section.
