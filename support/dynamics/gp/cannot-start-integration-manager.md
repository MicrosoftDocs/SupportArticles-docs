    Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0:  
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Integration Manager 10\Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.exe`

4. Select **Add** and then select **Done**. You'll now be able to start Integration Manager on the Shortcut Menu in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## Resolution 5

    - Category: Select the appropriate category (for example, select **Other** or **System**)

3. Select the **Integration Site Enabler** check box in the Access List area.

## Resolution 6

Next, make sure Integration Manager appears in the Dynamics.set file. Open the Dynamics.set file and see if Integration manager is in there. If it isn't continue with the following.

To resolve this issue, do the following steps:

1. Copy the IM.cnk file from the following folder:
    - For Integration Manager 2010: `C:\Program Files\Common Files\Integration Manager 11`
    - For Integration Manager 10.0: `C :\Program Files\Common Files\Integration Manager 10`

2. Paste the IM.cnk file into the following folder:
    - For Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP2010`
    - For Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP 10`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you didn't install to the default location, you'll need to paste this file in your Dynamics GP code folder.

3. Start Microsoft Dynamics GP.
4. Select **Yes** to include new code.
5. Start Integration Manager.
6. Run your integration.

Once you open start Microsoft Dynamics GP, it will ask to add new packages when it first starts, select **OK** past that screen and let it verify Integration Manager's installation. (If you don't have this IM.cnk file anywhere on your computer, copy it from another computer.)

## Resolution 7

1. Open the Dex.ini file in notepad. This file is found in the following default locations for example:

    Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010:  
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP2010\Data`

    Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0:  
    `C:\Program Files \Microsoft Dynamics\GP10\Data`

2. Verify that the following lines exist:
    IMPath=
    IMExecPath=

    The lines will point to:

    Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010  
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Integration Manager 11\Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.exe`
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Integration Manager 11\Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.IMRun.exe`

    Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Integration Manager 10\Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.exe`
    `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\Integration Manager 10\Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.IMRun.exe`

If you're still meeting the issue, do a search for the Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.exe on your workstation. You'll need to change the path in your dex.ini to match the location of where your Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.exe and Microsoft.Dynamics.GP.IntegrationManager.IMRun.exe files are located.
