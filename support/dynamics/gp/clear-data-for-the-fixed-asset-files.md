## Remove both the asset general information and the asset book information

If you want to remove both the asset general information and the asset book information, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you follow the instructions in this article, make sure that you have a complete backup copy of the database that you can restore if a problem occurs.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools**  on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP**  menu, point to **Utilities**, point to **Fixed Assets**, and then select **Clear Data.**  
2. In the **Series** list, select **Financial**. (The **Display** option in the menubar should default to Logical.)
3. To insert the following logical tables, select the tables, and then select **Insert**.
   - Fixed Assets Master
   - Fixed Assets Index Master
   - Fixed Assets Financial Master
4. Select **Process**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you receive any error messages for the Fixed Assets Financial Master Note tables, you must re-create the FA00902.* files. To do it, follow these steps:

    1. Exit Microsoft Dynamics GP.

    2. Open SQL Query Analyzer, and then select the company database.

    3. Enter the following query.

        ```sql
        Delete FA00902
        Delete FA00905
        ```

    4. To run the query, select the green arrow, or press F5.

    5. Start Microsoft Dynamics GP.

5. Run the import again.

## Remove only the book information

If you want to remove only the book information, follow these steps:

1. Make a full backup copy to protect the data.
2. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Utilities**, point to **Fixed Assets**, and then select **Clear Data**.
3. In the **Series** list, select **Financial**.
4. In the top menubar, select **Display** and then select **Physical**.
5. To insert the following physical tables, select the table name, and then select **Insert**.

    - Asset Book Master (FA00200)
    - Asset Financial Detail Master (FA00902)
    - Asset Book ITC/Cost Adjustment Master (FA00300)
    - Fixed Assets General Ledger Interface WORK (FA00905)
6. Select **Process**.
