_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 918078

## Symptoms

When you run a Sales Order Processing integration in Integration Manager together with Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 or Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0 to map the sales commission data that is in the Commissions mapping folder, the data is not imported into Microsoft Dynamics GP or into Microsoft Great Plains.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the Sales Commission Entry window in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Great Plains recalculates some of the field values.

## Resolution
