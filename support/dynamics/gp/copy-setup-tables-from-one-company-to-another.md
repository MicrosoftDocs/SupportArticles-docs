> [!NOTE]
> If you are copying Analytical Accounting (AA) setup tables from company A that has AA activated to company B that does not yet have AA activated, you must first install and activate AA in company B. After AA is activated in company B, copy these AA setup tables from company A. Then, use the script in Method 1 in Knowledge Base (KB) article 897280 to update the next available values that are stored in table AAG00102 in the Dynamics database for the AA setup tables. This script will prevent you from receiving error messages of primary key issues.
