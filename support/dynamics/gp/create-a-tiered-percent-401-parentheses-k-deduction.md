## Introduction

Many employers match an employee's 401(k) contributions up in a tiered manner.

For example, a company may decide to match 100 percent of an employee's 401(k) contribution up to 3 percent of the employee's gross wages. Then, a company may decide to match 50 percent of an employee's 401(k) contribution from 3.1 percent through 5 percent of the employee's gross wages. The employee can decide to withhold more than 5 percent of the gross wages. However, the amount that exceeds 5 percent of the gross wages is not matched by the company.

First, you've to set up the 401(k) deductions. Then, you've to set up the matching benefits.

    - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, point to **Setup** on the **Tools** menu, point to **Payroll**, and then select **Deduction**.
