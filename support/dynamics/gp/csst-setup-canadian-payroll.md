# CSST Setup for Canadian Payroll in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article contains steps to set up CSST in Canadian Payroll.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4101476

## Symptom

Improper setup can lead to errors on the poster file stating that it doesn't balance or an account is missing.

## Cause

It's often caused by the Debit Account not being set up for CSSTDR.

## Resolution

1. Setup your CSST Deduction and make sure that you select **Gross Pay** for the Calculate Rate on, and select **CSST Premiums** for the Further Identification.

1. Setup a CSSTDR code. It doesn't need to have the Further Identification selected. It's used to read to the account for the debit portion of your CSST code.
