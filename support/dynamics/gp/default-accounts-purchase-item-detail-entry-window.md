_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 857766

## Introduction

This article describes how the accounts default in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0.

## The item in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is an inventoried item

- The value in the **Inventory Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window defaults from the **Inventory** field in the Item Account Maintenance window. To open this window, point to **Inventory** on the **Cards** menu, click **Item**, and then click **Accounts**.

- If the **Inventory** field in the Item Account Maintenance window contains no account number, the inventory account number defaults from the **Inventory Control** field in the Posting Account Setup window. To open this window:

  In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Posting**, and then click Po **s** ting **Accounts**.  In the Display List, click **Inventory**.

- If no inventory account number exists in either the Item Account Maintenance window or the Posting Account Setup window, the **Inventory Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is empty.

## The item in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is a noninventoried item

- The value in the **Purchases Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window defaults from the **Purchases** field in the Vendor Account Maintenance window. To open this window, point to **Purchasing** on the **Cards** menu, click **Vendor**, and then click **Accounts**.

- If the **Purchases** field in the Vendor Account Maintenance window contains no account number, the purchases account number defaults from the **Purchases** field in the Posting Account Setup window. To open this window:

   In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Posting**, and then click Po **s** ting **Accounts**.  In the Display List, click **Inventory**.

- If no purchases account number exists in either the Vendor Account Maintenance window or the Posting Account Setup window, the **Purchases Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is empty.

## The item in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is a drop-ship item

- The value in the **Drop-Ship Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window defaults from the **Drop Ship Items** field in the Item Account Maintenance window. To open this window, point to **Inventory** on the **Cards** menu, click **Item**, and then click **Accounts**.

- If the **Drop Ship Items** field in the Item Account Maintenance window contains no account number, the drop-ship account defaults from the **Drop Ship Items** field in the Posting Account Setup window. To open this window:

  In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Posting**, and then click Po **s** ting **Accounts**.  In the Display List, click **Inventory**.

- If no drop-ship account number exists in either the Item Account Maintenance window or the Posting Account Setup window, the Drop Ship Account in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window is empty.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enter a drop-ship order for a noninventoried item, the **Drop Ship Account** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window defaults from the **Drop Ship Items** field in the Posting Account Setup window. In the **Display** list, click **Purchasing**.

## Project Accounting information

- In versions that are earlier than Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 Service Pack 3

  If Project Accounting is registered and if a value exists in the **Project Number** field and in the **Cost Cat. ID** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window, the account information defaults as mentioned in the previous sections. Because a value exists in the **Project Number** field and in the **Cost Cat. ID** field in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window, noninventoried items are not posted to the account that is displayed in the **Purchasing Account** field for the later receiving transaction.

- In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 Service Pack 3 and in later versions

  Starting with Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 Service Pack 3, changes were made to the account that defaults in the Purchasing Item Detail Entry window to show a truer picture of what account is used in the receiving process. Consider the following scenarios for noninventoried items:

- A **Cost Plus** project type or a **Fixed Price** project type displays the **Work in Process (WIP)** account from the source window.

- A **Time and Materials** project type that has a **When Billed** value in the **Accounting Method** field displays the **Work in Process (WIP)** account from the source window.

- A **Time and Materials** project type that has a **When Performed** value in the **Accounting Method** field displays the **Cost of Goods Sold** account from the source window.

- A **Time and Materials** project type that has the budget set up with a **Bill Type** of **Non-billable** or **No Charge** displays the **Cost of Goods Sold** account from the source window.

- A **Time and Materials** project type that has a **When Billed** value in the **Accounting Method** field and where the **WIP** account is sourced to **None** displays the **Cost of Goods Sold** account from the source window.

> [!NOTE]
> To determine the source window, follow these steps:

1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Project**, and then click **Project**.
2. In the Project Maintenance window, click **Budget**.
3. Click the cost category from the transaction, and then click the **Cost Category** expansion window.
4. In the Budget Detail Entry window, click **Accounts** to review the source that is selected. If no account exists in the source window, the account defaults from the Posting Account Setup window.
5. In the **Display** list, click **Project**.
