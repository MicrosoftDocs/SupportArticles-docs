### Step 1 - Back up the company database

Before you follow the steps to resolve these issues, make a complete backup of the company database to prevent data loss.

> [!NOTE]
> You may want to use a test company database that has a copy of live company data. When you do this, users will not have to log off from Microsoft Dynamics GP or from Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains while you test the steps to resolve these issues. After you have tested the steps, you can process these steps against the live company data after all the users have logged off at the end of the workday. For more information about how to set up a test company database that uses live company data, see
