This article describes the Management Reporter Base Collector diagnostic. This Support Diagnostics Platform (SDP) manifest file collects general information about a Microsoft Management Reporter configuration.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2615173

When you run this diagnostic, it prompts you for the location of the Management Reporter services. To run all tests successfully, you must have Administrator credentials on the computer where the Management Reporter services and client are installed.

This diagnostic checks most Cause items that are listed in [Error message when you start Microsoft Management Reporter 2012: "Can't connect to the Management Reporter server"](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/error-message-when-you-start-microsoft-management-reporter-2012-can-t-connect-to-the-management-reporter-server-f359a2ea-5998-040a-2472-0c778cafd71d) and collects version information about your Management Reporter installation. When the diagnostic is finished, upload the results to Microsoft so that a Support Engineer can review them and determine how to continue.
