# Description of the Asset Financial Detail Summarize feature in Microsoft Great Plains Fixed Assets

This article describes how the Asset Financial Detail Summarize feature works in the Microsoft Business Solutions Great Plains Fixed Assets module.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 892916

To open the Asset Financial Detail Summarize window, select **Routines**, select **Fixed Assets**, and then select **Summarize Financial**.

When you run the Asset Financial Detail Summarize routine, the routine collects all the transactions in the Fixed Assets module that fall within the dates that you specify in the **To** box and in the **From** box. This routine creates a summary of all the transactions. The summary information is sorted by asset. The details for each asset are sorted by type.

After you run the Asset Financial Detail Summarize routine, you cannot bring back the detail information. To see the detail information, you must restore from a backup.
