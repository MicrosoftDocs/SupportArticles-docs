_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP

## Summary

The values in the **Begin Date** field and in the **End Date** field for a project in the Project Maintenance window are derived from the earliest begin date and from the latest end date in the following windows:

To determine whether the begin date and the end date are accurate for a project, review the information in each of these windows.
