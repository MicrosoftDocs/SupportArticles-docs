## Introduction

When you process the Pay As You Go (PAYG) vendor summaries and the Business Activity Statement (BAS) for Australian taxation reporting in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, you may receive many error messages or warning messages.

The error messages display a red cross. The warning messages display a yellow exclamation mark. If the message is a warning, the processing code has found something incorrect that will not affect the results. If the message is an error message, the processing code has found something incorrect that will cause the results to also be incorrect.
