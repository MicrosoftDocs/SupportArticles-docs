# Description of the support of Microsoft Dynamics GP in a virtual environment

This article describes the support of Microsoft Dynamics GP in a virtual environment.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 937629

## More information

Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 and later versions are the only versions that are supported in a virtual environment.

When you deploy a system in a virtual environment, make sure that you have sufficient hard disk space to avoid performance problems. Each computer that you deploy in a virtual environment should meet or exceed the random access memory (RAM) requirements and the hard disk space requirements. Use the requirements for systems that are deployed in a non-virtual environment.

The following virtual environments are supported.

### Hardware virtualization

- Microsoft Virtual PC
- Microsoft Virtual Server
- Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V

### Software virtualization

- Microsoft SoftGrid 4.2
- Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) 4.6
