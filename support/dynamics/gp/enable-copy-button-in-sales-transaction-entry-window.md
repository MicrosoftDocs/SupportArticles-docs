# How to enable the "Copy" button in the Sales Transaction Entry window, Purchase Order Entry window, and Item Maintenance window in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to enable the **Copy** button in the Sales Transaction Entry window, in the Purchase Order Entry window, and in the Item Maintenance window in Microsoft Dynamics GP. To use the **Copy** button, you must grant access to certain fields. This article describes how to grant access to these fields.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 936563

## Introduction

In versions that are earlier than Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 8.0, if the **Copy** button is not enabled, you must install a chunk file to enable the **Copy** button in specific windows. In Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 8.0, in Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, and in Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, the Copier Series is integrated with the code. Therefore, you do not have to install the chunk file. However, you must grant access to the Copier Series for the **Copy** button for specific windows in Sales Order Processing, in Purchase Order Processing, and in Inventory.
