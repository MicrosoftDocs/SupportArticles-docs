This article describes how to enter and view purchasing returns in Microsoft Dynamics GP when you use Project Accounting. The article lists the inquiry windows that you can use to view the posted purchasing return transactions.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP

## Introduction

Purchasing returns can be entered for both inventory items and non-inventory items. You can enter the following kinds of purchasing returns:

- **Return**  
- **Return w/Credit**  
- **Return from Project**

**Return w/Credit** transactions and **Return from Project** transactions update the Payables Management module. A **Return** transaction does not update the Payables Management module.

## How to enter purchasing returns for inventory items

- Enter a purchasing return for a Shipment transaction in the Returns Transaction Entry window. To open this window, point to **Purchasing** on the **Transactions** menu, and then click **Returns Transaction Entry**. In the **Type** list, click **Return**.

- Enter a purchasing return for a Shipment/Invoice transaction in the Returns Transaction Entry window. To open this window, point to **Purchasing** on the **Transactions** menu, and then click **Returns Transaction Entry**. In the **Type** list, click **Return w/ Credit**.
