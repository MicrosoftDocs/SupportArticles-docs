## View the information for shipping historical transactions

To view the information for shipping historical transactions, you must read directly from the IS010210 table. This table stores the shipping history information for both the outstanding transactions and the historical SOP transactions.

To find the data in the IS010210 table before and after the posting process is complete, use one of the following options.

### Option 1: Run a statement by using SQL Server

1. Start the Support Administrator Console, Microsoft SQL Query Analyzer, or SQL Server Management Studio. Use the method for the program that you're using.
   - For SQL Server Desktop Engine (also known as MSDE 2000), start the Support Administrator Console. To do it, click **Start**, point to **All Programs** > **Microsoft Administrator Console**, and then click **Support Administrator Console**.
   - For SQL Server 2000, start SQL Query Analyzer. To do it, click **Start**, point to **All Programs** > **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then click **Query Analyzer**.
   - For SQL Server 2005, start SQL Server Management Studio. To do it, click **Start**, point to **All Programs** > **Microsoft SQL Server 2005**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.
2. Run the following statement against the company database:

    ```console
    SELECT * FROM IS010210
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can modify your script to return the information that you want to see. This table lists both orders and invoices. This table also lists both unposted data and posted data.

### Option 2: Create a custom report

Use Report Writer to create a custom report. Note, however, that this option is outside the scope of technical support.

For more information about how to create a custom report, contact your MBS Partner or your MBS Professional.

### Option 3: Use SmartList Builder

Use SmartList Builder to create a SmartList object to display the data.
