# "Activity exists for this code. The Tax Status cannot be changed" error when you click to select or clear a check box in the Employee Deduction Maintenance window in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides resolution for error messages that occur when you click to select or click to clear a check box in the TSA Sheltered From area for a deduction in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 939918

## Symptoms

When you click to select a check box or when you click to clear a check box in the **TSA Sheltered From** area in the Employee Deduction Maintenance window, you receive the following error message:

> Activity exists for this code. The Tax Status cannot be changed.

Additionally, when you click to select a check box or click to clear a check box in the **Subject to Taxes** area in the Employee Benefit Maintenance window, you receive the same error message.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use the correct tax settings to create a new deduction code and to create a new benefit code.

> [!NOTE]
> If a benefit tax status or a deduction tax status is changed, the federal wages of the 941 report may differ from the federal wages of the payroll summary. Additionally, the reconcile process cannot adjust the difference. Therefore, to meet Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requirements, we recommend that you create a new deduction code or a new benefit code instead of changing the existing code.
