## Resolution

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

      2. In the Connect to Server window, follow these steps:

         1. In the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that is running SQL Server.

         2. In the **Authentication** box, click **SQL Authentication.**  

         3. In the **Login** box, type *sa*.

         4. In the **Password** box, type the password for the sa user, and then click **Connect**.

      3. In the Object Explorer pane, right-click the appropriate instance of SQL Server, and then click **Stop**.

      4. Right-click the appropriate instance of SQL Server again, and then click **Start**.

   - If you use SQL Server Enterprise Manager, follow these steps:

       1. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then click **Enterprise Manager**.

       2. Right-click the appropriate instance of SQL Server, and then click **Stop**.

       3. Right-click the appropriate instance of SQL Server again, and then click **Start**.

   - If you do not have SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Enterprise Manager, follow these steps:

      1. Click **Start**, click **Run** and then type *services.msc*.

      2. Click the appropriate instance of SQL Server, and then click **Stop**.
