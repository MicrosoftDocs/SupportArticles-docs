## More information

If you still receive one of the error messages that is described in the "Resolution" section, try these troubleshooting suggestions.

- Create a Dexsql.log file, and then locate the error message that you received in the Dexsql.log file. The data that comes before the error message may help you determine the cause of the error message.

  For more information about how to create a Dexsql.log file, see [KB 850996 - How to create a Dexsql.log file to troubleshoot error messages in Microsoft Dynamics GP](https://support.microsoft.com/help/850996).

- Determine whether the error message that you received is caused by a particular report. For example, if you receive the error message only when you print a particular order or invoice report, the problem may be caused by this report. In this situation, restore the Reports.dic file from a backup copy.

  > [!NOTE]
  > By default, the Microsoft Dynamics GP Reports.dic file is in the location:`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP`.

- Determine whether the error message that you received is caused by a modified report. To do this, print the original report. If you do not receive the error message when you print the original report, re-create the Reports.dic file.

  For more information about how to re-create the Reports.dic file, see [How to re-create the Reports.dic file in Microsoft Dynamics GP](https://support.microsoft.com/help/850465).

- Determine whether the error message that you received is caused by a particular user ID or workstation. To do this, start Microsoft Dynamics GP on a different workstation. Log on by using the user ID that was used when you received the error message. If you do not receive the error message, reinstall Microsoft Dynamics GP on the workstation on which you received the error message. If you do receive the error message on another workstation, the problem may be caused by the user ID. In this situation, create a new user ID.

- Determine whether the error message that you received is caused by a particular document number. If you receive the error message only when you use a particular document number, delete this document number. Then, reenter it.

- If you imported the data, manually enter a document in the Sales Transaction Entry window. If you do not receive the error message, the problem may be caused by the import process.

- Determine whether the error message that you received is caused by a customization or by a third-party product. To do this, disable the customization or the third-party products.

- Verify that the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) data source on the workstation is set up correctly.

- Determine whether the table contains damaged information. To do this, run the following statement in SQL Query Analyzer. Then, verify the records that are returned.

    ```sql
    Select * from <table_name>
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The **<table_name>** placeholder represents the actual table name.
