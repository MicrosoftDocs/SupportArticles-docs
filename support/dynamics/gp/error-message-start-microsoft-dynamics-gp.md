## Cause

This problem occurs when the `DEX_LOCK` and `DEX_SESSION` tables do not exist in the database TEMPDB Database in the SQL Server that is being used for Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## Resolution

- Method 1

  Restart the instance for SQL Server that is being used with Microsoft Dynamics GP. To do this, follow these steps depending on the SQL Server version you are using.

  - Microsoft SQL Server 2000

    1. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, and then click **Enterprise Manager**.

    2. In the **Connect to Server** window, follow these steps:

       1. In the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that is running SQL Server.

       2. In the **Authentication** box, click **SQL Authentication**.

       3. In the **login** box, type *sa*.

    3. Right-click the instance name of the SQL Server, click **Stop**, and then click **Start**.

  - Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and SQL Server 2008

    1. Click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005** or **Microsoft SQL Server 2008**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.

    2. In the **Connect to Server** window, follow these steps:

       1. In the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that is running SQL Server.

       2. In the **Authentication** box, click **SQL Authentication**.

       3. In the **login** box, type sa .

       4. In the Password box, type the password for the sa user, and then click **Connect**.

    3. Right-click the instance name of the SQL Server, and then click **Restart**.

- Method 2

  To resolve this issue, start Microsoft Dynamics GP or Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities as the sa user. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. On a computer that is running Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Dynamics**, point to **GP 10.0**, and then click **GP** OR click **Utilities**.

     - If you are running Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Dynamics**, point to **GP 9.0**, and then click **GP** OR click **Utilities**.

     - If you are running Microsoft Business Solutions Great Plains 8.0, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Business Solutions**, point to **Great Plains**, and then click **Great Plains** OR click **Great Plains Utilities**.

  2. In the login box, type *sa*.

  3. In the **Password** box, type the password for the sa user, and then click **OK**.

- Method 3

  To resolve this issue, re-create the tables by using the dex_req.sql script. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Locate the dex_req.sql file that is located in the installation folder.

     - If you are running Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 or 9.0, the default location is `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP\SQL\Utililty\0`.

     - If you are running Microsoft Business Solutions-Great Plains 8.0, the default location is located on a Server installation at `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Business Solutions\Great Plains\SQL\Util`.

  2. Open the dex_req.sql file in Query Analyzer or Management Studio, and then click **Execute** to run the script.
