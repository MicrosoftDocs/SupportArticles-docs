# Error message when you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP (This login failed. Attempt to log in again or contact your system administrator)

This article helps you resolve the problem that occurs when you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 919345

## Symptoms

When you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP, you may receive the following error message:

> This login failed. Attempt to log in again or contact your system administrator

## Cause

### Cause 1

This problem may occur if the password is changed at another computer. If the password is changed at another computer, the user cannot log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP at the user's computer. This situation occurs because the way in which the server name is set up in the Data Source (ODBC) differs from the way in which the server name is set up on the computer where the password is encrypted.

See Resolution 1 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 2

This problem may occur if the user logs on by using the incorrect case for the user ID or for the encrypted password. In this case, the error message is received at the next logon.

See Resolution 2 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 3

This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

- You are running Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0.
- A new user is created.
- The new user cannot log on.See Resolution 3 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 4

This problem may occur if the **Advanced Password Policies** check boxes are selected in the User Setup window when you update from Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000 to Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express.

See Resolution 4 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 5

This problem may occur if the public group does not have the Execute permission on the `smDex_Max_Char` stored procedure in the master database.

See Resolution 5 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 6

This problem may occur if you are using mandatory profiles together with Terminal Server.

See Resolution 6 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 7

This problem may occur if the following conditions are true:

- You are running Microsoft Small Business Financials.
- Not every new user can log on. Specifically, only the sa user can log on.See Resolution 7 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

### Cause 8

This problem may occur if the SQL login for the user is no longer present.

See Resolution 8 in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

## Resolution

### Resolution 1

To resolve this problem, verify the Data Source (ODBC) that you use for Microsoft Dynamics GP at the computer at which you receive the error message. To verify the Data Source (ODBC), click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, click **Data Sources (ODBC)**, and then double-click the DSN connection. In the list that appears, you should see one of the following things:

- The name of the computer that is running Microsoft SQL Server

- The TCP/IP address of the computer that is running SQL Server. This address appears in the **Servername** box. If you know neither the name of the computer that is running SQL Server nor the TCP/IP address of the computer that is running SQL Server, you can verify the Data Source (ODBC) on a working computer. For more information about an ODBC setup, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

[How to set up an ODBC Data Source on SQL Server for Microsoft Dynamics GP](https://support.microsoft.com/help/870416) How to set up an ODBC Data Source on SQL Server for Microsoft Dynamics GP  

### Resolution 2

The logon **User ID** field is now case-sensitive in Microsoft Dynamics GP. To resolve this problem, you must encrypt the user's password by using the correct case for the user ID. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP as the sa user.
2. Click **Tools**, point to **Setup**, point to **System**, and then click **User** if you use Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, or click **Microsoft Dynamics GP**, click **Tools**, point to **Setup**, point to **System** and then click **User** if you use Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 or Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010.
3. In the **User ID** box, click the lookup button, and then click the user who cannot log on.
4. In the **Password** box and in the **Confirm Password** box, type a new password.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Microsoft SQL Server 2005 or Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 and are in a Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008 domain, you can click to select the **Change Password at Next Login** check box in the User Setup window. For this feature to work correctly, the client computers must use SQL Native Client for the DSN connections that they use for Microsoft Dynamics GP.
