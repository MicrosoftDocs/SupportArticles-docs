# "You cannot install an older version of Back Office Service Tools" Error message when you start the Professional Services Tools Library from Shortcuts in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when you start the Professional Services Tools Library (PSTL) from Shortcuts in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 938108

## Symptoms

When you start the Professional Services Tools Library from the Shortcuts section of the navigation pane in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you receive the following error message:
> You cannot install an older version of Back Office Service Tools.

This problem occurs if you updated Microsoft Dynamics GP to a newer version.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the Professional Service Tools Library isn't updated when Microsoft Dynamics GP is updated to a newer version.

## Resolution

        - **C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP\R1838.DIC**
