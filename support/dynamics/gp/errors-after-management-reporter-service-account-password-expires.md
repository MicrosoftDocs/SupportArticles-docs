_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, Microsoft Dynamics SL 2011  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2666579

## Symptoms

You receive the following error message when you sign in to a company in Microsoft Management Reporter:

> The MRProcessService service was unable to log on as <domain\username> with the currently configured password due to the following error:
Logon failure: unknown user name or bad password.

You may also receive the error:

> Error 1069: The service did not start due to a logon failure

## Cause

The Active Directory domain account that is used for the Management Reporter Process Service or the Management Reporter application pool has an expired password.

## Resolution

Update the password stored for the Management Reporter service account for the Windows Service and IIS. To perform this, follow these steps:

1. All users must exit the Management Reporter Report Designer and Report Viewer applications.

2. Change the password for the account. To do this, sign in to a computer joined to your domain as the Active Directory account selected to run the Management Reporter services and change the password. Or, you can request that a network administrator change the account's password for you.

3. The old password is saved with the configuration of the services and must manually be changed. Follow the steps in the appropriate section here, based on your operating system version, to update the passwords:
