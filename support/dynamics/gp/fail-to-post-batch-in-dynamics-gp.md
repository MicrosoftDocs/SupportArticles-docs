# Error when you try to post a batch in Microsoft Dynamics GP: "The stored procedure glpPostBatch returned the following results: DBMS: 0, Great Plains: 20286"

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when you post a batch in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 898996

## Symptoms

When you try to post a batch in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you receive the following error message:

> The stored procedure glpPostBatch returned the following results: DBMS: 0, Great Plains: 20286  
glpPostBatch. Select on Batch_Headers failed.

## Cause

This problem occurs for one of the following reasons:

- Posting Definitions Master table (SY00500) is corrupted.
- Missing or damaged stored procedure for 'dbo.glpPostBatch'.
- Missing trigger on the SY00500 table after rebuilding it.
- Stuck record in the SY00800/SY00801 activity tables in Dynamics database.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> Before you follow the instructions in this article, make sure that you have a complete backup copy of the database that you can restore if a problem occurs.

To resolve this problem, re-create the **Posting Definitions Master** table (SY00500). To do this, you can use either of two options. The steps in [Option 1: Use file maintenance](#option-1-use-file-maintenance) delete all batch records that are in the Posting Definitions Master table. The steps in [Option 2: Use the free toolkit from Professional Services Tools Library](#option-2-use-the-free-toolkit-from-professional-services-tools-library) keep the existing batch records by using the Professional Services Tools Library (PSTL) tool. This tool will help you re-create the Posting Definition Master table and re-create the stored procedures and the auto procedures without losing data.

Additionally, you may have to re-create a trigger that is advised by Toolkit. (see Option 3).

### Option 3

After rebuilding the SY00500 table, check to see if the 'glpBatchHeadersDeletetrigger' exists on the table. If not, script it out from a working install to recreate it.

```sql
sp_helptrigger sy00500
```

### Option 4: Have all users log completely out of Dynamics GP and clear out the activity tables

These tables should be empty when all users are out.

```sql
SELECT * FROM DYNAMICS..ACTIVITY --shows users currently logged into GP
SELECT * FROM DYNAMICS..SY00800
SELECT * FROM DYNAMICS..SY00801
SELECT * FROM TEMPDB..DEX_LOCK
SELECT * FROM TEMPDB..DEX_SESSION

DELETE DYNAMICS..ACTIVITY
DELETE DYNAMICS..SY00800
DELETE DYNAMICS..SY00801
DELETE TEMPDB..DEX_LOCK
DELETE TEMPDB..DEX_SESSION
```
