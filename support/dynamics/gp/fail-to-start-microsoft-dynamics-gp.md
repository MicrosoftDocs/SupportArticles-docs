# Error message when you start Microsoft Dynamics GP: Database setup has not been completed for Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article help fixes an issue that occurs when you start Microsoft Dynamics GP after you update to Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 915472

## Symptoms

When you start Microsoft Dynamics GP, you receive the following error message:

> Database setup has not been completed for Microsoft Dynamics GP. Use Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities to complete the database setup before starting Microsoft Dynamics GP.

This problem occurs after you perform a new installation of Microsoft Dynamics GP, after you update to Microsoft Dynamics GP, or after you install a new client computer.

## Cause 1

This problem occurs because a subfeature was installed. However, Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities must first be run to create the tables for this subfeature. To resolve this problem, see [Resolution 1](#resolution-1).

## Cause 2

This problem occurs because not all the subfeatures are updated. To resolve this problem, see [Resolution 2](#resolution-2).

## Cause 3

This problem occurs because not all the subfeatures that are installed on the new client computer are installed on the server. To resolve this problem, see [Resolution 3](#resolution-3).

## Cause 4

This problem occurs because the DynUtils.set file has been modified and does not contain all features shown in the Dynamics.set file or through Add or Remove programs. To resolve this problem, see [Resolution 4](#resolution-4).

## Resolution 1

On the server that is running Microsoft SQL Server, make sure that the subfeature is installed. Then, start Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities to create the tables for the subfeature.

## Resolution 2

On the server that is running SQL Server, start Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities. Then, update the subfeatures.

## Resolution 3

Compare the Dynamics.set files on the new client computer to the files on the server. Verify that any subfeatures that are installed on the client computer are also installed on the server. You can install subfeatures on the server or remove them from the client computer by using the **Add or Remove Programs or Programs and Features** item in Control Panel. To remove the subfeature, use the **Add or Remove Programs or Programs and Features** item on the client computer. This will remove the feature from the Dynamics.set files and from the Dynutil.set files. This will also remove the dictionary files from the Microsoft Dynamics GP installation folder and from any registry entries for the subfeatures.

> [!NOTE]
> If the module cannot be installed from Microsoft Dynamics GP CD 1, these steps may vary.

### Remove the subfeature from the client computer

1. Click **Start**, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
2. Double-click **Add or Remove Programs or Programs and Features**, click **Microsoft Dynamics GP**, and then click **Change**.
3. In the Program Maintenance window, click **Add/Remove Features**.
4. In the Select Features window, click the symbol next to the module that you want to remove, and then click **Do not install feature**.
5. Use the appropriate method:

    - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013, Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 and in Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, confirm that the **Install Location** field is correct, and then click **Next**.
    - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, confirm that the **Install to** field is correct, and then click **Next**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You must confirm that the field is correct because the folder in the field is the folder to which the changes will be made.
6. In the Install Program window, click **Install**.
7. When the Installation Complete window opens, click **Finish**.

    Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities should start. If Microsoft Dynamics GP Utilities does not start, click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft Dynamics**, and then click **GP Utilities**.
