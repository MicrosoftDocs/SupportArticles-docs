## More information

1. Use the appropriate method:

   - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Customize**, and then click **Report Writer**.
   - In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 and earlier versions, point to **Customize** on the **Tools** menu, and then click **Report Writer**.

   - In Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, click **Great Plains** in the **Product** list, and then click **OK**.

3. Click **Reports**.

5. In the **Modified Reports** area, click **Check with Stub on Top and Bottom - Graphical**, and then click **Open**.
6. Click **Layout**.
7. Drag the **PH** section to make it larger. Make sure that the size of the page header is 324. The size is displayed in the lower-left corner of the Toolbox window when you click the page header.
8. Move the following fields from the **F2** section to the **PH** section:

   - **Vendor Check Name**  
   - **Vendor Address Line 1**  
   - **Vendor Address Line 2**  
   - **Vendor Address Line 3**  
   - **Calc Date**  
   - **Check Total**  
   - **Calc String 1**  
   - **Calc String 2**  
   - **Calc String 3**

9. Double-click each address field that you moved to the **PH** section, and then change the address data type from **Last Occurrence** to **Data**.
10. Move the following fields from the top of the **PH** section to the bottom of the **PH** section:

    - **Vendor ID**  
    - **Vendor Check Name**  
    - **Payment Number**  
    - **Document Date**

11. Make sure that the size of the **F2** section is 60. The size is displayed in the lower-left corner in the Toolbox window when you click the **F2** section. Make sure that the **F2** section contains the following fields:
