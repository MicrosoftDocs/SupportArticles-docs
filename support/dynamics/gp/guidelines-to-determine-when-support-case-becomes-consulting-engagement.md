# Guidelines that Dynamics Retail Support Professionals use to determine when a support case becomes a consulting engagement

This article introduces the guidelines that Microsoft Dynamics Retail Support Professionals use to determine when a support case becomes a consulting engagement.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2768124

## Customization requests

- Reports
  - Before you submit a Support Request, you may want to check whether the report that you are looking for is available in the Microsoft Dynamics Retail Reports and Receipts Library.
  - Requests are reviewed for feasibility and work effort to determine whether it will require a consulting engagement.
  - Typically, we can perform customizations within the scope of a traditional support request; but this is limited to the following:
    - One table-join
    - Up to six column adds

    > [!NOTE]
    > Report customization requests that require additional work will be referred to your partner to see whether they want to perform the service. If the partner cannot perform the service, a consulting engagement will be required.
- Receipts
  - Before you submit a Support Request, you may want to check to see whether the receipt that you are looking for is available in the Microsoft Dynamics Retail Reports and Receipts Library.
  - Requests are reviewed for feasibility and work effort to determine whether it will require a consulting engagement.
  - All receipt template variables must be listed in the RMS Customization Guide.
  - Typically, we can perform customizations within the scope of a traditional support request; but this is limited to the following:
    - One receipt template section
    - Up to three changes per section

    > [!NOTE]
    > Receipt customization requests that require additional work will be referred to your partner to see whether they want to perform the service. If the partner cannot perform the service, a consulting engagement will be required.
- HTML Status Bars
  - Requests will be reviewed for feasibility and work effort to determine whether it will require a consulting engagement.
  - One change per HTML status bar request.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because of the complexity of customizing the HTML code, we are frequently not able to provide these customizations in a traditional support request. If this is the case, we would refer you to your partner to see whether they want to perform the service. If the partner cannot perform the service, a consulting engagement will be required.

- Net Display Receipts
  - Requests will be reviewed for feasibility and work effort to determine whether it will require a consulting engagement.
  - One change per Net Display Receipt request.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Because of the complexity of customizing the HTML code, we are frequently not able to provide these customizations in a traditional support request. If this is the case, we would refer you to your partner to see whether they want to perform the service. If the partner cannot perform the service, a consulting engagement will be required.

## Data related issues

- Corruption
  - Any repair attempt that relates to database corruption identified through Database Check or Database Re-index must be addressed through a consulting engagement.
- Incorrectly Formed or Orphaned Data
  - These requests can typically be handled with a support request to the Microsoft Dynamics Retail Support team.
  - If it is determined that the issue requires extensive effort or senior level resources to resolve the issue, a consulting engagement may be necessary.

## Training and walkthrough assistance

All training and walkthrough requests are handled through the partner or a consulting engagement.

## Non-RMS or non-POS support

- Microsoft Dynamics Retail Support Engineers will verify applicable settings and configuration within the Microsoft Retail software are accurately set.
- Any issues related to point of sale software other than Microsoft Dynamics RMS or Microsoft Dynamics POS 2009 will be referred to the appropriate supporting party, and the service request will be archived at that point.
- The following are issues that may be referred to a more appropriate resource:
  - Third-Party add-ins/customizations
    - Banks
    - Credit/Debit card processors
    - Add-ins
    - Plug-ins Etc.
  - Hardware Devices
  - Other Microsoft Products
- We encourage you to consult with your Certified Microsoft RMS Partner for support of non-RMS or non-POS related software and hardware questions as they have in many cases tested the software or hardware already.
