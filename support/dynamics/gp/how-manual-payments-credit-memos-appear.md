# Information about how manual payments, credit memos, and returns appear on the check stub when you run the Select Checks process in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how manual payments, credit memos, and returns appear on the Payables Management check stub.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 860395

## Introduction

This article also describes when the manual payments, credit memos, and returns are removed from the PM20000 table and from the PM20100 table when you run the **Select Checks** process to pay outstanding vendor invoices in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains.

## More information

The Payables Management check stub displays the following information:

- Invoices that are paid by a manual payment, a credit memo, or a return are displayed with a $0 remittance amount.
- Manual payments, credit memos, and returns are displayed with a negative value and with a $0.00 remittance amount.
- Invoices that are paid by a check are displayed with the appropriate remittance amount.

Manual payment, credit memo, and return information isn't printed on the computer check posting journal reports. During the posting process, the following vendor records are removed from the PM20000 (PM Transaction Open File) table and from the PM20100 (PM Apply To OPEN OPEN Temporary File) table:

- Invoices that are paid in full during the **Select Checks** process
- Manual payments, credit memos, and returns that are applied to invoices
- Invoices that are paid in full by manual payments, credit memos, and returns

The following example shows how manual payments, credit memos, and returns are displayed on the Payables Management check stub. The following example also shows when records are removed from the PM20000 table and from the PM20100 table during the **Select Checks** process.
