# How to add the employee name to the Checkbook Register Report in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to add the employee name to the Checkbook Register Report in Microsoft Dynamics GP. To do this, replace the Payroll Check field with the Employee Name field in the Checkbook Register Report.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 865514

## More information

To change the Checkbook Register Report in Report Writer so that the Employee name field replaces the Payroll check field, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> In many business practices, the accounting administrator may not want the individual in charge of Bank Reconciliation to see how much other employees are earning. If the employee name was displayed in Bank Reconciliation for each payroll check, employee confidentiality would be lost.
