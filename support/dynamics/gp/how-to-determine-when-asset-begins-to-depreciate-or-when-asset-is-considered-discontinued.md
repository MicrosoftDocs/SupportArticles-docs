### Full Year

Assets that use the Full Year value in the **Averaging Convention** field and a value in the **Place in Service Date** field in the first half of the year receive the full yearly amount of depreciation beginning from the value in the **Place in Service Date** field. Assets that use a value in the **Place in Service Date** field in the second half of the year receive half of the yearly amount of depreciation beginning from the value in the **Place in Service Date** field.

Assets that use a date in the **Retirement Date** field during the first half of the year are considered discontinued on the last day of the earlier year. Assets that use a date in the **Retirement Date** field during the second half of the year are considered discontinued on the last day of the first half of the year.

### Half Year Convention

An asset that uses the Half Year Convention value in the **Averaging Convention** field begins to depreciate on the date in the **Place in Service Date** field. However, in the first year of the asset's life and in the last year of the asset's life, only half of the yearly depreciation rate is considered. The asset does not depreciate after the first half of its final year. For example, an asset that uses the Half Year Convention has a yearly depreciation rate of $800. $400 is calculated the first year whether the date in the **Place in Service Date** field is 1/1 or is 12/15.

The asset also is considered discontinued on the last day of the first half of the year of retirement. Depreciation is considered or is backed out accordingly. If an asset is discontinued in the first year of its life, no depreciation is considered.

### Modified Half Year Convention

An asset that uses the Modified Half Year Convention value in the **Averaging Convention** field and a value in the **Place in Service Date** field in the first half of the year begins to depreciate on the first day of the year.

If the date in the **Retirement Date** field is in the first half of the year, the asset is considered discontinued on the last day of the earlier year. If the date in the **Retirement Date** field is in the second half of the year, the asset is considered discontinued on the last day of the year.

An asset that uses the Mid-Quarter value in the **Averaging Convention** field and a value in the **Place in Service Date** field at any time in the quarter begins to depreciate on the middle day of the second month of the quarter in the **Place in Service Date** field.

Assets that are discontinued during the quarter are considered discontinued on the middle day of the second month of the quarter in the **Retirement Date** field.

If the value in the **Place in Service Date** field is in the second half of the month (day 16 through the end of the month), the asset begins to depreciate on the first day of the next month.

If the date in the **Retirement Date** field is in the first half of the month (day 1 through day 15), the asset is considered discontinued on the last day of the earlier month. If the date in the **Retirement Date** field is in the second half of the month (day 16 through the end of the month), the asset is considered discontinued on the last day of the month.
