   - Method 1: SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE2000)

     Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Administrator Console**, and then select **Support Administrator Console**.
   - Method 2: SQL Server 2000

     Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then select **Query Analyzer**.
   - Method 3: SQL Server 2005

     Select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005**, and then select **SQL Server Management Studio**.
   - Method 4: SQL Server 2008
