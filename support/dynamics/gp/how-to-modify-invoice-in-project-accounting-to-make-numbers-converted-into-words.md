# How to modify an invoice to make numbers converted into words and shown at the bottom of "PA Invoice Format Project Detail Page 1"

This article describes how to modify an invoice in Project Accounting in Microsoft Dynamics GP so that numbers are converted to words and then displayed at the bottom of the PA Invoice Format Project Detail Page 1 report in Project Accounting.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 920825

## More information

You can use a script that contains the `RW_ConvertToWordsAndNumbers` function to convert the numbers to words and then display the words at the bottom of the report. This function has three parameters:

- *in currency IN_Value*: In this parameter, you set the currency value.
- *in string IN_Currency*  In this parameter, you set the currency ID for the currency. If you use a functional currency, leave this parameter blank.
- *in integer IN_Mode*: In this parameter, any value that is not zero causes the report to use words and numbers instead of only words.

### Step 1 - Back up and then open the report
