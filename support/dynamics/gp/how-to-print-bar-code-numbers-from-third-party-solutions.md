# How to print bar-code numbers from third-party solutions in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes the general guidelines about how to print bar-code number fields in reports in Microsoft Dynamics GP or in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0. The bar-code numbers are printed from the third-party solutions for bar coding that are listed under the Industry Solutions section of PartnerSource and of CustomerSource.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 856450

> [!NOTE]
> You must have administrator user rights or access to Report Writer to follow these steps.

## Prerequisites for printing bar-code numbers

1. You must install a bar-code package that includes fonts on each workstation where you want to print reports. You can buy bar-code fonts, or you can download free bar-code fonts from the Internet.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We do not have a list of compatible bar-code formats. Therefore, you must perform test prints that use the bar-code font to make sure that the font is compatible with your printer.

2. The bar-code number must be recorded somewhere in the Microsoft Dynamics GP system. For example, if you are assigning a bar-code number to each item, you can use the following fields:
    - **Item Number**
    - **Item Description**
    - **Item Short Description**

3. The report must have a table that includes the field that stores the bar-code number.
4. The report must have a graphical format in Report Writer.

5. Most bar-code readers expect a start character and an end character to identify the code field. The common practice is to use an asterisk `*` before and after the field. For example, item A must be entered as `*Item A*` so that the reader can decrypt the field.

## How to configure Microsoft Dynamics GP or Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains to print bar-code numbers

### Step 1 - Create a calculated field in Report Writer

You must create a calculated field in Report Writer to accept the bar codes. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Print the report to the screen, and then select **Modify** to open the Report Layout.
2. In the Toolbox, select **Calculated fields**, and then select **New**.
3. In the **New field** dialog box, type or select the following elements in the respective fields:

   - **Name**: Barcode_Field_Name
   - **Result Type**: **String**
   - **Expression Type**: **Calculated**

4. On the **Constants** tab, select the following elements, and then select **Add**:

    - **Type**: **String**
    - **Constant**: *
5. Select the **Cat** button.
6. On the **Functions** tab, select the following elements, and then select **Add**:

   - **Type**: **System-defined**
   - **Function**: **STRIP**

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **STRIP** function removes additional spaces in each field.

7. On the **Fields** tab, select the following elements, and then select **Add**:

    - **Resources**: Table_Name
    - **Field**: Field_Name

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the Table_Name place holder with the appropriate table name, and replace the Field_Name place holder with the appropriate field name that contains the bar code.

8. Select the **Cat** button.
9. On the **Constants** tab, select the following elements, and then select **Add**:

    - **Type**: **String**
    - **Constant**: `*`
10. The resulting calculated fields are displayed as follows:

    `"*" # Table_Name . Field_Name # "*"`
11. Select **OK**.
12. In the Toolbox, select **Calculated Fields**.
13. Drag the calculated field that you created to the appropriate area of the Report Layout.
14. On the **File** menu, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** or **Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains**. When you are prompted to save changes, select **Save**.
