## Method 1 - Change the printer settings

To print duplicate checks by changing the printer settings, follow these steps:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The order in which duplicate checks are printed depends on the collation settings of the printer. By default, most printers print duplicate checks in the following order:  
> 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...
>
> However, on HP Mopier printers, collation can be turned off so that duplicate checks are printed without being collated. That is, duplicate checks can be printed in the following order:  
> 1, 2, 3, ..., 1, 2, 3, ...
