### Examples

For the following examples, the employee is assigned the following:

- The Hourly pay code at a rate of $2.00.
- The Reported Tips pay code.
- The Minimum Wage Balance pay code at a rate of $5.50.
Business Expense pay is not included in Minimum Wage Balance nor is Retro-Active pay calculation.

#### Example 1

An employee receives a pay rate that is equal to minimum wage during training. The pay rate in the Hourly pay code is set to a wage of $5.50 and therefore no Minimum Wage balance is calculated or appears on the pay stub.

#### Example 2

An employee has worked 40 hours during the week. A transaction is entered for the Hourly pay code for 40 hours. The build finds that the minimum pay of $220 won't be met by using the transactions that were created. So, the employee pay stub includes the Hourly pay code at $80.00, and the Minimum Wage Balance pay code at $140 ($220-$80). The calculated gross wages for the employee are $220.00.

#### Example 3

An employee has worked 40 hours during the week. The employee received $100 in tips. A transaction is entered for the Hourly pay code at 40 hours and the Reported Tips pay code at $100.00. The build finds that the minimum pay of $220 won't be met by using the transactions that were created, and calculates a Minimum Wage balance of $40. Therefore, the employee pay stub includes the Hourly pay code at $80.00 and the Reported Tip pay code at $100.00, and a Minimum Wage balance of $40. The calculated gross wages for the employee are $120.00 ($80+$40).

#### Example 4

An employee has worked 40 hours during the week. The employee received $200 in tips. A transaction entry is created for the Hourly pay code at 40 hours and the Reported Tips pay code at $200.00. The build finds that the minimum pay will be met by using the transactions that were created. Therefore, the employee pay stub includes the Hourly pay code at $80.00 and the Reported Tip pay code at $200.00. The calculated gross wages for the employee are $80.00.
