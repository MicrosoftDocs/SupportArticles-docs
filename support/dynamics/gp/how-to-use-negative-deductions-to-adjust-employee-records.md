To use negative deductions to adjust employee records, follow these steps:

1. If a deduction was entered for an incorrect period, create a negative manual check for the deduction in the Payroll Manual Check-Adjustment Entry window. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Transactions** menu, point to **Payroll**, and then select **Manual Checks**.
    2. In the **Check Type** area, select **Manual Check**.
    3. Leave the **Batch ID** field blank.
    4. Change the date in the **Check Date** field to the check date from the pay run in which the deduction was originally withheld incorrectly.
    5. In the **Check Number** field, use the default check number, or type the check number that you want to use.
    6. In the **Employee ID** field, enter the employee ID.
    7. Select **Transactions**.
    8. In the Payroll Manual Check Transaction Entry window, select **Deduction** in the **Transaction Type** drop-down list, and then enter the deduction code that you want to update in the **Code** field.
    9. In the **Date From** field, enter an appropriate date.
    10. In the **Date To** field, enter an appropriate date.
    11. In the **Amount** field, type the amount that you want to adjust for the deduction.
    12. Select **Save**.
    13. Close the Payroll Manual Check Transaction Entry window.
    14. In the Payroll Manual Check-Adjustment Entry window, select **Post**.

2. Create a second manual check for a positive adjustment by using the posting date in which the deduction should have been taken. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Transactions** menu, point to **Payroll**, and then select **Manual Checks**.
    2. In the **Check Type** area, select **Manual Check**.
    3. In the **Check Date** field, enter the check date in which the deduction should have been taken.
    4. In the **Check Number** field, use the default check number, or type the check number that you want to use.
    5. In the **Employee ID** field, enter the employee ID.
    6. Select **Transactions**.
    7. In the Payroll Manual Check Transaction Entry window, select **Deduction** in the **Transaction Type** drop-down list, and then enter the deduction code that you want to update in the **Code** field.
    8. In the **Date From** field, enter an appropriate date.
    9. In the **Date To** field, enter an appropriate date.
    10. In the **Amount** field, type the amount that you want to adjust for the deduction.
    11. Select **Save**.
