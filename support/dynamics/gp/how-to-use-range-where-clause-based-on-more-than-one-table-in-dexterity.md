# How to use a "Range Where" clause that is based on more than one table in Dexterity in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to use a Range Where clause that is based on more than one table. You can use this kind of Range Where clause in Dexterity in Microsoft Dynamics GP. The Range Where clause allows for a Where clause to be passed to Microsoft SQL Server. This lets you use the Range Where clause to restrict the records that are returned by SQL Server to Dexterity.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 922056

Typically, you use the Range Where clause only to work with columns that are in the same table. This limitation exists because the Range Where clause does not support joins in SQL Server. Therefore, you must use a sub query when you want to use a Range Where clause on more than one table.

When you use a sub query, you can set up a Range Where clause that is based on more than one table. You can do this only when the additional tables are fully qualified.

The following sample Range Where clause restricts the Sales Order Processing Header table so that Dexterity can only display the transactions for one class of customer.

```console
inout table SOP_HDR_WORK;
in 'Class ID' IN_Class_ID;

local text l_where_clause;

pragma(disable warning LiteralStringUsed);

clear l_where_clause;
l_where_clause = l_where_clause + physicalname('Customer Number' of table SOP_HDR_WORK) + CH_SPACE + "in" + CH_SPACE + CH_LEFTPAREN;

{ Create Subquery }
l_where_clause = l_where_clause + "select" + CH_SPACE + physicalname('Customer Number' of table RM_Customer_MSTR) + CH_SPACE;
l_where_clause = l_where_clause + "from" + CH_SPACE + 'Intercompany ID' of globals + CH_PERIOD + SQL_DEFAULT_OWNER + CH_PERIOD;
l_where_clause = l_where_clause + physicalname(table RM_Customer_MSTR) + CH_SPACE;
l_where_clause = l_where_clause + "where" + CH_SPACE + physicalname('Customer Class' of table RM_Customer_MSTR) + CH_SPACE;
l_where_clause = l_where_clause+ CH_EQUAL + CH_SPACE + SQL_FormatStrings(IN_Class_ID) + CH_SPACE;

l_where_clause = l_where_clause + CH_RIGHTPAREN;

pragma(enable warning LiteralStringUsed);

range table SOP_HDR_WORK where l_where_clause;
```

Additionally, the following sample line adds a Where clause to the end of each table command that is sent from Dexterity to SQL Server. The sample line uses a class of `DEFAULT` together with the TWO demonstration database.

```sql
WHERE CUSTNMBR in (select CUSTNMBR from TWO.dbo.RM00101 where CUSTCLAS = 'DEFAULT' )
```
