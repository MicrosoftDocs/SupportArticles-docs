# Importing data into the Human Resources module in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article contains a summary of the options to import data in to the Human Resources module in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2856302

## SQL Server Import

You can use the *SQL Server Import and Export Wizard* to import/append a SQL table from an Excel spreadsheet and it works for HR tables as well. In SQL Server Management Studio, right-click on the company database, and select **Tasks** and select **Import Data...** to open the wizard.

For more information about the SQL Server Data Transformation Services, see [The SQL Server Import and Export Wizard how-to guide](https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/feature/The-SQL-Server-Import-and-Export-Wizard-how-to-guide).

## Table Import

Currently an option is to use Table Import to import data into the HR windows. Information on the window may be held in the SDK.

To gather information on importing into Microsoft Dynamics GP, you can refer to [How to use Table Import to import data into Microsoft Dynamics GP](use-table-import-to-import-data-into-dynamics-gp.md).

## eConnect

## Integration Manager

Integration Manager doesn't support importing information/data directly into the Human Resource module. Within Integration Manager, there's no destination available for Human Resource as it is considered a third party add-on within the Microsoft Dynamics GP system. So Integration Manager doesn't have a supported option to bring in transaction data into HR. However, you could use some of the Integration Manager features with Payroll to bring in some of the setup information as follows:

- Integration Manager could be used to bring in Employee Master Data directly into Payroll. Human Resources Management reads directly from the Payroll Employee Master data table (UPR00100) from Payroll.
- The main setup for Benefits and Deductions could be brought into Payroll with Integration Manager, and then use the HR Reconcile utility in Microsoft Dynamics GP to bring this setup data over to HR. There are HR Reconcile options for **Update Benefit Setup** and **Update Benefit Enrollment** to update HR with benefit/deduction setup and enrollment from the corresponding codes in Payroll.
