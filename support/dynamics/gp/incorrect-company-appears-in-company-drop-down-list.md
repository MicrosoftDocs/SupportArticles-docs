# An incorrect company appears in the Company drop-down list when you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides a solution to an issue where an incorrect company appears in the **Company** drop-down list when you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 968058

## Symptoms

When you try to log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP or Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, an incorrect company appears in the **Company** drop-down list in the Company Login window. The incorrect company is either a duplicate of your company or a company that does not exist.

## Cause

This problem occurs because a duplicate record or an invalid record refers to the companies in the tables in the DYNAMICS database.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1

If the incorrect company is a company that does not exist or a duplicate of an invalid company, use this method.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The following ClearCompanys.sql script is a script to remove all entries in the DYNAMICS database that refer to the databases that no longer exist on the computer that is running Microsoft SQL Server.
> - Before you run this script to remove the company database from the tables in the DYNAMICS database, you must remove the company database from the computer that is running SQL Server.
> - Before you use this method, make sure that you have a complete backup copy of the database so that you can restore the database if a problem occurs.

To use this method, run the ClearCompanies.sql script to remove incorrect records that refer to companies from the DYNAMICS database. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start the Support Administrator Console, Microsoft SQL Query Analyzer, or SQL Server Management Studio. To do this, use one of the following methods depending on the program that you are using.

    - Method 1: For SQL Server Desktop Engine

        If you are using SQL Server Desktop Engine (also known as MSDE 2000), start the Support Administrator Console. To do this, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Administrator Console**, and then click **Support Administrator Console**.

    - Method 2: For SQL Server 2000

        If you are using SQL Server 2000, start SQL Query Analyzer. To do this, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then click **Query Analyzer**.

    - Method 3: For SQL Server 2005

        If you are using SQL Server 2005, start SQL Server Management Studio. To do this, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.

    - Method 4: For SQL Server 2008

        If you are using SQL Server 2008, start SQL Management Studio. to do this, click **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2008**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.

    while (@@FETCH_STATUS <>-1)
    begin
    
    exec (@dbname)
    FETCH NEXT from dbname_Cleanup into @dbname
    
    end
    
    DEALLOCATE dbname_Cleanup
    GO
    set nocount on
    
    /* Remove all stranded references from the other Business Alerts table that do not exist in table SY40500. */
    delete SY40502 where BARULEID NOT IN (SELECT BARULEID FROM SY40500)
