## Introduction

This article describes the changes to the eConnect Fixed Asset adapter in Integration Manager from Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 to Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0.

## More Information

In Integration Manager for Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, the **Account Group ID** field is available to be mapped.

In Integration Manager for Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, the **Account Group ID** field is unavailable to be mapped.

The following information describes how the Fixed Asset adapter will function based on the field mappings:

- The FA00400 (Asset Account Master) table will be updated according to the following scenarios:

  - If the **Asset Class ID** is set up to have a default **Account Group ID**, the Asset Group ID will update the FA00400 table.
  - If the **Asset Class ID** is set up **without** a default **Account Group ID,** the FA00400 table will be updated with the company account default settings.

- The eConnect adapter is configured to roll down the class ID information to the asset.

- The adapter does not let you change the **Account Group ID** during the integration.

- The adapter ignores the information in the Book Setup window. The adapter uses the Fixed Assets Company Setup window, and adds all the books to the asset.
