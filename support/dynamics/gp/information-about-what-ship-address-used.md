If an address does not exist for the site that is used on the purchase order, the company address that is assigned in the **Company Setup** dialog box is used. To see the company address, use one of the following methods:

- In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Company**, and then click **Company**.

- In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 and in earlier versions, point to **Setup** on the **Tools** menu, point to **Company**, and then click **Company**.

1.
