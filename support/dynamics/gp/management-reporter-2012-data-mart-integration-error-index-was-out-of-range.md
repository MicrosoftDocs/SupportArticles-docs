This error message can also occur when you attempt to open a building block or generate a report.

## Cause

This error can occur if there are references to accounts in the account segment table (GL40200) of the Microsoft Dynamics GP application database that are not present in the Account setup table (SY00300) or the Account index table (GL00100).

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> Before you follow the instructions in this article, make sure that you have a complete backup copy of the database that you can restore if a problem occurs.

1. Run the following query in SQL Management Studio against the Microsoft Dynamics GP company database to identify the invalid account segments:

    ```sql
    select * from GL40200 where SGMTNUMB not in (select SGMTNUMB from SY00300)
    select * from GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=1 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_1 from GL00100)
    select * from GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=2 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_2 from GL00100)
    select * from GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=3 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_3 from GL00100)
    select * from GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=4 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_4 from GL00100)
    ```

    Depending on the number of segments, you may need to adjust the statement.

2. Run the following statements in SQL to delete the bad records from the GL40200 table:

    ```sql
    delete GL40200 where SGMTNUMB not in (select SGMTNUMB from SY00300)
    delete GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=1 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_1 from GL00100)
    delete GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=2 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_2 from GL00100)
    delete GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=3 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_3 from GL00100)
    delete GL40200 where SGMTNUMB=4 and SGMNTID not in (select distinct ACTNUMBR_4 from GL00100)
    ```

3. After removing the records from the GL40200 table, run Check Links on the account master in Microsoft Dynamics GP:

    1. Select **Dynamics GP**, then select **Maintenance** and then select **Check Links**.
    2. Select **Financial** series. Select **Account Master**, select **Insert** and then select **OK**.

4. Reconfigure the Management Reporter Data Mart integration to a new data mart database after correcting the account segments.
