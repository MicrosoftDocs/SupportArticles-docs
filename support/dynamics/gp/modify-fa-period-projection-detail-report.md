# How to modify the Fixed Assets Period Projection - Detail report to prevent pre-projection amounts from being displayed in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to modify the Fixed Assets Period Projection - Detail report in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0 to prevent pre-projection amounts from being displayed in the report.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 915101

## Introduction

In Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, when you run the Fixed Assets Period Projection - Detail report, you enter a date range. You can enter a date range that includes dates after the Depreciated to Date of the asset. If you do it, pre-projection amounts are displayed for the dates that aren't included in the date range. These pre-projection amounts aren't actual depreciation amounts. Instead, these pre-projection amounts are an estimate that is calculated by the project routine.
