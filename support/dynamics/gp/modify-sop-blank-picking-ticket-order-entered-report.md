## Introduction

This article describes how to print more than four lines of line item comments on the Sales Order Processing (SOP) Blank Picking Ticket Order Entered report in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

The SOP Blank Picking Ticket Order Entered report replaces the SOP Blank Picking Ticket report that was used in earlier versions because the Advanced Picking features were added in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0. Standard users still have access to the SOP Blank Picking Ticket in Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 and Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0.
