# A negative allocated quantity in Inventory Control is displayed in the Item Quantities Maintenance window in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article provides a solution to an issue where a negative allocated quantity appears in the Item Quantities Maintenance window.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 850365

## Symptoms

A negative allocated quantity appears in the Item Quantities Maintenance window in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

Allocated quantity is defined by the following equation:

On hand quantity - quantity available = quantity allocated

## Cause

The quantity fields in the Item Quantities Maintenance window are populated from the quantity fields in the Item Quantity Master table. A negative allocated quantity does not occur when Microsoft Dynamics GP works as designed. However, there several scenarios where this issue may occur, including the following scenarios:

- Transactions have been imported incorrectly.
- A third-party product has affected posting.
- A posting interruption has occurred and the Item Quantity Master table was updated incorrectly.

## Resolution

To correct the negative allocated quantities, use the reconcile utility. To use the reconcile utility, follow the appropriate steps in the following modules:
