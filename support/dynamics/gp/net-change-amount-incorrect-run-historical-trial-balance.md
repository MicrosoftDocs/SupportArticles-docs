# The net change amount is incorrect when you run the Historical Trial Balance report in Microsoft

This article helps you work around the problem that occurs when you run the Historical Trial Balance report in Microsoft.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 863465

## Symptoms

When you run the Historical Trial Balance report in Microsoft Dynamics GP or in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, the net change amount is incorrect. This problem occurs if the value in the **Subtotal By** field is **Period**.

When this problem occurs, the net change amount in the report does not match the net change amount in the Historical Summary window.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, follow these steps.

### Step 1: Change the Net Change Sub field by using the Report Writer

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Print the report again by setting the report destination to **Screen**.
2. In the report, click **Modify** to open the Report Writer.
3. In the Report Layout window, double-click in the **Net Change Sub** field in the **F2** section.
4. In the Reports Field Options window, click **Last Occurrence** in the **Display Type** pane.
5. Close the Report Layout window, and then click **Yes** when you are prompted to save the changes.
6. On the **File** menu, click **Microsoft Dynamics GP** or **Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains**.

### Step 2: Grant access to the report

If you use Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, follow these steps:

1. Create an identifier (ID) to print the changed report. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. On the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Tools**, point to **Setup**, point to **System**, and then click **Alternate/Modified Forms and Reports**. If you are prompted for the system password, type the system password.

    1. Expand **Financial**, expand **Trial Balance History Per Period**, and then click **Microsoft Dynamics GP (Modified)**.
    1. Click **Save**.
2. Assign the security to print the changed report to the ID. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. On the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Tools**, point to **Setup**, point to **System**, and then click **User Security**. If you are prompted for the system password, type the system password.
    1. In the **User** field, enter the user account that you use.
    1. In the **Company** field, enter the company that you use.
    1. Click the drop-down arrow in the **Alternate/Modified Forms and Reports ID** field, and then click the ID that you created in step 1.
    1. Click **Save**.

If you use Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 or Microsoft Great Plains 8.0, use one of the following methods.
