## Cause

This issue occurs when you remove an integration source file before you remove the query relationship.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Remove all the integration sources on the integration except the main source.

2. Add one source back to the integration.

3. Open the Relationships window, and then set the relationship.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all the sources are on the integration and until the relationship is linked.
