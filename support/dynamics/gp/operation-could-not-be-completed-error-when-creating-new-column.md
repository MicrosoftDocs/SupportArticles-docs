## Cause

A currency is missing the ISO code in Microsoft Dynamics GP. The error will only occur with the Dynamics GP Data Mart.

## Resolution

You must enter an ISO code for all currencies within Microsoft Dynamics GP in the Currency Setup window. For more information about how to set up currencies in Microsoft Dynamics GP, you will have to contact the Microsoft Dynamics GP Financials support team.

After you have the currencies set up in with the ISO codes, you must reconfigure the Microsoft Dynamics GP Data Mart integration. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Start the MR Configuration Console.
2. Under **ERP Integrations**, select the Dynamics GP Data Mart integration.
3. Select **Remove** to remove the integration.
4. In SQL Management Studio, delete the DDM database.
5. In the MR Configuration Console, select **File** and then select **Configure**.
6. Select **Add Microsoft Dynamics GP Data Mart** and then select **Next**.
7. Enter the required information and complete the wizard.
