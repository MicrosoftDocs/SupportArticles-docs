# "The operation could not be completed" error when you restore a Microsoft Management Reporter 2012 database

This article provides a resolution for the **The operation could not be completed** that may occur when you restore a Microsoft Management Reporter 2012 database.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Management Reporter 2012, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2009, Microsoft Dynamics SL 2011, Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2744330

## Symptoms

After you restore a Management Reporter 2012 database, you may receive the following error in the Management Reporter 2012 Report Designer:

> The operation could not be completed due to a failure on the server.

Error message that is received in the Windows Event Viewer Application log:

> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): Please create a master key in the database or open the master key in the session before performing this operation.The 'pEncryptGeneralUserData' procedure attempted to return a status of NULL, which is not allowed. A status of 0 will be returned instead.

## Cause

The Management Reporter 2012 database is encrypted by using server-specific information, and cannot be backed up/restored without additional steps.

## Resolution

The process for moving the Management Reporter 2012 database is as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a Management Reporter 2012 provider that uses the Dynamic Datamart (DDM) database, do not move the DDM database. Instead, a new database will be created by using the process here.

1. Start the Management Reporter 2012 Configuration Console.
2. Select **Management Reporter Services**.
3. Record the name of the database listed under the Database connection heading. The database name will be listed after the SQL server name. For example: SQLServer (Database)
4. Record the name of the Service Account that is used.
5. Sign in to SQL Server Management Studio.
6. Back up the Management Reporter 2012 database recorded earlier in this topic.
7. Start the Management Reporter 2012 Report Designer.
8. Export each building block group. The reports can be reimported if a failure were to occur. You can do this by following these steps:

    1. Under the **Company** menu, select **Building Block Groups**.
    2. Select the building block group to export.
    3. Select **Export**.
    4. Select all building blocks to be exported on the Report Definitions, Row Definitions, Column Definitions, Reporting Tree Definitions tabs. Also, select all Dimension Value Sets.
    5. Select **Export**.
    6. Choose a location to save the `.tdbx` export file.

       > [!NOTE]
       > The default path on a Windows Server 2008 server is C:\Users\\*\<username>*\Documents\Management Reporter\Building Block Groups

    7. Select **Close** on the Building Block Groups window.

9. Exit Management Reporter 2012 Report Designer.
10. Start the Management Reporter 2012 Configuration Console.
11. In the navigation bar, select the name of the SQL server.
12. Select Remove to remove the ERP integration.
13. Select **Yes** to the prompt **Are you sure you want to remove the ERP Integration?**.
14. In the navigation bar, select **Management Reporter Services**.
15. Select **Remove Process Service**.
16. Select **Yes** to the prompt **Are you sure you want to remove 'Management Reporter 2012 Process Service'?**.
17. Select **Remove Application Service**.
18. Select **Yes** to the prompt **Are you sure you want to remove 'Management Reporter 2012 Application Service'?**.
19. Sign in to SQL Server Management Studio.
20. Back up the Management Reporter 2012 database recorded earlier in this topic.
21. Sign in to SQL Server Management Studio on the *new* SQL server.
22. Restore the Management Reporter 2012 database on the *new* SQL server.
23. Verify that the Management Reporter 2012 service account has the correct permissions on the SQL server and to the new database. Refer to the Management Reporter installation guides at [Management Reporter 2012 for Microsoft Dynamics ERP: Installation, Migration, and Configuration Guides](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=5916).

24. Using the instructions here, run the following script against the Management Reporter 2012 database on the new SQL server:

    ```sql
    --////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    -- 
    -- Script Instructions:
    -- 
    -- 1. Update the line in the following code, starting with 'CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD', to contain the 
    -- Master key you wish to use. The master key must meet the Windows password policy 
    -- requirements of the computer that is running the instance of SQL Server.
    --
    -- 2. Run this script against the Management Reporter 2012 database. This script
    -- will output a message if it does not detect the Management Reporter 2012 database.
