When you try to change or add a user in Microsoft Management Reporter, you receive the following error message:

> The operation could not be completed due to a failure on the server

## Cause

Cause 1

The Active Directory user does not have a display name. See Resolution 1 in the Resolution section.

Cause 2 - only applies to Management Reporter 2012

## Resolution

Resolution 1

In Active Directory, the user does not have a display name. The user must have a display name for Management Reporter Security to work correctly.

2. Select Management Reporter Services in the left navigation pane.

    1. Select **Remove Application Service** and then choose **Yes**.
    2. Select **Remove Process Service** and then choose **Yes**.

3. To reinstall both services, select **File** and then select **Configure**.

    1. Mark only the Management Reporter Application Service and the Management Reporter Process Service, and then select **Next**.
    2. In the Service account section, select the **Account** drop-down, choose **NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE** or use a dedicated domain\username account with the proper permissions.
    3. Complete the remaining sections and then select **Next**.
    4. Select **Configure** to add both services.
