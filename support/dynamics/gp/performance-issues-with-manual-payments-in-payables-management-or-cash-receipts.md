## Resolution

Use one of the methods below to remove the Payment Document Management module:

Method 1: Use **Add/Remove Programs** in the Control Panel to remove the Payment Document Management module from your Microsoft Dynamics GP installation.

Method 2: You can manually remove the Payment Document Management module from the Dynamics.set file in GP as follows:

1. Exit Microsoft Dynamics GP.
2. Navigate to the GP Code folder. The default location is: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Dynamics\GP.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The navigation path may be slightly different than listed above, depending on where Microsoft Dynamics GP was installed.

3. Right-click on the Dynamics.set file and make a copy of it for safe-keeping.
4. Right-click on the Dynamics.set file and open it with Notepad.
5. The number in line 1 is a total of how many modules are installed, so decrement it by one. (For example, if the number in line 1 is 15, make it 14.)
6. In the module list, remove these two lines:

   2150  
   Payment Document Management

7. In the bottom section, remove the three lines below pointing to the dictionaries for this module:

   > [!NOTE]
   > The navigation path may be slightly different and should match where you found the GP code folder in step 2.

    :C:Program Files/Microsoft Dynamics/GP/PMNTDOC.DIC  
    :C:Program Files/Microsoft Dynamics/GP/2150FRM.DIC  
    :C:Program Files/Microsoft Dynamics/GP/2150RPT.DIC
  
8. Exit out of the Dynamics.set file and save the changes.
9. Restart Microsoft Dynamics GP and test again.

## More information

The Payment Document Management module was created specifically for countries/regions that use other payment methods other than cash, check or credit card, such as Spain and some other Latin American, Middle Eastern or European countries/regions. This module will change the functionality of payment windows in Payables Management and Receivables Management. Most US installs do not use this module.
