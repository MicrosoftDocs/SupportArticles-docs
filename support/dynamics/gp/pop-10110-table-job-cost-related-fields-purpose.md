# Description of the purpose of the job-cost-related fields in the POP10110 (Purchase Order Line) table in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes the purpose of the job-cost-related fields in the POP10110 (Purchase Order Line) table in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 930345

The following job-cost-related fields are stored in the POP10110 table:

- JOBNUMBER
- COSTCODE
- COSTTYPE

These fields aren't used by Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 or by Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0. These fields are reserved for third-party applications. Job Costing for the Manufacturing series in Microsoft Dynamics GP doesn't update these fields.
