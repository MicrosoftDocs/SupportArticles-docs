Posting account is not set up for benefit expense.  
Posting account is not set up for benefit payable.  
Posting account is not set up for pay code.  
Posting account is not set up for gross pay.  
Posting account is not set up for federal tax withholding.  
Posting account is not set up for state tax withholding.  
Posting account is not set up for taxable benefit expense.  
Posting account is not set up for taxable benefit payable.

  You can also try to run the **check links** process against the Account Master file in the Financial series.

> [!NOTE]
> These payroll account types should have a **Job** value and a **Department** value of **ALL**. This condition makes sure that no departments or jobs are missed or are added later. Even if a job and a department are set up for all the listed payroll account types, the generic **ALL ALL** types must also exist.
