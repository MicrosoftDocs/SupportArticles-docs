    **Method 3: For SQL Server 2008**

    If you're using SQL Server 2008, start SQL Server Management Studio. To do it, click **Start**, point to **All Programs** > **Microsoft SQL Server 2008**, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.  

4. Run the following statement against the company database to remove the zero dollar remittances in Payables Management.

    ```console
    /* The following code is used to remove zero dollar remittances for a specific vendor. */ 
    
    DELETE PM20100 
    WHERE VendorID = 'VendorID' 
    AND KeySourc = 'REMITTANCE'
    
    /* The following code is used to remove all zero dollar remittances. */ 
    
    DELETE PM20100 
    WHERE KeySourc = 'REMITTANCE'
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
