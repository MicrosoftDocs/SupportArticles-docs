# Frequently asked questions about the home pages and area pages features in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about home pages and area pages in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 918313

## Introduction

This article contains answers to frequently asked questions about the home pages feature and the area pages feature that are included in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## Home pages in Microsoft Dynamics GP

- **Q1: What occurs when I select an industry and then select a role? Are the home pages different for the different industries?**

  A1: The default settings for home pages are the same regardless of the industry. However, home pages use specific industry information to provide a refined list of roles to the user. This refined list enables users to find applicable roles more easily.

- **Q2: After I select a home page role, can I change the role?**

  A2: Yes. In the upper-right corner of the home page, select **Customize this page**, and then select **Change Role**.

- **Q3: If I change roles, what information is removed?**

  A3: The home page layout is changed. This change includes the order of the areas on the home page and whether these areas are turned on or are turned off. Specifically, you experience the following behavior:

  - The **Microsoft Office Outlook** area, the **Quick Links** area, and the **Metrics** area are changed.
  - The **My Reports** area isn't changed.
  - Reminder settings for the new role are added to the **Reminders** area. However, existing reminders aren't removed.

- **Q4: What determines the timing of the home page refresh operation in Microsoft Dynamics GP? How does this timing affect resource usage?**

  A4: After a user logs on to Microsoft Dynamics GP, the home page refreshes every 60 minutes. Therefore, as long as all users do not log on at the same time, the refresh operation is staggered. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics performance isn't adversely affected.

  The amount of resources that are required for the home page depends on the options that are configured for a particular user. More reminders, tasks, and metrics on the home page require an increased amount of resources during the home page refresh operation. Metrics items are the most resource-intensive items.

- **Q5: If a user makes a change to a home page, are the settings for the particular role changed?**

  A5: No. When a user makes a change to a home page, the change only applies to that particular user.

- **Q6: Can the Administrator assign a role to all users?**

  A6: The Administrator can log on to Microsoft Dynamics GP as each user, and then select the role for each user. To log on by using each user ID, the Administrator must have the password for each user. The Administrator can also run the following script to automatically set the role for all users who do not have a role assigned. These users have the Blank home page assigned. This script also sets the options so that the home page doesn't display at logon, and the home page doesn't refresh after an hour.

    ```sql
    USE DYNAMICS
    set nocount on
    declare @Userid char(15)
    declare cDispHP cursor for  
    select A.USERID
    from SY01400 A left join SY08000 B on A.USERID = B.USERID
    where B.USERID is null or B.DISPHP <> 0
    open cDispHP
    while 1 = 1
    begin
    fetch next from cDispHP into @Userid
    if @@FETCH_STATUS <> 0 begin
    close cDispHP
    deallocate cDispHP
    break
    end
    
    if exists (select DISPHP from DYNAMICS.dbo.SY08000 where USERID = @Userid)
    begin
    print 'adjusting ' + @Userid
    update DYNAMICS.dbo.SY08000
    set DISPHP = 0
    where USERID = @Userid
    end
    else begin
    print 'adding ' + @Userid
    insert DYNAMICS.dbo.SY08000 ( USERID, DISPHP, REFRSHHP, User_Role )
    values ( @Userid, 0, 0, 121 )
    end
    end /* while */
    set nocount off
    ```

- **Q7: Can the Administrator lock down the home page so that users cannot customize it?**

  A7: The Administrator can revoke security access to the **Customize Home Page** dialog. This prevents users from customizing the home page and from customizing each area of the home page. Therefore, users cannot add an area to the home page. Also, users cannot remove an area from the home page.

  To revoke the security access in Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0, follow these steps:

    1. Select **Tools** > **Setup** > **System** > **Security**.
    2. In the **User ID** area, select the user ID.
    3. In the **Company** area, select the company database.
    4. In the **Type** area, select **Windows**.
    5. In the **Series** area, select **System**.
    6. Double-click **Customize Home Page** to remove access to the window.
    7. Select **OK**.

  To revoke the security access in Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 and Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, select **Tools** > **Setup** > **System** > **Security Tasks**.
    2. In the **Task ID** area, select the **DEFAULTUSER**.
    3. In the **Product** area, select **Microsoft Dynamics GP**.
    4. In the **Type** area, select **Windows**.
    5. In the **Series** area, select **System**.
    6. Clear the **Customize Home Page** checkbox to remove access to the window.
    7. Select **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, access to the **Customize Home Page** window is granted to the **DEFAULTUSER** security task. These steps revoke access to this window in the **DEFAULTUSER** security task. If another security task grants access to this window, you must follow these steps for that security task.

- **Q8: Can I create new roles for the home page?**

  A8: Yes. You can create new roles by using a Dexterity customization. For more information about how to create new roles, see the Integration Guide manual (_IG.pdf_) that's installed with Dexterity.

- **Q9: How can I disable the home page?**

  A9: See [How to disable the home page feature in Microsoft Dynamics GP](disable-home-page-features.md).

- **Q10: How do I disable the Microsoft Office Outlook content from the home page for all users?**

  A10: Run the following script from SQL Query Analyzer, from the Support Administrator Console, or from Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

    ```sql
    UPDATE A SET COLNUMBR = 0, SEQNUMBR = 0, Visible = 0 
    FROM DYNAMICS.dbo.SY08100 A WHERE (SectionID = 2) AND (DICTID = 0) AND ((COLNUMBR <> 0) OR (SEQNUMBR <> 0) OR (Visible <> 0))
    ```

- **Q11: How does the home page integrate with security?**

  A11: The **Quick Links** area, the **Reminders** area, the **My Reports** area, and the **Metrics** area integrate with the Microsoft Dynamics GP security. If a user doesn't have access to a window, that window isn't listed in the **Quick Links** area. If a user doesn't have access to the Reminder Smart List, the reminder isn't displayed in the **To Do** area. Also, the metrics that appear in the **Metrics** area are controlled by the window security settings.

- **Q12: If I change my home page role, are my security settings affected?**

  A12: No. When a user changes a role, only the default settings that Microsoft Dynamics GP creates for the user are changed. These default settings are then filtered according to the particular user's security settings.

- **Q13: Can I create new metrics, add to Quick Links, and add to My Reports for the home page?**

  A13: Yes. You can perform all these tasks by using a Dexterity customization. For more information about how to perform these tasks, see the Integration Guide manual (_IG.pdf_) that's installed with Dexterity.

- **Q14: If I click in the Metrics area, I can modify the displayed graph. However, when the home page is refreshed, my changes aren't saved. Can I save my changes to the metrics graph?**

  A14: Currently, you can't save changes to the graph in the **Metrics** area.

- **Q15: How is the SQL Server Reporting Services reports activated for the Microsoft Dynamics GP home page?**

  A15: In order to display the SQL Server Reporting Services reports in the Metrics part of the Microsoft Dynamics GP home page, you need to do the following:

    1. Use the SQL Server Reporting Services Wizard for Microsoft Dynamics GP to deploy the reports in the 'Charts and KPIs' series to your report site.
    2. Open the **Reporting Tools Setup** window in Microsoft Dynamics GP and enter the URL to your Report Server site in the SQL Server Reporting Services tab using the following format:

        `http://servername:port/ReportServer/ReportService2005.asmx`

       > [!NOTE]
       > You need to select the **Enable SQL Server Reporting Services Home Page Metrics** option in this window.

    3. Go to the home page and select **Customize this page...**.
    4. Select **Metrics**.
    5. Select the blue expansion button beside **Metrics** and select the SQL Server Reporting Services reports to list on your home page.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You will need permission to run these reports in SQL Server Reporting Services in order for them to display on the Microsoft Dynamics GP home page.

- **Q16: When I start Microsoft Dynamics GP on a terminal server, I receive the "The XML page cannot be displayed" error on the home page.**

  > Cannot view XML input using XSL style sheet. Please correct the error and then click the Refresh button, or try again later.
  >
  > Access is denied. Error processing resource 'file:///C:/Program Files/Microsoft Dynamics/GP/Background/HomePage.xsl'.

  What causes this error message?

  A16: This issue occurs if roaming profiles are configured for the users. Specifically, this issue occurs because of the way in which the user profile Temp folders are mapped. To resolve this issue, reconfigure the roaming profile to remove the Temp folder from the shared network location. A user's roaming profile must be configured to use the local computer's Temp folder. The roaming profile must not be configured to use a shared network location.

- **Q17: When I start the home page, "Metrics are not available because Microsoft Office Chart" error occurs in the Metrics.**

  A17: This problem is resolved. For more information, see [Error message when you view the home page in Microsoft Dynamics GP: "Metrics are not available because Microsoft Office Chart..."](fail-to-view-home-page.md).

- **Q18: When I start Microsoft Dynamics GP, the home page displays the XML code for the home page.**

  A18: To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

    1. Exit Microsoft Dynamics GP.
    2. Select **Start** > **Run**, type _cmd_ in the **Open** box, and then select **OK**.
    3. At the command prompt, type _regsvr32 MSXML3.dll_, and then press ENTER.
    4. Start Microsoft Dynamics GP.

    Additionally, make sure that the following items are installed on the computer on which you experience this issue:

  - The Microsoft Office Web Components

      > [!NOTE]
      > If you are running the 2007 Office programs, install the Office Web Components for Office 2003. If you are running Office 2000, install the Office Web Components for Office XP.

  - The latest version of the Microsoft XML Parser (MSXML)

    To obtain the latest version of MSXML, follow these steps:

    1. Visit the following Microsoft Web site: [Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/default.aspx).

    2. In the box to the right of the **Search** list, type _XML Parser_, and then select **Go**.

- **Q19: When I start Microsoft Dynamics GP, I may receive one or both of the following error messages:**

  - Error Message 1

    > An error has occurred in the script on this page. Line: **XXX** Char 6 Error Object doesn't support this property or method Code: 0 URL file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/ **XXX** /Local%20Settings/Temp/HomePage.xml Do you want to continue running scripts on this page?

  - Error Message 2

    > Metrics are not available because Microsoft Office Chart

  > [!NOTE]
  > Error Message 2 appears in the **Metrics** area.

  A19: This problem occurs when the Microsoft Office Web Components aren't installed. The Microsoft Office Web Components are required for the metric feature of the Microsoft Dynamics GP home page. If the computer has a Microsoft Office 2000 program or a Microsoft Office XP program installed, use the Office Web Components for Office XP. If the computer has a Microsoft Office 2003 program or a 2007 Microsoft Office program installed, use the Office Web Components for Office 2003.
