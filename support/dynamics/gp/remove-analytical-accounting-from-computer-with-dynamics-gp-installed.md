This article describes how to completely remove (uninstall) Analytical Accounting from a computer that has Microsoft Dynamics GP installed.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 915903

> [!NOTE]
> The steps below will remove Analytical Accounting from all companies, so you cannot use these steps if you are using AA in any of your companies (that use the same Dynamics database).

## How to completely remove Analytical Accounting

To completely remove Analytical Accounting, follow the appropriate steps for the version of Microsoft Dynamics GP that you are using:

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Historical AA tables were added in GP 10.0 so the scripts work for GP 10.0 and later versions.
> - Make sure to perform all 13 steps listed below. The last step is often missed.
> - If you wish to continue to use Analytical Accounting in one or more of your companies, then do not use the steps below. These steps will remove AA from *all* of the companies.

## Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0 and higher versions

11. Remove all AA SQL objects from COMPANY databases by [downloading the KB915903_10.sql script](https://mbs2.microsoft.com/fileexchange/?fileid=2dd9a8ed-cf8d-449c-b20b-23f012ec532d) and execute it against EACH company database.

12. Execute the scripts that you downloaded in steps 10 and 11.
    1. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server** version you have installed, and then click **SQL Server Management Studio**.

    5. Locate and then click the KB915903_AA_Remove_AAComplete_DYNAMICS_10.sql script file, and then run the script against the "DYNAMICS" database. To do this, click **DYNAMICS** in the database list, and then press F5.

13. Remove the Product ID for AA from the system tables. To do this, run the following statements against the DYNAMICS database in SQL Server Management Studio:

    ```sql
    Delete DB_Upgrade where PRODID='3180' Delete DU000020 where PRODID='3180'
    ```
