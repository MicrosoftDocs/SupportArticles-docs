### Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0

To remove and then delete the EFT batch that was voided, you must remove the batch from the CM20202 and CM20203 tables by using SQL Query Analyzer. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Start the Support Administrator Console, Microsoft SQL Query Analyzer, or SQL Server Management Studio. To do it, use one of the following methods depending on the program that you're using.

    - Method 1: For SQL Server Desktop Engine

        If you're using SQL Server Desktop Engine (also known as MSDE 2000), start the Support Administrator Console. To do it, select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft Administrator Console**, and then select **Support Administrator Console**.

    - Method 2: For SQL Server 2000

        If you're using SQL Server 2000, start SQL Query Analyzer. To do it, select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server**, and then select **Query Analyzer**.

    - Method 3: For SQL Server 2005

        If you're using SQL Server 2005, start SQL Server Management Studio. To do it, select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2005**, and then select **SQL Server Management Studio**.  

2. In the Query pane, enter the following SELECT statements. Make a note of the numeric value of the DEX_ROW_ID column that is returned by the query.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM CM20202 
    SELECT * FROM CM20203 
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Verify that the returned results contain the batch ID of the batch that you want to delete.
3. Press F5 to run these statements.
4. Type the following DELETE statements.

    ```sql
    DELETE CM20203 where BACHNUMB = 'XXX'
    DELETE CM20202 where BACHNUMB = 'XXX'
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > In these statements, replace **nnn** with the batch ID of the batch that you want to delete.

2. In the **Query** pane, enter the following SELECT statements. Make a note of the numeric value of the DEX_ROW_ID column that is returned by the query.

    ```sql
    SELECT DEX_ROW_ID, * FROM ME234602 WHERE BACHNUMB = 'nnn'
    SELECT DEX_ROW_ID, * FROM ME234603 WHERE BACHNUMB = 'nnn'
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this statement, replace **nnn** with the batch ID of the batch that you want to delete.
3. Press F5 to run these statements.
4. Verify that the SELECT statements returned the appropriate batch.
5. Type the following DELETE statements.

    ```sql
    DELETE ME234602 WHERE DEX_ROW_ID = 'nn'
    DELETE ME234603 WHERE DEX_ROW_ID = 'nn'
