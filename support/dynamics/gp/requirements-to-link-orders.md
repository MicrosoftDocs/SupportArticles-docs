## Requirements to link a Purchase Order line item to a Sales Order Document line item

1. The **Allow Sales Documents Commitments** check box is selected in the **Purchase Order Entry** window.
2. Documents in Sales Order Processing that can be linked to a purchase order:

    - **Order**

        The sales line item must have a value in the **Qty to Back Order** field that is less than or equal to the **Quantity Available** in the **Sales Commitments for Purchase Order** window for the PO Line.
    - **Back Order**

        The sales line item must have a value in the **Qty Backordered** field that is less than or equal to the **Quantity Available** in the **Sales Commitments for Purchase Order** window for the PO Line.

3. The following fields must be the same for the Purchase Order line item and the Sales document line item. Which applies to both Inventory and Non-Inventory items and all Purchase order document types:
    - **Item Number**, or **Vendor Item Number** if you're using a Vendor Item Display in Purchase Order Processing Setup
    - **U of M**
    - **Site ID**
4. For **drop-ship** purchase orders, the following special requirements apply:
    - The **Customer ID** assigned to the drop-ship PO must be the same as the **Customer ID** assigned to the sales document.
    - The sales order line item must be marked as **drop-ship**.- The following fields must be the same for the purchase order line item and the sales line item:
        - **Shipping Method**
        - **Ship To Address ID**
        - **The Ship to Address ID address details** can't be edited on either the purchase order line or the sales line item. An indicator is placed next to the Ship to Address ID when the details are changed.  
5. For **Blanket** or **Drop-Ship Blanket** Purchase Orders, the control line item cannot be linked to sales order documents. However, the other blanket items can be linked.
