# "Run-time error '1008': Unsafe Operation" error when you expand a scrolling window by using VBA

This article provides a resolution for the run-time error 1008 that occurs when you expand a scrolling window by using VBA in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 951231

## Symptoms

When you use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0 to automatically expand a scrolling window (also known as a grid in VBA), you receive the following error message:

> Run-time error '1008': Unsafe Operation. An attempt was made to set a value into an application field which is disabled. This operation could compromise the integrity of the application.

## Cause

This error occurs if the visible icon for expanding the scrolling window is a non-editable visual switch field that only contains an image. VBA does not allow for the value of a non-editable field to be changed.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use a hidden push button field that is overlaid with the same size and position as the visual switch icon field.
