## More Information

To set up an adjusting period in General Ledger in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Historical periods cannot be changed.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Company**, and then select **Fiscal Periods**.
2. Set up each fiscal period. To do it, see the steps in the following example.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This example assumes that the fiscal year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 and that the fiscal year has a 13th adjusting period.

    1. In the **Year** list, select a year. For example, select **2013**.
    2. In the **First Day** field, type a first day for the fiscal period. For example, type **01/01/2013**.
    3. In the **Last Day** field, type a last day for the fiscal period. For example, type **12/31/2013**.
    4. In the **Number of Periods** field, type the number of periods for the fiscal year. For example, type **13**.
    5. Select **Calculate**.
    6. If it's necessary, adjust the start dates of the periods. In this example, type dates in the **Date** column beside the corresponding entry in the **Period Name** column as indicated in the following list:
        - Period 1: 01/01/2013
        - Period 2: 02/01/2013

        - Period 6: 06/01/2013
        - Period 7: 07/01/2013
        - Period 8: 08/01/2013
        - Period 9: 09/01/2013
        - Period 10: 10/01/2013
        - Period 11: 11/01/2013
        - Period 12: 12/01/2013
        - Period 13: 12/31/2013

4. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Utilities**, point to **Financial**, and then select **Reconcile**.
5. Select the **Year** check box.
