# Steps to add Prospect BILL TO address on the SOP Blank Quote form in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article introduces the steps to add Prospect BILL TO address on the SOP Blank Quote form in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3091374

Prospects do not have multiple Address ID information as a regular Customer does. If you look at the Customer card, you will notice that separate fields are provided for Ship To, Bill To, and Statement To addresses. Prospects only have one main address.

Regular Customer's Bill To Addresses are pulled in from the Customer Address MSTR table. Prospects do not have records stored in this table. As such, separate calculated fields were created to make the Bill To Address 1 and Bill To Address fields print on Quote Forms. See the following calculated fields in Report Writer:

(C) Bill To Address 1  
(C) Bill To Address 2

We will need to create the following fields to make the City, State, and Zip print on the SOP Blank Quote Form:

(C) Bill To City  
(C) Bill To State  
(C) Bill To Zip
