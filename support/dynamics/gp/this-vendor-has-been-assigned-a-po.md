1. Open the Receivings Transaction Entry window: Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Receivings Transaction Entry**.

2. Select a Shipment and the Vendor you would like to receive the purchase order against.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also select **Shipment/Invoice** and then skip steps 5-7 below.

3. On the line for PO Number, pull up the open purchase order in question and enter the line items that are on the purchase order onto this Shipment/Invoice for receiving.

4. Select **Post**. It will process the Receivings Transaction. Now the purchase order will have a Received status.

5. Next, create an Invoice in Purchase Invoice Entry: Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Enter/Match Invoice**. Let the Receipt Number default in. Enter the Vendor Doc. Number for Payables Management and enter the Vendor ID for the purchase order we just received against.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't want to invoice the purchase order, you can go to Edit Purchase Order Status window: Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Edit Purchase Orders**, pull up the purchase order and close the purchase order manually.

6. Enter the PO Number on the line and the line items related.

7. Select **Post**. It will process the Purchase Invoice. Now the purchase order will have a Closed status.

8. Once the purchase order is closed, you can move the purchase order to history in the Remove Completed Purchase Orders window: Select **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Tools**, point to **Routines**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Remove Completed Purchase Orders**.

After doing these steps you can then inactive the Vendor by selecting **Cards**, then **Purchasing** and then select **Vendor** to change the status drop-down from Active to Inactive.

1. Open the Receiving Transaction Entry window: Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Receivings Transaction Entry**.

2. Select the **Lookup** button next to **Receipt No.** It will display the unposted receipts.

5. Repeat this same step for any unposted invoices in the Purchasing Invoice Entry window: Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, select **Enter/Match Invoices**.

After doing these steps you can then inactive the Vendor by selecting **Cards**, then **Purchasing** and then select **Vendor** to change the status drop-down from Active to Inactive.
