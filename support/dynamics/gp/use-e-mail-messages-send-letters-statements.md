# Use e-mail messages to send letters, statements, and invoices to customers in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to set up a query and use it to send letters, statements, and invoices by using e-mail messages.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 903690

## Introduction

This article describes how to use e-mail messages to send letters, statements, and invoices to many customers in Microsoft Dynamics GP. You can set up a query and then use the Collections Management query letters (third party product)Â to send these items.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need Collections Management installed in order to send letters, statements and invoices to customers in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

## More information

To use e-mail messages to send letters, statements, and invoices, follow these steps:

1. Create a letter, statement, or invoice.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you intend to send letters, statements, or invoices in Portable Document Format (PDF), Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader must be installed.

2. Set up Microsoft Dynamics GP to send e-mail messages to the status recipient. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP 10.0, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Setup**, point to **Sales**, and then select **Receivables**.

      In Microsoft Dynamics GP 9.0 and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains 8.0, point to **Setup** on the **Tools** menu, point to **Sales**, and then select **Receivables**.

   2. In the Receivables Management Setup window, enter an e-mail address in the **Status Recipient** box, and then select **OK**.

      > [!NOTE]
      > This e-mail address belongs to the person who will use e-mail messages to send statements to customers.

   3. Point to **Sales** on the **Cards** menu, and then select **Customer**. In the **Customer ID** field, type a customer ID.
   4. In the Customer Maintenance window, select **Options**.
   5. In the Customer Maintenance Options window, select to select the **Send E-mail Statements** check box, and then enter an e-mail address in the **To** box. The **CC** and **BCC** boxes are optional.
   6. Select **OK**.

3. Set up a query for all customers. To do this, follow these steps: (In GP 2013 and later versions, you need to purchase and install 'Collections Management' to do build queries and query letters. This is a third-party add-on product.)

   1. Point to **Sales** on the **Transactions** menu, and then select **Build Query**. (If you have the Collections Management module installed. This is a third-party module.)
   2. In the Collections Management Build Query window, enter the required information in the **Query ID** and **Description** boxes.
   3. On the **Customer** tab, select to select the type of query in the **Customer** box, and then select the range by using the **From** and the **To** boxes.

      For example, if you want to select all customers, select to select the first customer in the **From** box, and then select to select the last customer in the **To** box.

   4. Select **Insert** to insert the range.
   5. Repeat steps 2a through step 2d if you want to add other ranges for this query.
   6. Select **Save**.

4. Use the query to send the letters, statements, or invoices. To do this, follow these steps:

   1. Point to **Sales** on the **Transactions** menu, and then select **Query Letters**. (If you have the Collections Management module installed. This is a third-party party module.)
   2. Select to select one or more of the following check boxes:

      - Print Letters
      - Print Statements
      - Print Invoices

   3. Select **Print**.
   4. In the Collections Management Query Actions window, select **Email**. The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft.
