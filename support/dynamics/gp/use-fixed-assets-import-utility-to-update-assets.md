# You can use the Fixed Assets Import utility to update assets in Microsoft Dynamics GP

You can use the Fixed Assets Import utility to update assets in Microsoft Dynamics GP and in Microsoft Business Solutions - Great Plains.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 850554

You can use the Fixed Assets Import utility to update assets in Microsoft Dynamics GP if the Window Identifier, the Asset ID, and the Asset Suffix of the assets match the information that has already been entered in Fixed Assets. However, you cannot update book information.

Use the import process to import changes to assets that already exist in Fixed Assets. This is helpful if you want to change fields that do not exist in the Fixed Assets Mass Change window.
