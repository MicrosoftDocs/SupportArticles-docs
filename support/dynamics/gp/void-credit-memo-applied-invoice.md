# Void a credit memo that is applied incorrectly to an invoice in Payables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP

This article describes how to correct a situation where a credit memo is applied incorrectly to an invoice in Payables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics GP  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 953223

## Introduction

Sometimes credit memos are applied incorrectly to an invoice. This can occur manually when you apply a credit memo to a specific invoice, and then discover that the credit memo should have been applied to a different invoice. This can also occur automatically when you perform a check run with the option to automatically apply existing unapplied credit memos. In addition, frequently users incorrectly assume that when a check is voided, the credit memos are automatically unapplied.

## A credit memo is fully applied to a single invoice or to multiple invoices

1. On the **Transactions** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Void Historical Transactions**.
2. In the **Void Historical Payables Transactions** window, select the **Void** checkbox for the credit memo that you want to void.
3. Select **Void**.
4. When you are prompted to print posting journals, select the appropriate destination, and then select **OK**.
5. Close the **Void Historical Payables Transactions** window.
