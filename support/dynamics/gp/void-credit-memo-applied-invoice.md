## Introduction

Sometimes credit memos are applied incorrectly to an invoice. This can occur manually when you apply a credit memo to a specific invoice, and then discover that the credit memo should have been applied to a different invoice. This can also occur automatically when you perform a check run with the option to automatically apply existing unapplied credit memos. In addition, frequently users incorrectly assume that when a check is voided, the credit memos are automatically unapplied.

2. In the Void Historical Payables Transactions window, click to select the **Void** check box for the credit memo that you want to void.
