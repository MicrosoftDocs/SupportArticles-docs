## Detailed information for each step in the year-end checklist

The following steps are detailed information for the year-end checklist.

### Step 1: Post all transactions for the year

Post all transactions for the year before you close the year. If you want to enter future period transactions before you close the year, create a new batch for the future period transactions. Save the future period transactions in the new batch, but don't post the new batch until after the year has been closed.

The following areas of Microsoft Dynamics GP aren't date-sensitive:

- The **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window
- SmartList objects
- Vendor Summary reports

These areas of Microsoft Dynamics GP will be incorrect if you don't close the payables year after you enter all current year transactions and before you enter any transactions for the new year. However, the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window is editable. So you can update the information in the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window if it's required.

To access the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window, follow these steps:

1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Summary**.
2. In the **Vendor Credit Summary** window, type a vendor ID in the **Vendor ID** field, and then select **Yearly**.
3. In the **Summary View** list, select **Amounts Since Last Close**.

To view the SmartList columns that are affected, follow these steps:

1. Open SmartList. To do it in Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **SmartList** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu.
2. Expand the **Purchasing** node, and then select **Vendors**.
3. Select **Columns**.
4. Select **Add**.
5. Select the following fields in the **Available Columns** list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The items flagged with an asterisk are affected by the calendar year-end close. All other items are affected by the fiscal year-end close.

      - **1099 Amount YTD**
      - **1099 Amount LYR**
      - **Amount Billed YTD**
      - **Amount Billed LYR**
      - **Amount Paid YTD**
      - **Amount Paid LYR**
      - **Average Days To Pay - Year**
      - **Discount Available LYR**
      - **Discount Available YTD**
      - **Discount Lost LYR**
      - **Discount Lost YTD**
      - **Discount Taken LYR**
      - **Discount Taken YTD**
      - **Finance Charge LYR**
      - **Finance Charge YTD**
      - **Number of Finance Charges LYR**
      - **Number of Finance Charges YTD**
      - **Number of Invoice LYR**
      - **Number of Invoice YTD**
      - **Number of Paid Invoice YTD**
      - **Returns LYR**
      - **Returns YTD**
      - **Trade Discounts Taken LYR**
      - **Trade Discounts Taken YTD**
      - **Withholding LYR**
      - **Withholding YTD**
      - **Write Offs LYR**
      - **Write Offs YTD**

6. Select **OK**.
7. Select **OK**.

To view the Vendor Summary reports, follow these steps:

1. On the **Reports** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Analysis**.
2. In the **Reports** list, select **Calendar Year**.
3. In the **Options** list, select an option, and then select **Print**.

### Step 2: Print the Aged Trial Balance with Options report

We recommend that you print a paper copy of the Aged Trial Balance with Options report to keep with your year-end permanent financial records. To do it, follow these steps:

1. On the **Reports** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Trial Balance**.
2. In the **Reports** list, select **Aged Trial Balance with Options**.

### Step 3: Print the Vendor Period Analysis report

We recommend that you print a paper copy of the Vendor Period Analysis report to keep with your year-end permanent financial records. To do it, follow these steps:

1. On the **Reports** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Analysis**.
2. In the **Reports** list, select **Period**.

### Step 4: Install the year-end update (optional)

If there are compliance changes for Payables Management, such as 1099 form changes, install the year-end update. If there are no changes or compliance issues for the tax year for Payables Management, you can skip this step.

Review the changes that are included in the Payroll year-end update.

### Step 5: Make a backup that is named "Pre-1099 Edits"

Create a backup, and then put the backup in safe, permanent storage. A backup gives you a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year, and this backup can be restored later if it's required. A backup lets you recover data quickly if a power fluctuation or other problem occurs during the year-end closing procedure.

To create a backup in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, and then select **Backup**.
2. In the **Company Name** list, select your company name.
3. Change the path of the backup file if it's required, and then select **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you name this backup "Pre-1099 Edits" to differentiate it from your other backups.

### Step 6: Verify the 1099 information and edit it if it's required

To print the 1099 edit list, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Routines** > **Purchasing**, and then select **Print 1099**.

2. Enter the Company Information and Address ID.

3. Select the printer icon in the upper-right corner to print the 1099 edit list. Review for accuracy.

4. If you need to edit any 1099 information, use one of the following methods. Method 1 is recommended for Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013 and later versions. Method 1 and Method 2 are also illustrated in [Editing made EASY for 1099s in Microsoft Dynamics GP](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=487c4288-7473-47de-a4e7-221c26a2adc6).

**Method 1:** (Recommended) Edit 1099 Transaction details (Applies to Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013 and later versions)

1. Select **Transactions**, point to **Purchasing**, and select **Edit 1099 Transaction Information**.

2. Select the appropriate Vendor ID. (Only vendors set to be 1099able are displayed in the window.)

3. You can restrict by Voucher Number, by Document Number, or by Date, if wanted.

4. Select if you want 1099 Debit Transactions, **All Debit Transactions**, or **All Credit Transactions**.

5. The vendor's transaction detail populates in the bottom of the window. For each transaction, you can edit the **Tax Type**, **Box Number**, and **Amount** on open and historical transactions.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You may not enter a larger 1099 amount than the total amount of the document.

6. Select **Process** to have the changes made and the 1099 is updated.

**Method 2:** Mark the vendor correctly

If you mark a vendor as 1099able and shouldn't have, or you forget to mark a vendor as 1099able at all, you can use the **Update 1099 Information** utility to change the 1099 status on the vendor and also to update the 1099 information. You can change a 1099 vendor to be non-1099 or vice versa.

1. Select **Tools** under **Microsoft Dynamics GP**, point to **Utilities** > **Purchasing**, and select **Update 1099 Information**.

2. Mark the bullet for Vendor and 1099 Transactions.

3. In the **FROM** and **TO** sections, enter the following content:

    - _To change a vendor to be 1099able:_ select **Not a 1099 Vendor** in the **FROM** section, and select the appropriate 1099 type of Dividend, Interest or Miscellaneous, and the appropriate 1099 Box number in the **TO** section. (Miscellaneous and Box 7 Nonemployee Compensation is the most common.)

    - _To change a vendor to not be 1099able_: Select the current Tax Type and 1099 Box Number that is selected on the **Vendor Maintenance Options** window for the vendor in the **FROM** section, and select **Not a 1099 Vendor** in the **TO** section.

    *If **Not a 1099 Vendor** isn't an option in the drop-down lists, then either you aren't on a GP version later than Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013, or you didn't select Vendor and 1099 Transactions as instructed in step 2.

4. Use the Range restriction to restrict to the Vendor ID that you wish to change and select **INSERT**.

5. Select **Process**. The vendor status is updated on the **Vendor Maintenance Options** window, and the 1099 information is updated appropriately. You can use the **1099 Details** window (see Method 1) to verify.

**Method 3:** Edit the 1099 directly (Use for Microsoft Dynamics GP 2010 and prior versions, but can work for all versions.)

> [!NOTE]
> The Reconcile utility for 1099 amounts would undo any edits you make using this method.

1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **1099 Details**.

2. In the **Vendor ID** list, select a vendor ID.

3. In the **Tax Type** list, select one of the following:

    - **Dividend**
    - **Interest**
    - **Miscellaneous**

4. In the **Display** area, select **Month** or **Year**, and then type _20XX_ in the **Year** field. (Enter the wished year for the _20XX_ placeholder.)

5. In the **Amount** column, type the correct 1099 amount. Select **Save**.

**Method 4:** Edit the 1099 directly

> [!NOTE]
> The Reconcile utility for 1099 amounts would undo any edits you make using this method.

1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Summary**.

2. In the **Vendor ID** list, select a vendor ID, and then select **Period**.

3. In the **Year** field, type _20XX_. (Enter the wished year for the _20XX_ placeholder.)

4. In the **Month/Period** field, select the appropriate month or period.

5. Select the **1099 Details** blue expansion button that appears next to the **1099 Amount** field. The **1099 Details** window opens.

6. In the **Amount** column, type the correct 1099 amount for the respective box.

7. Press **Save**. Exist out of the remaining windows.

### Step 7: Print the 1099 statements

> [!NOTE]
> You can print the 1099 statements at any time.

To print the 1099 statements, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Routines** > **Purchasing**, and then select **Print 1099**.
2. In the **1099 Year** field, type _20XX_. (Enter the year for the _20XX_ placeholder.)
3. Each of your 1099 report types must be printed separately. In the **Print 1099** window, select the options that you want in the **1099 Type** field and in the **1099 Box Number** field, and then select **Print**.

The following table provides additional information about the fields on the 1099 form and where this information can be located in Microsoft Dynamics GP.

|Field|The window where data is located|
|---|---|
|Payers name, street address, city, state, and ZIP Code/Postal Code|The **Print 1099** window|
|Payers Federal Identification number|The **Print 1099** window|
|Recipients name, address, and Zip Code/Postal Code| The **Primary Address** of the **Vendor Maintenance** window|
|Recipients identification number| The **Tax ID** field of the **Vendor Maintenance Options** window|
|Amounts for boxes 1-9 on the Dividend Form or 1-16 on the Miscellaneous Form| The **1099 Amount** field in the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window|
  
Microsoft Dynamics GP doesn't handle electronic filing for 1099s. For more information, see [more options to prepare for the 1099 electronic submission](https://community.dynamics.com/blogs/post/?postid=2246f6af-3f2a-4faf-9da5-544613326c20).

### Step 8: Make a backup that is named "Pre Year-End"

Create a backup, and then put the backup in safe, permanent storage. A backup gives you a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year, and this backup can be restored later if it's required. A backup lets you recover data quickly if a power fluctuation or other problem occurs during the year-end closing procedure.

To create a backup in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, and then select **Backup**.
2. In the **Company Name** list, select your company name.
3. Change the path of the backup file if it's required, and then select **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you name this backup "Pre Year-End" to differentiate it from your other backups.

### Step 9: Close the year

To close the year, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Routines** > **Purchasing**, and then select **Year-End Close**.
2. If you're closing both your fiscal and calendar year at the same time, select **All**. If you just close your calendar year, select **Calendar**. If you just close your fiscal year, select **Fiscal**.
3. Select the **Print Report** checkbox, and then select **Close Year**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you keep a paper copy of the year-end report together with your permanent year-end audit records.

To view the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window, follow these steps:

1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Purchasing**, and then select **Summary**.
2. In the **Vendor ID** field, type a vendor ID to view, and then select **Yearly**.

**The calendar year details**

The calendar year-end process in Microsoft Dynamics GP clears the **1099 Amount Year to Date** field and then transfer the amount to the **1099 Amount Last Year** field for the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window.

**The fiscal year details**

The fiscal year-end process in Microsoft Dynamics GP clears the following fields:

- **Amount Billed YTD**
- **Amount Paid YTD**
- **Average Days To Pay - Year**
- **Discount Available YTD**
- **Discount Lost YTD**
- **Discount Taken YTD**
- **Finance Charge YTD**
- **Number of Finance Charges YTD**
- **Number of Invoice YTD**
- **Number of Paid Invoice YTD**
- **Returns YTD**
- **Trade Discounts Taken YTD**
- **Withholding YTD**
- **Write Offs YTD**

The amounts in these fields will also be updated in the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window:

- **Amount Billed LYR**
- **Amount Paid LYR**
- **Discount Available LYR**
- **Discount Lost LYR**
- **Discount Taken LYR**
- **Finance Charge LYR**
- **Number of Finance Charges LYR**
- **Number of Invoice LYR**
- **Returns LYR**
- **Trade Discounts Taken LYR**
- **Withholding LYR**
- **Write Offs LYR**

### Step 10: Close the fiscal periods

You can use the **Fiscal Periods Setup** window to close any fiscal periods that are still open for the year. It prevents users from accidentally posting transactions to the wrong period or year. Verify that you've posted all transactions for the period and the year for all modules before closing fiscal periods. If you must later post transactions to a fiscal period that you've already closed, you can return to the **Fiscal Periods Setup** window to reopen the period before you can post a transaction.

To close a fiscal period, follow these steps:

1. Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, point to **Setup** > **Company**, and then select **Fiscal Periods**.
2. Select the **Purchasing** checkbox for the **Period** that you must close.

### Step 11: Close the tax year

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure should only be completed after you have completed the year-end closing procedures for all sales and purchasing modules.

To close the tax year, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Routines** > **Company**, and then select **Tax Year-End Close**.
2. Select the **Close Year** checkbox and the **Print Report** checkbox.
3. Select **Process**. When you're prompted to continue with the year-end close. Select **Yes**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you keep a paper copy of the year-end report together with your permanent year-end audit records.

### Step 12: Make a backup that is named "Post Year-End"

Create a backup, and then put the backup in safe, permanent storage. A backup gives you a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year, and this backup can be restored later if it's required. A backup lets you recover data quickly if a power fluctuation or other problem occurs during the year-end closing procedure.

To create a backup in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, and then select **Backup**.
2. In the **Company Name** list, select your company name.
3. Change the path of the backup file if it's required, and then select **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you name this backup "Post Year-End" to differentiate it from your other backups.

### Frequently asked questions

Q1: Are inactive vendor records cleared during year-end closing? If not, how can inactive vendor records be removed?

A1: No, inactive vendor records aren't automatically removed. To remove an inactive vendor record, the following conditions must be true:

- No current year 1099 amounts exist for the vendor.
- The vendor has no documents in work or history.

To delete all inactive vendor records that fit these criteria, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Utilities** > **Purchasing**, and then select **Mass Vendor Delete**.
2. In the **Range** list, select **by Vendor Status**.
3. In the **From** list, select **Inactive**.
4. In the **To** list, select **Inactive**.
5. Select **Process**.

Q2: What should I do if I must issue a check on January 1 for the next year, but I'm not ready to close the current year yet?

A2: Print the checks, but don't _post_ them until after you process your year-end closing. If you must post the checks immediately, change the **Amount Paid** fields in the **Amounts Since Last Close** view of the **Vendor Yearly Summary** window.
