Before you close a fiscal period, verify that you've posted all transactions for the period and for the year for all modules. To later post a transaction to a fiscal period that you've closed, you must first reopen the period in the **Fiscal Periods Setup** window.

To lock down posting in a fiscal period, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Payroll** check box for each **Period** that you close.

1. In the **Authorization Number** field, type your authorization number, and then select **Log in**.
