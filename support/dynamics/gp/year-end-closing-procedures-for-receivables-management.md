## Summary

> [!NOTE]
> Before you follow the instructions in this article, make sure that you have a complete backup copy of the database that you can restore if a problem occurs.

This article describes the recommended year-end closing procedures for Receivables Management in Microsoft Dynamics GP. Read this article before you do one or more of the procedures.

## Year-end closing checklist

You can use this checklist for the end of the fiscal year and for the end of the calendar year.

> [!NOTE]
> Although Receivables Management is date sensitive, the following items are updated based on the closing of Receivables Management:
>
> - The SmartList objects
> - The Receivables Management summary reports
> - The Amounts Since Last Close view in the Customer Summary window

So we recommend that you follow these steps so that the SmartList objects, the Receivables Management summary reports, and the Amounts Since Last Close view contain the correct information:

1. [Post all the sales and receivables transactions for the year.](#step-1-post-all-the-sales-and-receivables-transactions-for-the-year)
1. [Make a pre-year-end closing backup.](#step-2-make-a-pre-year-end-closing-backup)
1. [Close the year.](#step-3-close-the-year)
1. [Close the fiscal periods. (This step is optional.)](#step-4-close-the-fiscal-periods-this-step-is-optional)
1. [Close the tax year.](#step-5-close-the-tax-year)
1. [Make a post-year-end closing backup.](#step-6-make-a-post-year-end-closing-backup)

### Step 1: Post all the sales and receivables transactions for the year

Post all the sales and receivables transactions for the year before you close the year. If you want to enter any sales and receivables transactions for a future period before you close the year, create a batch that contains the transactions. Next, save the batch. Then, post the batch after you close the year.

You must close the year because some areas of Microsoft Dynamics GP aren't date-sensitive. If you don't close the year after you enter all the current year transactions and before you enter transactions for the next year, these areas will contain incorrect information. However, if you have to change the information, you can change the information in the Amounts Since Last Close view in the Customer Summary window and in the Customer Finance Charge Summary window. The following areas are the areas of Microsoft Dynamics GP that aren't date-sensitive.

- The Amounts Since Last Close view in the Customer Summary window

  To open the Amounts Since Last Close view in the Customer Summary window, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Sales**, and then select **Summary**.
    2. In the Customer Summary window, type a customer ID in the **Customer ID** box.
    3. In the **Summary View** list, select **Amounts Since Last Close**.

- The Customer Finance Charge Summary window

  To open the Customer Finance Charge Summary window, follow these steps:

    1. On the **Cards** menu, point to **Sales**, and then select **Summary**.
    2. In the Customer Summary window, type a customer ID in the **Customer ID** field.
    3. Select **Finance Charges**.

- The SmartList objects

  To view the SmartList columns that are affected, follow these steps:

    1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, select **Columns** on the **Microsoft Dynamics GP** menu, select **SmartList**, expand **Sales**, expand **Customers**, and then select **Add**.

### Step 2: Make a pre-year-end closing backup

Create a backup before you close the year. Put the backup in safe, permanent storage. This backup makes sure that you've a permanent record of the company's financial position at the end of the year. You can restore information from this backup if you've to. For example, this backup would let you quickly recover if a power fluctuation or another problem occurred during the year-end close procedure.

To create a backup in Microsoft Dynamics GP, follow these steps:

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, and then select **Backup**.
2. In the Back Up Company window, select the company name in the **Company Name** list.
3. Change the path of the backup file if it's required, and then select **OK**.

### Step 3: Close the year

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Tools** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, point to **Routines**, point to **Sales**, and then select **Year-End Close**.
2. If you're closing both the fiscal year and the calendar year at the same time, select **All**. If you're closing only the calendar year, select **Calendar**. If you're closing only the fiscal year, select **Fiscal**.
3. Select the **Print Report** check box, and then select **Close Year**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > We recommend that you keep a paper copy of the year-end report together with the permanent year-end audit records.

You can restore information from this backup if you've to. For example, this backup would let you quickly recover if a power fluctuation or another problem occurred during the year-end close procedure.

1. In Microsoft Dynamics GP, point to **Maintenance** on the Microsoft Dynamics GP menu, and then select **Backup**.
