# Microsoft Entra Hybrid Sync Agent Installation Issues - Cannot start service AADConnectProvisioningAgent

This troubleshooting guide focuses on when you can't start the AADConnectProvisioningAgent service. This problem may block you from installing the Microsoft Entra Connect Provisioning Agent successfully.

## Prerequisites

To install *Cloud Provisioning Agent*, the following prerequisites are required: [Prerequisites for Microsoft Entra Connect cloud sync](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/how-to-prerequisites).

## Cannot start service AADConnectProvisioningAgent

While installing Cloud Provisioning Agent, you may get the following error:

> Service 'Microsoft Entra Connect Provisioning Agent' (AADConnectProvisioningAgent) failed to start. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system services.

Assign domain administrator credentials to the **AADConnectProvisioningAgent** service, as shown in [How to troubleshoot agent failed to start](/azure/active-directory/cloud-sync/how-to-troubleshoot#agent-failed-to-start).

After assigning credentials to the service, you may still be unable to complete the installation wizard, and receive the following error message:

> Failed changing Windows service credentials to gMSA. Please check the logs for more detailed information. If that doesn't help resolve this issue, please contact support.

If you select the **Confirm** button again in the installation wizard, following message will be displayed:

> Unable to create gMSA because KDS may not be running on domain controller. Please create/run KDS manually.

To resolve this issue, check the System event logs for **eventID 7041**. The event details describe how to assign a **Log on as a service** user right at the Local Security Policy snap-in (*secpol.msc*).
