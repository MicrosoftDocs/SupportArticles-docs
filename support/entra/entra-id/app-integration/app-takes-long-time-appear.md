# Application takes a long time to appear after clicking the "add" button

If you experience a delay in the appearance of your application after clicking the "add" button, it is possible that it may take 1-2 minutes (and sometimes longer) for the application to appear in your directory. While this is not the expected performance, you can monitor the progress of the application addition by clicking on the Notifications icon (the bell) in the upper right corner of the Azure portal and looking for an In Progress or Completed notification labeled **Adding application**.

If your application is not added or you encounter an error when clicking the Add button, you will see a Notification in an Error state. To obtain more information about the error and learn more or share with a support engineer, you can follow the steps in [How to see the details of a portal notification](./send-notification-details.md).
