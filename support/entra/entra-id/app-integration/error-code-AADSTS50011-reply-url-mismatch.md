# Error AADSTS50011 with SAML authentication - The reply URL specified in the request does not match

This article provides a resolution to the AADSTS50011 error that occurs during federated authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Symptoms

## Cause

## Resolution

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` value in the SAML request matches the Reply URL value configured in Microsoft Entra ID.
2. Verify or update the value in the Reply URL textbox to match the `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` value in the SAML request.

As an example, refer to the following article for detailed steps about how to configure the values in Microsoft Entra ID:

>[!Note]
>The reply URL is also known as Redirect URI. These values depend on what application is being used. You should get the values from the application vendor.

After you update the Reply URL value in Microsoft Entra ID and it matches the value that sent by the application in the SAML request, you should be able to sign in to the application.
