This article provides a resolution to the AADSTS50105 error that occurs during federated authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.

[!INCLUDE [Feedback](../../../includes/feedback.md)]

## Symptoms

You receive the following error message when you try to sign in to an application that has been set up to use Microsoft Entra ID for identity management using SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO):

>Error AADSTS50105 - The signed in user is not assigned to a role for the application.

## Cause

The user hasn't been granted access to the application in Microsoft Entra ID. The user must belong to a group that is assigned to the application, or be assigned directly. 

>[!Note]
>Nested groups are not supported, and the group must be directly assigned to the application.

## Resolution
