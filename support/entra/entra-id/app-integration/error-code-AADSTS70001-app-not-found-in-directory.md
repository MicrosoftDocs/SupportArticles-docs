# Error AADSTS70001 - Application with Identifier was not found in the directory

This article describes a problem in which you receive the error message "Error AADSTS70001 - Application with Identifier was not found in the directory." when trying to sign into a SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured app that has been integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Symptoms

You receive error `AADSTS70001` when trying to sign into an application that has been set up to use Microsoft Entra ID for identity management using SAML-based SSO.

## Cause

The `Issuer` attribute sent from the application to Microsoft Entra ID in the SAML request doesnâ€™t match the Identifier value that's configured for the application in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Resolution

Ensure that the `Issuer` attribute in the SAML request matches the Identifier value configured in Microsoft Entra ID.

On the SAML-based SSO configuration page, in the **Basic SAML configuration** section, verify that the value in the Identifier textbox matches the value for the identifier value displayed in the error. If there's a trailing slash at the end of the url, it should be also included.
