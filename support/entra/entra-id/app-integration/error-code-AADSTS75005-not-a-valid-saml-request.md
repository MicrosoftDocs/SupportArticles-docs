# Error AADSTS75005 - The request is not a valid Saml2 protocol message

This article describes a problem in which you receive the error message "Error AADSTS75005 - The request is not a valid Saml2 protocol message." when you try to sign into an apapplication that has been integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Symptoms

You receive error `AADSTS75005` when trying to sign into an application that has been set up to use Microsoft Entra ID for identity management using SAML-based SSO.

## Cause

Microsoft Entra ID doesn't support the SAML request sent by the application for single sign-on. Some common issues are:

- Missing required fields in the SAML request.
- SAML request encoded method.

## Resolution

1. Capture the SAML request. Follow the tutorial [How to debug SAML-based single sign-on to applications in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/debug-saml-sso-issues) to learn how to capture the SAML request.
1. Contact the application vendor and share the following info:
    - SAML request
    - [Microsoft Entra Single Sign-on SAML protocol requirements](/azure/active-directory/develop/single-sign-on-saml-protocol)

The application vendor should validate that they support the Microsoft Entra SAML implementation for single sign-on.
