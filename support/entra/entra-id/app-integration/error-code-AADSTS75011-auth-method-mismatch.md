# Error - AADSTS75011 Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef

This article describes a problem in which you receive the error message, "Error - AADSTS75011 Authentication method by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method AuthnContextClassRef," when you try to sign in to a SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) configured app that has been integrated with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Symptoms

You receive a `AADSTS75011` error message when you try to sign in to an application that has been set up to use Microsoft Entra ID for identity management by using SAML-based SSO.

## Cause

The `RequestedAuthnContext` is in the SAML request. This means the app is expecting the `AuthnContext` specified by the `AuthnContextClassRef`. However, the user has already authenticated prior to access the application and the `AuthnContext` (authentication method) used for that previous authentication is different from the one being requested. For example, a federated user access to MyApps and WIA occurred. The `AuthnContextClassRef` will be `urn:federation:authentication:windows`. Microsoft Entra ID won't perform a fresh authentication request, it will use the authentication context that was passed-through it by the IdP (ADFS or any other federation service in this case). Therefore, there will be a mismatch if the app requests other than `urn:federation:authentication:windows`. Another scenario is when MultiFactor was used: `'X509, MultiFactor`.

## Resolution

`RequestedAuthnContext` is an optional value. If possible, ask the application if the value could be removed.

Another option is to make sure that the `RequestedAuthnContext` value will be honored. This is done by requesting a fresh authentication. By doing this, when the SAML request is processed, a fresh authentication is done and `AuthnContext` is honored. In order to request a Fresh Authentication, the SAML request must contain the value, `forceAuthn="true"`.
