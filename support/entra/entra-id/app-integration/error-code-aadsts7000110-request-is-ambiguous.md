# Error AADSTS7000110: Request is ambiguous, multiple application identifiers found

This article discusses how to resolve the `AADSTS7000110` error that occurs when an application tries to obtain or refresh a token from Microsoft Entra ID.

## Symptoms

When you try to sign in to an Azure application that can be used together with Microsoft Entra ID, you receive the following `AADSTS7000110` error message:

> Request is ambiguous, multiple application identifiers found. The client ID used to obtain the grant (e.g. refresh token or authorization code) might not match the client ID passed in this request or client credential.

## Cause

The application tried to do one of the following activities:

- Redeem an OAuth2 authorization code to get an access token or a refresh token that has the wrong application ID (`client_id` parameter).

- Use a refresh token that was initially issued to the application ID of a different caller.

## Solution

Use an OAuth2 authorization code or a refresh token that's from the same application ID (`client_id` parameter).

## More information

For a full list of authentication and authorization error codes, see [Microsoft Entra authentication and authorization error codes](/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes).
