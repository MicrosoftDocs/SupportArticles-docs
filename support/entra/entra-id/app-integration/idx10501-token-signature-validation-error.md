# IDX10501 Signature Validation Errors in Microsoft Entra ID applications

If a client application obtains an access token from Microsoft Entra ID and sends it to a resource (API) application, the resource application must validate the token. It validates by using the public key from the certificate that was used to sign the token. If the application can't find the correct key identifier (kid), it might generate an error message that resembles the following message:

> IDX10501: Signature validation failed. Unable to match 'kid'

To resolve token signature validation errors such as "IDX10501," make sure that your application is configured to retrieve the correct public key from Microsoft Entra ID. Use the appropriate key discovery or metadata endpoint, based on the application type and signing configuration.

## For OAuth2 resource applications

The following steps demonstrate how an OAuth2 application validates a token that's issued from Microsoft Entra ID:

1. Use an API client to perform an [Authorization Code flow](/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) and acquire a token.
1. Decode the token by using [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms), and note the `kid`.
1. Depending on your Microsoft Entra ID application version, use the token as a bearer token to call one of the following keys discovery endpoints. The API returns three keys. The `kid` that you obtained in step 2 should match one of the keys that are returned by the keys discovery endpoint.

    For v1.0 applications, use:

    ```http
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys
    ```

    For v2.0 applications, use:

    ```http
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/v2.0/keys
    ```

## For SAML resource applications

For SAML, Microsoft Entra ID uses the app-specific certificate to sign tokens. To retrieve the correct public key, follow these steps:

1. Use the API client to acquire an access token for the SAML app.
2. Use the following keys discovery endpoint, replacing `<tenant>` and `<SAML App ID>` with your values. 

    ```http
   https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/discovery/keys?appid=<SAML App ID>
    ```
3. If your app uses custom signing keys that use a [claims-mapping policy](/entra/identity-platform/saml-claims-customization), you must append an `appid` query parameter that contains the app client ID. This step is necessary to retrieve a `jwks_uri` that points to the appâ€™s specific signing key information. For example:

    ```http
   https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
    ```
    
### Middleware configuration examples

To avoid signature validation errors, configure your middleware to use the correct metadata endpoint.

**OpenID Connect Middleware (OWIN)**

```csharp
app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
    new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
    {
        ClientId = clientId,
        Authority = authority,
        RedirectUri = redirectUri,
        MetadataAddress = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=<SAML App ID>",
        PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
    });
```

**JWT Bearer Authentication Middleware**

```csharp
app.UseJwtBearerAuthentication(new JwtBearerOptions
{
    Audience = "...",
    Authority = "...",
    MetadataAddress = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=<SAML App ID>",
    TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        // Additional validation parameters
    }
});
```

**Microsoft.Identity.Web (Web App)**

```csharp
services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(Configuration)
        .EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi()
        .AddInMemoryTokenCaches();

services.Configure<MicrosoftIdentityOptions>(options =>
{
    options.MetadataAddress = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=<SAML App ID>";
});
```

**Microsoft.Identity.Web (Web API)**

```csharp
services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(Configuration);

services.Configure<JwtBearerOptions>(JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme, options =>
{
    options.MetadataAddress = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/.well-known/openid-configuration?appid=<SAML App ID>";
});
```
