# How to send Notification Details to Microsoft support

## How to see the details of a portal notification

You can see the details of any portal notification by following the steps below:

1. Select the **Notifications** icon (the bell) in the upper right of the Azure portal.

2. Select any notification in an **Error** state (those with a red (!) icon next to them).

   > [!NOTE]  
   > You cannot click notifications in a **Successful** or **In Progress** state.

3. Use the information under **Notification Details** to understand more details about the problem.

If you still need help, you can also share this information with a support engineer or the product group to get help with your problem.

## How to get help by sending notification details to a support engineer

1. **Take a screenshot** or select the **Copy error icon**, found to the right of the **Copy error** textbox to copy all the notification details to share with a support or product group engineer.
