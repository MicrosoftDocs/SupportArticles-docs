# Authentication fails with an error stating "The requested federation realm object '< Object ID >' does not exist"

Authentication fails with the error "The requested federation realm object '< Object ID >' does not exist" for users who are part of domain that is federated with a third party identity provider in either [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) or [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365).

This failure happens when the third Party identity provider returns the wrong *IssuerURI* within the **Issuer** field in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) response.

## Resolution 1

Contact the support team for the third party identity provider and have them correct the IssuerURI, returned as *Issuer*, in the SAML the response returned to either Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365, through the client.

## Resolution 2

Use the command `Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings` to modify the IssuerURI of the federated domain to match the realm object listed in the error.

[!INCLUDE [Azure AD PowerShell deprecation note](~/../support/reusable-content/msgraph-powershell/includes/aad-powershell-deprecation-note.md)]

1. Connect to Microsoft Entra ID using the *MSONLINE* module. To check that the module is installed, open PowerShell and execute the `get-module MSONLINE -ListAvailable` command.

2. Follow the steps outlined in [Install the Azure AD module](/powershell/azure/active-directory/install-msonlinev1#install-the-azure-ad-module) to install the module.

3. Run the following commands to verify the preferred authentication protocol of the federated domain.

   ```powershell
   $federationSettings=Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName domain.com

   $federationSettings.PreferredAuthenticationProtocol
   ```

4. If the `PreferredAuthenticationProtocol` value listed in step 3 is shown as **WSFED**, run the following command to update the **IssuerURI**.

   ```powershell
   Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName domain.com -IssuerUri "value of federated realm object listed in the authentication failure message"
   ```

   The necessary IssuerURI value is listed by Microsoft Entra ID in the authentication failure message.

5. If the `PreferredAuthenticationProtocol` value listed in step 3 is SAMLP (SAML Protocol), run the following command to update the IssuerURI.

   ```powershell
   Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName domain.com -IssuerUri "value of federated realm object listed in the authentication failure message" -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol samlp
   ```

   The necessary IssuerURI value is listed by Microsoft Entra ID in the authentication failure message.
