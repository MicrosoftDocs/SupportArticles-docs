# Microsoft Entra Connect excludes a user's primary group from its group membership

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4014115

## Summary

Microsoft Entra Connect doesn't support primary group functionality. Therefore, it does not query the **PrimaryGroupID** attribute to build the group membership of a user. This may cause problems for users who are still using the primary group feature.

When you set the primary group for a user, that user is excluded from the corresponding group membership in Active Directory. Instead, the **PrimaryGroupID** attribute is set with that group.

For example:

1. User1 belongs to Group1, which means that Group1 has User1 as a member.
2. The primary group is changed on User1 from Domain Users to Group1:
    1. User1 is excluded from Group1 Members.
    2. User1 is added as a member of Domain Admins (because it's no longer the primary group).
    3. The User1 **PrimaryGroupID** attribute is set with the Group1 reference.

Programs that need to query groups to give users access that is based on group membership should also query for the **PrimaryGroupID** attribute. However, Microsoft Entra Connect does not support **PrimaryGroupID** because of the complexity of group membership synchronization.
