## Cause

This issue occurs if one or more of the following conditions are true:

- You entered the wrong user name or password.
- You aren't a company administrator.
- You don't have a subscription that includes Azure Information Protection.
- The network is preventing you from connecting to Azure Information Protection.
- You're using Windows PowerShell 7. Using PowerShell 7 will result in the "Object reference not set to an instance of an object" error. For more information, see [Known issues - Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/known-issues#powershell-support-for-the-azure-information-protection-client).

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> If Azure Information Protection isn't enabled for your company, you use the Microsoft 365 admin center to enable it. For more info about how to do this, read [Azure Information Protection deployment road map](/azure/information-protection/deployment-roadmap).

To resolve this issue, make sure that the following are true:

- Make sure that you enter the correct user name and password. To check that you entered them correctly, sign in to the [Office 365 portal](https://portal.office.com).
- You must be a global administrator to connect to Azure Information Protection.
- To use Azure Information Protection, you must have a subscription that includes Azure Information Protection.
- Work with the network administrator to make sure that the network meets [the requirements for connecting to Azure Information Protection](/azure/information-protection/requirements#firewalls-and-network-infrastructure). The requirements are as follows:
  - Incoming and outgoing connections to `*.aadrm.com` are enabled.
  - Incoming and outgoing connections to `*.cloudapp.net` (`rmsoprod*-b-rms*.cloudapp.net`) are enabled.
  - Port 443 is open.
- Use Windows PowerShell 5. You can check the PowerShell version by using the `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion` command.
