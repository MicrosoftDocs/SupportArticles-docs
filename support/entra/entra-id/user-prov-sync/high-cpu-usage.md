# High CPU usage in Microsoft Entra Connect Health for Sync

This article provides information about resolving an issue in which high CPU usage occurs in Microsoft Entra Connect Health for Sync.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Entra ID  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4346822

## Symptoms

You experience slow performance and high CPU usage (up to 100 percent) on a computer that runs the Microsoft Entra Connect Health for Sync monitoring agent. In Task Manager, you notice that the **Microsoft.Online.Reporting.MonitoringAgent.Startup**  process is causing the high CPU usage.

> [!NOTE]
> This issue is not limited to any specific Microsoft Entra Connect Health versions or operating system versions.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the June 2018 update for .NET Framework 4.7.2 is installed on the computer, and the Microsoft Entra Connect Health for Sync monitoring agent does not fully support this update.

The following .NET Framework update would cause the high CPU issue by the monitoring agent.

| .NET Framework update| System version|

| KB4338606| Windows Server 2008 R2 |
