## Cause

This issue occurs if one of the following conditions is true:

- You used an incorrect format when you entered your user name.
- Your user account is enabled for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.

## Resolution

Do one of the following, as appropriate for your situation.

### Scenario 1: You used an incorrect format when you entered your user name

Use the following format when you enter your user name:

`<user_name >@<domain>`

For example, `john@contoso.com` is in the correct format. Entering `john` or `contoso\john` doesn't work.

<a name='scenario-2-your-user-account-is-enabled-for-azure-ad-multi-factor-authentication'></a>

### Scenario 2: Your user account is enabled for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication

If your user account is enabled for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication, Microsoft doesn't currently support using the Azure Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell to connect to Microsoft Entra ID.

To perform administrative tasks by using the Azure Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell, use either of the following methods:

- Disable Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication for the user account.
- Use a different admin account that isn't enabled for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication.
