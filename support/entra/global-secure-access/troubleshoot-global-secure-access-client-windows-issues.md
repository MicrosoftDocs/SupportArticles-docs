# Troubleshoot issues in the Global Secure Access client for Windows

The [Global Secure Access client](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client) is deployed on a managed Microsoft Windows device (that is, a Microsoft Entra hybrid join device or a Microsoft Entra joined device). It enables an organization to control network traffic between these devices and various websites, applications, and resources that are available on the internet or an intranet (on-premises corporate network). If you use this method to route traffic, you can enforce and apply more checks and controls, such as continuous access evaluation (CAE), device compliance, and multi-factor authentication, for resource access.

## Installation

Use the following methods to install the Global Secure Access client on a managed Windows device:

- Download and install on a Windows device as a local administrator.

- Deploy through Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Group Policy for a Microsoft Entra hybrid join device.

- Deploy through Intune or other MDM service for a Microsoft Entra hybrid join or Microsoft Entra joined device.

If you experience a failure when you try to install the Global Secure Access client, check the following items:

- [Prerequisites for the Global Secure Access client for Windows](/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-install-windows-client#prerequisites)

- Errors in the Global Secure Access client logs (*C:\\Users\\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Global_Secure_Access_Client_\<number>.log*)

- Application and system event logs for any other errors, such as a process failure

If you experience issues when you try to upgrade a client, first try to uninstall the earlier client version and restart the device, and then try again to install the upgrade.

## Self-Service diagnostic tools for post-installation issues

Use the following self-service diagnostic tools to troubleshoot issues in the Global Secure Access client after a successful installation:

- [**Troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client: advanced diagnostics**](/entra/global-secure-access/troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-advanced-diagnostics)
- [**Troubleshoot the Global Secure Access client: Health check tab**](/entra/global-secure-access/troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-diagnostics-health-check)

If the diagnostic tools can't fix the issues, [collect troubleshooting logs](/entra/global-secure-access/troubleshoot-global-secure-access-client-advanced-diagnostics?branch=main#advanced-log-collection-tab), and then submit a support ticket by including the logs.
