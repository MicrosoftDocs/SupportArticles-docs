> [!NOTE]
> The Log Analytics agent, also known as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA), [will be retired in August 2024](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-cloud/microsoft-defender-for-cloud-strategy-and-plan-towards-log/ba-p/3883341). As a result, the Defender for Servers and Defender for SQL servers on machines plans in Microsoft Defender for Cloud will be updated, and features that rely on the Log Analytics agent will be redesigned. For more information, see [Prepare for retirement of the Log Analytics agent](/azure/defender-for-cloud/prepare-deprecation-log-analytics-mma-agent).
