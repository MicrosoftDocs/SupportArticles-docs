After the first memory dump is created, you see a confirmation in **Command Prompt**. By default, the memory dump is saved in the same location as **procdump.exe**.

If you're using other Procdump options that rely on specific conditions to trigger a dump, keep an eye on the PID. If it changes, you need to stop the command and run it again with the new PID. Otherwise, no memory dumps will be generated.
