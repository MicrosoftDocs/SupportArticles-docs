When you try to create a new Azure Virtual Machine (VM), the common errors you encounter are provisioning failures or allocation failures.

* A provisioning failure happens when the OS image fails to load either due to incorrect preparatory steps or because of selecting the wrong settings during the image capture from the portal.
* An allocation failure results when the cluster or region either does not have resources available or cannot support the requested VM size.
