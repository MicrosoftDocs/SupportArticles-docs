> ### New! Try VM assist for Faster Diagnostics
> We recommend that you run [VM assist for Windows](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/blob/master/vmassist/windows) or [VM assist for Linux](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/blob/master/vmassist/linux). These script-based diagnostic tools help you to identify common issues that affect the Azure VM Guest Agent and overall VM health.
