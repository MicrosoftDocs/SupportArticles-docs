> We recommend running [VM assist for Windows](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/blob/master/vmassist/windows) or [VM assist for Linux](https://github.com/Azure/azure-support-scripts/blob/master/vmassist/linux), script-based diagnostic tools designed to identify common issues with the Azure VM Guest Agent and overall VM health.
