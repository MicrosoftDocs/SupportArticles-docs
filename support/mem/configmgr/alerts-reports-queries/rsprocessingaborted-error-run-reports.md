_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager, SQL Server 2019

## Symptoms

- > An error has occurred during report processing. (rsProcessingAborted)
- > The EXECUTE permission was denied on the object 'fnIsCas', database 'CM_LKD', schema 'dbo'

```output

```

## Cause

This issue occurs because of the [Scalar UDF Inlining](/sql/relational-databases/user-defined-functions/scalar-udf-inlining) feature in SQL Server 2019. A query that uses Scalar UDF Inlining might return an error or unexpected results. For more information, see [Scalar UDF Inlining issues in SQL Server 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4538581).

## Resolution

To fix this issue, install [KB5000642 - cumulative update 9](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5000642) or a later cumulative update for SQL Server 2019.
