    1. On the site server, open an elevated command prompt.
    2. Change the directory to the \<Configuration Manager 2012 install location>\client directory. For example, change the directory to D:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Client.

    3. Run the `Ccmsetup.exe /source: "D:\Program Files\Microsoft Configuration Manager\Client"` command (based on the example in the previous step).

3. Reinstall the management point role.
