# Mac client enrollment fails if passwords contain special characters

This article provides a workaround to solve the issue that Mac client enrollment fails in Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager if the password has special characters.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2839072

## Symptoms

The Configuration Manager CMEnroll tool fails on a Mac client computer with the following error:

> Error received:Server Connection failed. HTTP Response code is 400 and reason is Bad request.

## Cause

This issue can occur if the user has the special characters **&** and **<** in their domain password. CMEnroll.exe doesn't encode the **&** and **<** special characters correctly for Mac-based clients.

## Resolution

To work around this issue, have the user change the password so that it doesn't contain these special characters.

## More information
