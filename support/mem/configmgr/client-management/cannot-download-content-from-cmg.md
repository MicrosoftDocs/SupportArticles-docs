# WINHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_FLAG_CERT_CN_INVALID using a CMG as a cloud DP with a third-party certificate

This article describes an issue in which content can't be downloaded from a cloud management gateway (CMG) that functions as a cloud distribution point (DP), and you receive an **WINHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_FLAG_CERT_CN_INVALID** error message.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch)  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4495265

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You create a CMG, and you enable the **Allow CMG to function as a cloud distribution point and serve content from Azure storage** setting.
- You use a CMG server authentication certificate from a third-party provider. The CMG service FQDN is configured as \<*CMGname*>.\<*your domain*>.

In this scenario, you experience the following issues:

- Existing clients can't download content from the CMG. Errors entries that resemble the following are logged in DataTransferservice.log:

- Client files can't be downloaded from CMG to set up new clients. Errors entries that resemble the following are logged in Ccmsetup.log:

## Cause

This issue occurs because the clients try to access the CMG cloud service by looking for the default FQDN of \<*CMGname*>.CloudApp.net, and this name doesn't match the actual FQDN of \<*CMGname*>.\<*your domain*>. Therefore, the **WINHTTP_CALLBACK_STATUS_FLAG_CERT_CN_INVALID** error is reported.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable CMG as a cloud distribution point, the globally unique CMG service name that you choose must also be a globally unique Azure storage account name. An Azure storage account name is always created under the CloudApp.net subdomain. Because the CloudApp.net domain is owned by Microsoft, a third-party certificate provider can't create a certificate for CloudApp.net.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, update to Configuration Manager current branch version 1902.
