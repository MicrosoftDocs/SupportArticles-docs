# New CMG creation fails after entering sign-in credentials in Configuration Manager

This article helps to resolve the issue in which a new Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) creation fails after entering sign-in credentials in Configuration Manager version 2207 or earlier versions.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager current branch, versions 2207, 2203, and 2111

## Cause

The new CMG creation fails because the Configuration Manager console terminates unexpectedly after entering sign-in credentials in Configuration Manager.

When you try to create a CMG, there's a failure to obtain the Microsoft Graph token, and the `Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalUiRequiredException` exception is referenced in the *SMSAdminUI.log* file.

This issue occurs in one of the following conditions:

- The `Prompt.Never` flag is passed, but the constraint can't be honored because user interaction is required.
- An error occurs during a silent web authentication that prevents the HTTP authentication flow from completing in a short enough time frame.

## Resolution
