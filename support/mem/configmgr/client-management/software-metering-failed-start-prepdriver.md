## Cause

This error can occur if you install rollup 3125574 before you install the Configuration Manager client software. In that scenario, PrepDrv is not installed during the Configuration Manager client setup process.

## Resolution 1

1. Uninstall rollup 3125574 and the Configuration Manager client. You can uninstall the Configuration Manager client software from a computer by using `CCMSetup.exe` with the `/Uninstall` property. For more information, see [Uninstall the client](/mem/configmgr/core/clients/manage/manage-clients#BKMK_UninstalClient).
2. Reinstall the Configuration Manager client software.
3. Reinstall rollup [3125574](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3125574).

   To verify that the installation completed successfully, check mtrmgr.log and make sure no errors are found.

## Resolution 2

Manually install PrepDrv by running the following command from a command prompt:

```console
RUNDLL32.EXE SETUPAPI.DLL,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 C:\WINDOWS\CCM\prepdrv.inf
```
