## Cause

This issue is caused by the System Center 2012 Orchestrator Integration Pack for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager (7.0) registering two assemblies in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).

- AdminUI.WqlQueryEngine.dll (5.0.0.0)
- Microsoft.ConfigurationManagement.ManagementProvider.dll (5.0.0.0)

## Resolution

To solve this issue, follow the steps below:

 1. Uninstall the System Center 2012 Integration Pack for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager from **Add/Remove Programs**.
 2. From **Add/Remove Programs**, right-click the System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Console and select **Repair**.
 3. You should now be able to successfully launch the Configuration Manager console.
 4. If desired, install the System Center 2012 SP1 Integration Pack for System Center 2012 Configuration Manager (7.1). This integration pack will not register any assemblies in the GAC.
