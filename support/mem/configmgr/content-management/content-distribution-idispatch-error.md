# IDispatch error #3603 when you distribute content to DPs in Configuration Manager

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4509132

## Symptoms

Content distribution to distribution points in Configuration Manager fails, and the following error messages are logged in DistMgr.log on the parent site server:

## Cause

This issue occurs if IIS configuration on the distribution point server is changed incorrectly, so that some required IIS components are missing, such as the **IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility** and **IIS 6 WMI Compatibility** components.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, verify IIS configuration within **Server Manager**, on the server that hosts the distribution point, and make sure that all required IIS components are installed.

For more information about the prerequisites for distribution point, see [Distribution point](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/configs/site-and-site-system-prerequisites#bkmk_2012dppreq).
