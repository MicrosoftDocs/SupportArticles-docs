# Clients don't update with the latest antimalware definition files after the Endpoint Protection point role is installed

This article introduces a workaround for the issue that clients are not updated with the latest antimalware definition files after you install the Endpoint Protection point site system role in Configuration Manager.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2688242

## Symptoms

You install the Endpoint Protection point site system role in Configuration Manager and set the **Manage Endpoint Protection client on client computers** setting to **True** on the Endpoint Protection page. In this scenario, client computers are not updated with the latest antimalware definition files.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the **Disable alternate sources (such as Microsoft Windows Update, Microsoft Windows Server Update Services, or UNC shares) for the initial definition update on client computers** option is set to **True** which is the default setting.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, set the **Disable alternate sources (such as Microsoft Windows Update, Microsoft Windows Server Update Services, or UNC shares) for the initial definition update on client computers** option to **False**. After you change this setting, the clients can download and install antimalware definition file updates immediately after installation as long as the client has access to one of the sources that hosts the files.
