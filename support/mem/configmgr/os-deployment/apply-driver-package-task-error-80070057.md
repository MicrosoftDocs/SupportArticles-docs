## Cause

The new **Install driver package via running DISM with recurse option** feature in the **Apply Driver Package** task is introduced in Configuration Manager current branch version 1706. If the existing boot images aren't updated to the new Configuration Manager binaries, this option isn't recognized. Therefore, error 80070057 is returned.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, follow these steps to update the boot images:

1. In the Configuration Manager console, select **Software Library**.
2. In the Software Library workspace, expand **Operating Systems**, and then select **Boot Images**.
3. Right-click the boot image that you want to update, and then select **Update Distribution Points**.
4. Repeat step 3 for all boot images that were previously distributed.
