# Configure operating system deployment in System Center 2012 Configuration Manager

Most support issues that affect operating system deployment (OSD) in System Center 2012 Configuration Manager stem from product misconfigurations. Although there are no simple guidelines to implement something as powerful and complex as OSD, this article describes the step-by-step process for configuring System Center 2012 Configuration Manager (ConfigMgr 2012) to capture an existing Windows image. This article also guides you through creating a client package and task sequence to deploy and install that image.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Microsoft System Center 2012 Configuration Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2969096

## Introduction

This article assumes that you have an existing environment that has a Configuration Manager 2012 site installed and also a primary site that's running Configuration Manager 2012. These steps can also be used together with a stand-alone primary site that is running Configuration Manager 2012. Additionally, this article requires that the Network Access Account and Boundaries are configured correctly, and that ConfigMgr client agents are installed on the clients.

### Overview of the technology

OSD provides System Center 2012 Configuration Manager administrative users a tool to create operating system images that can be deployed both to computers that are managed by Configuration Manager and to unmanaged computers. You can do this by using bootable media, such as a CD set, DVD, or USB flash drives. A description of each component of the OSD process can be found in [Introduction to Operating System Deployment in Configuration Manager](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/gg682108(v=technet.10)).

## Prerequisites

|Task|Detailed steps|
|---|---|
|Prerequisites|This article assumes you have an existing environment with a Configuration Manager 2012 site installed as well as a primary site running Configuration Manager 2012. These steps can also be used with a standalone primary site running Configuration Manager 2012. Further, this article requires that the Network Access Account and Boundaries are properly configured and that ConfigMgr client agents are installed on the clients.|
|Computers used in this exercise|GTRCM12CAS (ConfigMgr 2012 central administration site (CAS) server)<br/>GTRCM12PRI1 (ConfigMgr 2012 primary site server)<br/>GTRCM12WIN7B (ConfigMgr 2012 client)<br/>GTRCMXP01 (ConfigMgr 2012 client)<br/>|

## Configure the components

In this section, we will install the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) role on GTRCM12PRI1 and then share a folder. We will configure a distribution point (DP) to respond to incoming PXE requests, and then we will copy x86 and x64 boot images to it.

|Task|Detailed steps|
|---|---|
|| Complete the following steps on the primary site server (GTRCM12PRI1) |
|Open an elevated command prompt|1. On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Accessories**, and then point to **Command Prompt**. Right-click it and select **Run as administrator** from the shortcut menu.|
|Share folder Flats as Sources|2. Run the `net share Sources=C:\Flats /Grant:System,Full /Grant:Administrators,Full` command to grant System and local admin permission to the Sources share.<br/><br/>:::image type="content" source="media/configure-operating-system-deployment/admin-command-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command in administrator command prompt." border="false":::<br/>|
|Log off GTRCM12PRI1||
|| Complete the following tasks on the CAS (GTRCM12CAS) |
|Start the Configuration Manager Console|1. On the **Start** menu, point to **All Programs**, point to **Microsoft System Center**, point to **Configuration Manager 2012**, and then select **ConfigMgr Console**.|
||2. Switch to the Administration Overview page. Expand **Site Configuration** > **Servers and Site System Roles**. Select the primary site server (GTRCM12PRI1). Look for **Distribution point** located in the **Site System Roles** area, then right-click it and select **Properties** from the menu.<br/><br/>:::image type="content" source="media/configure-operating-system-deployment/servers-and-site-system-roles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Servers and Site System Roles.":::|

## Create a custom task sequence to capture an image

Here we will create a custom task sequence to capture an image from a client named GTRCM12WIN7B. After a successful capture, we will then use this image to reinstall a second client (GTRCM12XP1) with Windows 7.
