# Enable BitLocker task fails with error 80070057 in Configuration Manager

This article fixes an issue in which the **Enable BitLocker** task fails with error 80070057 in Configuration Manager.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch - version 1806)  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4474026

## Symptoms

After you upgrade to Configuration Manager current branch version 1806, the **Enable BitLocker** task fails, and you receive the following error message in the Smsts.log file:

## Cause

This issue is caused by an update in Configuration Manager current branch version 1806. The **Enable BitLocker** and **Pre-Provision BitLocker** actions require newer versions of OSDBitLocker.exe and OSDOfflineBitlocker.exe that are included in boot image version 5.00.8592.1008 and the Configuration Manager current branch version 1806 client package.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, update the boot image to version 5.00.8592.1008, and use the Configuration Manager current branch version 1806 client package in the task sequence.
