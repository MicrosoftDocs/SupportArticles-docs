## Cause

This issue occurs if a custom SetupComplete.cmd file is specified. OSD task sequences use the SetupComplete.cmd file to continue the task sequence after Windows Setup finishes. If a custom SetupComplete.cmd file is specified, the task sequence can't install its own SetupComplete.cmd file. And it returns the **Access is denied** error. So custom SetupComplete.cmd files aren't allowed with Configuration Manager OSD task sequences.

A custom SetupComplete.cmd file may be specified in one of the following ways:

- It's copied to the appropriate location in a task (usually a **Run Command Line** task) between the **Apply Operating System** and **Setup Windows and ConfigMgr** tasks. Below is an example of the command line in a **Run Command Line** task:

  `cmd.exe /c copy SetupComplete.cmd %OSDTargetSystemDrive%\Windows\Setup\Scripts`

- It's included as part of a custom OS WIM file.

The SetupComplete.cmd file is located in the `%WINDIR%\Setup\Scripts` folder, in either the offline OS or the OS WIM image.

For more information about the SetupComplete.cmd file, see [Add a Custom Script to Windows Setup](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-a-custom-script-to-windows-setup).

## Resolution

To fix this issue, remove the custom SetupComplete.cmd file. In most cases, any actions being taken in the custom SetupComplete.cmd file can instead be moved as tasks in the task sequence.

Depending on how the custom SetupComplete.cmd file is specified, use one of the following methods to remove the file:

- If it's specified in a **Run Command Line** task between the **Apply Operating System** and **Setup Windows and ConfigMgr** tasks, remove the **Run Command Line** task from the task sequence.
- If it's part of a custom OS image, add a **Run Command Line** task between the **Apply Operating System** and **Setup Windows and ConfigMgr** tasks. In the command line of the **Run Command Line** task, enter the following command to delete the custom SetupComplete.cmd file:

  `cmd.exe /c del SetupComplete.cmd %OSDTargetSystemDrive%\Windows\Setup\Scripts /F /Q`
