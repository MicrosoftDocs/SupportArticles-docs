You can use Operating System Deployment (OSD) to deploy the Windows operating system and to upgrade to a newer version. However, depending on the version of Windows that you want to deploy, you may have to first upgrade the Configuration Manager version that you're using.

The following table provides details about which version of Configuration Manager you need in order to deploy a particular version of Windows.

|Version of Windows being deployed| Version of Configuration Manager required |
