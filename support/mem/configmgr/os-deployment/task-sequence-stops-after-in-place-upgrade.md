# Configuration Manager task sequence doesn't continue after an in-place upgrade to Windows 10

This article fixes an issue in which the task sequence in Configuration Manager doesn't continue after an in-place upgrade from Window 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch)  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4470553

## Symptoms

You run the Windows 10 in-place upgrade task sequence in Configuration Manager to upgrade the operating system on the computer. If you upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, the task sequence doesn't continue after the in-place upgrade completes. Additionally, when you examine the smsts.log file, you find the following entries logged:

> TSManager Start to compile TS policy  
> TSManager spPolicyNamespace.Open(pszNamespace, true), HRESULT=8004100e (..\utils.cpp,3450)  
> TSManager Failed to open WMI Namespace 'root\ccm\policy\defaultmachine\requestedconfig'. WMI Repository may be corrupted  
> Invalid namespace (Error: 8004100E; Source: WMI)  
> TSManager End TS policy compilation  
> TSManager CompileXMLPolicy(c_szRequestedConfigNS, sPolicyID, sPolicyVersion, c_szTSPolicySource, sPolicyRuleID, sPolicyData), HRESULT=8004100e (..\utils.cpp,3680)  
> TSManager CompilePolicy(sPolicyXml, sInstanceList), HRESULT=8004100e (..\utils.cpp,3710)  
> TSManager TS::Utility::CompileConfigPolicyEx(m_bNoSMSClient || m_bInWinPE || STADALONE_MODE == m_StartupMode || bProvMode), HRESULT=8004100e (tsmanager.cpp,1568)  
> TSManager Error compiling client config policies. code 8004100E  
> TSManager Task Sequence Manager could not initialize Task Sequence Environment. code 8004100E  
> TSManager hr = InitializeEnvironment(), HRESULT=8004100e (tsmanager.cpp,1244)  
> TSManager Task sequence execution failed with error code 8004100E

## Cause

This issue can occur if Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.1 was already installed on the OS (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) when the in-place upgrade task sequence started.

WMF 5.1 installs a Windows 10 version of the **WMIMigrationPlugin.dll** file in the `C:\Windows\System32\migration` directory. This DLL is responsible for migrating the WMI repository during the in-place upgrade. However, the Windows 10 version of the **WMIMigrationPlugin.dll** file is incompatible with Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Therefore, the migration of the WMI repository fails during the in-place upgrade. This results in the WMI repository becoming corrupted, and the task sequence can't continue in the new (Windows 10) OS.

## Resolution

This issue is fixed by the latest Windows 7 cumulative update. If the latest Windows 7 cumulative update is installed after WMF 5.1 is installed, the cumulative update correctly replaces **WMIMigrationPlugin.dll** with a Windows 7-compatible version. However, if WMF 5.1 is installed after the last Windows 7 cumulative update is installed, the issue will still occur. The issue will then get corrected when the next Windows 7 cumulative update is installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is currently no fix for this issue in the Windows 8.1 cumulative updates.

For Windows 7 scenarios where WMF 5.1 was installed after the last cumulative update and for all Windows 8.1 scenarios, or just to make sure that a correct version of **WMIMigrationPlugin.dll** is installed before you run an in-place upgrade in Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, tasks can be added to the task sequence to remediate the issue.

A download of the exported task sequence that contains the steps that should be added to the in-place upgrade task sequence in Configuration Manager is available.
