# Errors when capturing Windows 11 image by using capture media in Configuration Manager

This article provides solutions for some errors that occur when you capture a Windows 11 image by using capture media in Configuration Manager.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch)

## Symptoms

When you try to capture a Windows 11 image by using capture media in Configuration Manager, you may experience one or more of the following errors:

- [VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found](#vcruntime140dllwasnotfound)
- [Package \<package name> was installed for a user, but not provisioned for all users](#packagenotprovisionedforallusers)
- [An update or servicing operation may be using reserved storage](#updateisinprocess)
- [Volume '\\\\?\Volume{GUID}\' not found](#volumenotfound)

See the following sections for error details, causes and solutions.

## <a id="vcruntime140dllwasnotfound"></a>VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found

When you start the capture process by using *TSMBAutoRun.exe*, you receive the following error message:

> OsdCaptureCD.exe â€“ System Error  
> The code execution cannot proceed because VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found. Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.

Default Visual C++ Runtime components are installed as a prerequisite during the Configuration Manager Client Agent installation. If your reference installation is disconnected from your Configuration Manager environment, these Visual C++ Runtime components will be missing.

### Solution: Install vcredist_x64.exe

To resolve this issue, install *vcredist_x64.exe*, and make sure that the installed version matches the version that's available in the *\\\\\<SCCM-Server>\\<SMS_SiteCode>\Client\x64* share folder.

After *vcredist_x64.exe* is installed, restart the capture process.

## <a id="packagenotprovisionedforallusers"></a>Package \<package name> was installed for a user, but not provisioned for all users

Check the *setupact.log* file in the *C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\Panther* folder. If some applications are blocking the capture process, the "Package \<Package name> was installed for a user, but not provisioned for all users" error will be displayed in the *setupact.log* file like the following output:

```output

```

### Solution: Remove package for current user

To resolve this issue, remove the package by running the `Remove-AppxPackage -Package <package name>` cmdlet as follows:

```powershell
Remove-AppxPackage -Package Microsoft.OneDriveSync_21220.1024.5.0_neutral__8wekyb3d8bbwe
```

After the package is removed, restart the capture process and monitor other packages in the same situation.

## <a id="updateisinprocess"></a>An update or servicing operation may be using reserved storage

Check the *setupact.log* file in the *C:\Windows\System32\Sysprep\Panther* folder. If some updates are being installed on the computer, the "An update or servicing operation may be using reserved storage" error is displayed in the *setupact.log* file like the following output:

```output
02-07-2022 14:24:15.000 SYSPRP Sysprep_Clean_Validate_Opk: Audit mode cannot be turned on if reserved storage is in use. An update or servicing operation may be using reserved storage.; hr = 0x800F0975

```

### Solution: Ensure computer is up to date

To resolve this issue, install updates on the computer until no updates are available.

After the computer is up to date and restarted, restart the capture process.

## <a id="volumenotfound"></a>Volume '\\\\?\Volume{GUID}\' not found

When you boot the computer into Windows PE (WinPE) and capture the Windows image (.WIM) file, the "Volume '\\\\?\Volume{GUID}\' not found" error is displayed in the *SMSTS.log* file like the following output:

```output
02-07-2022 09:41:51.246 TSBootShell 1136 (0x470) RAM Disk Boot Path: MULTI(0)DISK(0)RDISK(0)PARTITION(3)\_SMSTASKSEQUENCE\WINPE\SOURCES\BOOT.WIM

```

This issue occurs because no drive letter is assigned to the operating system (OS) partition that needs to be captured. This is because the **No Default Drive Letter** attribute is set to **Yes** for the Windows 11 C drive. See the following screenshot for an example:

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-11-image-capture-fail/no-default-drive-letter-attribute.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the No Default Drive Letter attribute is set to Yes.":::

### Solution: Allow automatic assignment of drive letters

To resolve this issue, restart the computer into Windows 11 original OS, and change the partition attributes to reenable the automatic assignment by running the following commands:

```cmd
diskpart
Select Disk 0
Select Partition 3
GPT attributes=0x0000000000000000
Exit
```

To confirm that the automatic assignment is enabled and the drive letter is assigned to the partition, use the `detail partition` command as follows:

```cmd
diskpart
Select Disk 0
Select Partition 3
detail partition
```

See the following screenshot for the correct partition attributes:

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-11-image-capture-fail/detail-partition-command-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the detail partition command output.":::

`Partition 3` that's used in the command lines above is just an example. The selected partition should match the partition index of your current installed OS. To determine the partition, run the following commands:

```cmd
diskpart
Select Disk 0
list partition
```

See the following screenshot for the command output. Use the partition that's marked as Primary.

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-11-image-capture-fail/list-partition-command-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list partition command output.":::

After the assignment is completed, restart the capture process.
