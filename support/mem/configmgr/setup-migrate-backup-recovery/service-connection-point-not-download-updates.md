# Configuration Manager service connection point doesn't download updates

This article helps you fix an issue where a service connection point doesn't download updates. This issue occurs when the Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificate is missing, expired, or corrupted.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch), Microsoft Intune  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3187516

## Symptoms

A service connection point that's running in a Configuration Manager current branch environment doesn't download updates, and entries that resemble the following are logged in DMPDownloader.log:

> Download manifest.cab SMS_DMP_DOWNLOADER 8/2/2016 2:20:24 PM 7568 (0x1D90)  
> WARNING: Failed to download easy setup payload with exception: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. SMS_DMP_DOWNLOADER 8/2/2016 2:20:25 PM 10760 (0x2A08)  
> WARNING: Retry in the next polling cycle SMS_DMP_DOWNLOADER 8/2/2016 2:20:25 PM 10760 (0x2A08)

You may also notice client connectivity issues when you use Microsoft Intune.

## Cause

The service connection point uses the Intune service when it connects to [http://go.Microsoft.com](https://go.Microsoft.com) or [https://manage.Microsoft.com](https://manage.microsoft.com). If the Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificate is missing, expired, or corrupted, the Intune connection attempt is rejected.

## Resolution

This is a known issue for Intune, as documented in [Connectivity issues may occur when the Baltimore CyberTrust root certificate is not installed](../../intune/certificates/fix-connectivity-issues.md). However, this update is no longer displayed on the Microsoft Update Catalog.

As a workaround, you can export the certificate from the certificate authority in your environment.

After you've obtained the certificate, you must import it. To import the certificate, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt with administrative rights (run as Administrator).
2. Run the `mmc` command.
3. On the **File** menu, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.
4. Select **Certificates**, and then select **Add**.
5. Select **Computer Account**, and then select **Next**.
6. Select **Local Computer**, select **Finish**, and then select **OK**.
7. In the console tree, expand **Certificates** > **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** > **Certificates**.
8. Right-click **Certificates**, and then select **Import**.
9. Import the Baltimore CyberTrust Root certificate.
10. Restart the computer.

You should now see an entry for Baltimore CyberTrust Root under **Trusted Root Certificate Authority**:
