# Error 0x800f0831 when you install an update

This article fixes an issue in which you receive error 0x800f0831 when you install a cumulative update.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Configuration Manager (current branch), Windows Server Update Services  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4477073

## Symptom

When you try to install a Windows update, especially a cumulative update, you receive the following error message in _WindowsUpdate.log_:

> FATAL: CBS called Error with 0x800f0831

This issue is more likely to occur when there's no access to Microsoft Update.

Additionally, you receive error messages that resemble the following in _CBS.log_:

> Store corruption, manifest missing for package: \<Missing_Package>  
> Failed to resolve package \<Missing_Package> [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Mark store corruption flag because of package: \<Missing_Package> [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to resolve package [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to get next package to re-evaluate [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to execute execution chain. [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> Failed to process single phase execution. [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]  
> WER: Generating failure report for package:\<Failed_Package> status: 0x800f0831, failure source: Execute, start state: Staged, target state: Installed, client id: DISM Package Manager Provider  

> [!NOTE]
> \<Failed_Package> represents the package that can't be installed. \<Missing_Package> represents the package for which the manifest is missing.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the update that can't be installed requires the manifest of a previous update package.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1: Repair the component store with DISM commands

To repair the component store using the `DISM RestoreHealth` command, follow these steps:

1. Open an elevated command prompt and run these commands:

    ```console
    DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /SCANHEALTH
    ```

    ```console
    DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /CHECKHEALTH
    ```

    ```console
    DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /RESTOREHEALTH
    ```

    ```console
    Sfc /Scannow
    ```

2. Restart the device.

### Method 2: Manually repair with the payload of the partially installed component

1. Go to [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/).
2. In the **Search** box, enter the package ID of the \<Missing_Package>.
3. Find the update that applies to your operating system appropriately in the search results, and then select the **Download** button.
4. In the Microsoft Update Catalog window, select the link of the file to download the update.
5. Select **Close** after the download process is done. Then, you can find a folder that contains the update package in the location that you specified.
6. Open the folder, and then double-click the update package to install the update.
