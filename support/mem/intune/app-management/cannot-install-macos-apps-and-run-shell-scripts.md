# Apps don't install and shell scripts don't run in macOS 11.2

## Symptoms

You experience the following issues on a macOS Big Sur 11.2._x_-based device:

- Apps can't be downloaded and installed.
- The app installation status shows **Install Pending** in the Microsoft Intune admin center indefinitely.
- Shell scripts don't run because the Microsoft Intune management agent can't be installed successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> These issues might occur sporadically. Not all macOS 11.2._x_ clients in a tenant experience the issues.

When these issues occur, entries that resemble the following example are logged on the device console:

```output

            NSLocalizedDescription = "Install request is a duplicate";
        };
    };
    "__Success__" = 0;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The presence of error code **506** and an **Install request is a duplicate** entry in the log are evidence of this issue.
