# Your organization has removed its data associated with this app

This article helps you fix an issue where you receive the **Your organization has removed its data associated with this app** error message when you open the Outlook for Android app that's managed by a Microsoft Intune app protection policy (APP).

## Symptoms

When you open the Outlook for Android app that's managed by an Intune APP, you receive the following message:

> Your organization has removed its data associated with this app because the Microsoft Intune Company Portal data or application was removed. To reconnect, you must sign-in with your work or school account.

## Cause

This issue occurs for one of the following reasons:

- Outlook has been offline for a long time. So you are signed out of Outlook according to an existing app protection policy.
- Outlook can't detect whether the Company Portal app is installed after a system update. Because Outlook can't get the expected access token, it goes offline. So you are signed out of Outlook according to an existing app protection policy.

## Solution

To avoid this issue in the future, complete these steps on the Android device:

1. Turn off battery optimization for Outlook and Company Portal.
2. Change app **Launch** setting for Outlook and Company Portal from **Automatic** to **Manage Manually**. Then, enable the following the **Manage Manually** options:
   - Auto-launch
   - Secondary launch
   - Run in background
3. If you have Data Saver enabled, select Outlook and Company Portal for unrestricted data usage.
4. Enable notification for Outlook and Company Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you also do these steps for other apps that are managed by Intune APP.
