## Cause

This issue occurs if the **Default Web Site** name in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager was changed.

The following is an example that shows that the name was changed to **Default Web Site1**:

## Solution

To fix the issue, follow these steps to restore the **Default Web Site** name to its default value.

1. Open IIS Manager.
2. Expand \<*Server Name*>\\**Sites**, and then locate the default website.

    If multiple websites are listed, do the following for each site:

    - Right-click the site, and then select **Manage Website** > **Advanced Settings**.

    Find the default website whose ID is **1**.

3. Right-click the default web site, select **Rename**, and then change the name to **Default Web Site**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You might receive an error message that resembles **Unable to connect to Default Web Site1**. You can ignore this message.

4. After you change the **Default Web Site** name, restart NDESConnectorSetup.exe to install the Intune Certificate Connector.
