# Unexpected error when you sign in to the NDES Connector UI

This article fixes an issue in which you receive an unexpected error and and error 0x80004003 when you sign in to the Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES) Connector UI when you configure NDES.

## Symptoms

When you configure NDES for Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate deployment in Microsoft Intune, you receive the following error message when you sign in to the NDES Connector UI (NDESConnectorUI.exe):

> An unexpected error has occurred

Error entries that resemble the following are logged in the NDES Connector .svclog file:

> NDES Connector certificate could not be found
>
> \<Source Name="NDESConnectorService" />\<Correlation ActivityID="{\<Correlation ActivityID>}" />\<Execution ProcessName="NDESConnector" ProcessID="7364" ThreadID="50" />\<Channel/>\<Computer>Computer_Name\</Computer>\</System>\<ApplicationData>Writing registry SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MicrosoftIntune\NDESConnector\ConnectionStatus - IssueDetails with the value **0x80004003**.

> [!NOTE]
> The NDES Connector .svclog files are located in the following folder on the computer that runs the Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector:
> `%programfiles%\Microsoft Intune\NDESConnectorSvc\Logs\Logs\`.
>
> These files are named in the format: NDESConnector_*YYYY*-*MM*-*DD*_*xxxxxx*.svclog

## Cause

This issue occurs if the account that you use to sign in doesn't have a valid Intune license.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, assign a valid Intune license to the account that you use to sign in.

> [!NOTE]
> The account that you use to sign in must be an Intune Service Administrator or a tenant administrator that has **Global Administrator** permissions.
