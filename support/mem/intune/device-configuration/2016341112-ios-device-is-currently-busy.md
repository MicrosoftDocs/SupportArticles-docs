# iOS device is currently busy error when you deploy a device profile to an iOS device

This article discusses the **2016341112 -iOS device is currently busy** error that can occur when deploying a device configuration profile to iOS devices in Microsoft Intune.

## Symptoms

When you try to deploy a device configuration profile to iOS devices in Intune, you notice the following behavior:

- When the iOS device is locked, the device profile isn't applied to the device. In the Microsoft Intune admin center, the device is marked as noncompliant, and you see the following error message:

    > 2016341112 -iOS device is currently busy

    > [!NOTE]
    > This issue occurs even if the device is connected to the Internet and has the **Background App Refresh** setting turned on.

- When the iOS device is unlocked, the profile is applied to the device successfully.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the iOS device is busy and can't complete evaluation or enforcement of the profile. This error typically occurs when an iOS device has been powered on but not unlocked, or when a device is currently installing an app or iOS update.

## More information

This is a function of the iOS platform and not specific to Intune. After the device is unlocked, the profile will be applied.

There are certain times when a device cannot do what the server requests. When the device can't follow a command, it sends a **NotNow** status.

|Status value|Description|
|---|---|
|NotNow|The device received the command, but it cannot follow the command at this time. The device will poll the server again later.|
