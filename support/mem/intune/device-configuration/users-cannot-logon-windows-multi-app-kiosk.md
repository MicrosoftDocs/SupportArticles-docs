# Users can't log on to Windows if a multi-app kiosk profile is assigned

This article helps you fix an issue in which a user can't log on to a Microsoft Entra joined Windows 10 computer if a multi-app kiosk profile is assigned.

## Symptoms

When a user tries to log on to a Microsoft Entra joined Windows 10 computer that has a multi-app kiosk profile assigned, the attempt fails immediately before the user profile is loaded.

In this situation, the kiosk profile logon type is **Microsoft Entra user** or **Group**. Additionally, the Windows 10 computer uses a local account, and you notice the following error messages in the Event Viewer logs:

## Cause

This behavior is by design.

This issue occurs because the users are targeted by conditional access policies that require user interaction. For example, multi-factor authentication (MFA), or Terms of Use (TOU).

## Solution

To fix this issue, exclude the kiosk users from any conditional access policies that require user interaction, such as MFA or TOU.

If the kiosk user is enabled for MFA, disable it because MFA is currently not supported in multi-app kiosk mode scenarios.
