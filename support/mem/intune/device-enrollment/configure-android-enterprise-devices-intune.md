# End-to-end guide for configuring Android enterprise devices in Microsoft Intune 

This guide helps administrators understand how to configure and troubleshoot Android enterprise devices in a Microsoft Intune environment. It covers the following common scenarios:

- Onboarding to Google
- Application deployment
- Enabling work profile enrollment
- Configuring conditional access
- The work profile enrollment end-user experience
- Issuing a work profile passcode reset 

It helps you decide which management capability is the best for your organization and provides a FAQ about Android enterprise.

## Evaluate your needs

Before you enable Android enterprise devices in Intune, you must determine whether you want to enroll those devices as personal devices (Bring Your Own Device, or BYOD) or as corporate devices. 

### BYOD devices

BYOD devices are set up to have an Android Enterprise work profile. This feature is built into Android 5.1 and later versions. This feature allows work apps and data to be stored in a separate, self-contained, company-managed space on the device. Because personal apps and data remain on the device inside the user's personal profile, employees can continue to use their device as they usually would.

### Corporate devices

There are two options for corporate-owned devices, and each of them serves a unique use case:

- **Dedicated devices** (formerly known as COSU, or Corporate Owned Single Use). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The example used in this guide focuses on BYOD scenarios. For more information about dedicated devices (COSU) scenarios, see [COSU Configuration and Enrollment using the QR code enrollment method](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/COSU-Configuration-and-Enrollment-using-the-QR-code-enrollment/bc-p/286905).

   Dedicated devices are typically locked to a single app or set of apps (also known as kiosk mode). It allows the administrator to control things such as the status bar, keyboard layouts, the lock screen, and other settings on the device. It prevents users from enabling other apps or changing certain settings on dedicated devices. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > Devices that you manage in this manner are enrolled in Intune without a user account and aren't associated with any end-user. They aren't intended for personal use applications or apps that have a strong requirement for user-specific account data such as Outlook or Gmail.

- **Fully managed devices** (formerly known as COBO, or Corporate Owned Business Only). 

   > [!NOTE]
   > For more information about fully managed devices, see [Set up Intune enrollment of Android Enterprise fully managed devices](/mem/intune/enrollment/android-fully-managed-enroll).

   Fully managed devices fit into a more user-centric scenario. A single user is associated with the device while the admin still retains full control over the device (as opposed to a work-profile scenario, in which multiple users have control).

When you decide how to enroll your devices, be aware that not all features are available for both methods. The following table shows some key differences.

## Connect an Intune account to an Android enterprise account

The first step to configure Android enterprise in your environment is to connect your Intune tenant account to your Android enterprise account:

1. Create a Google service account (@gmail.com).
   > [!NOTE]
   > This account will be associated with all Android enterprise management tasks for your tenant. It is the Google account that your company's IT admins will share to manage and publish apps in the Google Play console. You can use an existing Google account or create a new one. The account that you use must not be associated with a G-Suite domain.

2. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://endpoint.microsoft.com/) by using your Intune-licensed Global Administrator account.

3. Go to **Devices** > **Android** > **Android Enrollment** > **Managed Google Play**, select **I agree**, and then select **Launch Google to connect now** to open the Managed Google Play website.

## Frequently asked questions

- **Question**: Why are apps that I unapproved from the Google Play for Work store not being removed from the Mobile Apps page in the Intune Admin Portal?

  **Answer**: This behavior is expected.

- **Question**: Why are managed Google Play apps not reporting under **Discovered Apps** in the Intune portal?

  **Answer**: This behavior is expected.

- **Question**: Why are managed Google Play apps that aren't deployed through Intune displayed in the work profile?

  **Answer**: System apps can be enabled in the work profile by the device OEM at the time that the work profile is created. It isn't controlled by the MDM provider.

  To troubleshoot, follow these steps: 

  1. Collect Company Portal logs.
  2. Note any apps that appear unexpectedly in the work profile.
  3. Unenroll the device from Intune and uninstall the Company Portal.
  4. Install the [Test DPC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc) app that allows creation of a work profile without an EMM for testing.
  5. Follow the instructions in [Test DPC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.afwsamples.testdpc) to create a work profile on the device.
  6. Review apps that appear in the work profile.   
  7. If the same applications show in the Test DPC app, the apps are expected by the OEM for that device.

- **Question**: Why is the Wipe (Factory Reset) option not available for my work profile enrolled device?

  **Answer**: This behavior is expected. In the work profile scenario, the MDM provider doesn't have full control over the device. The only option available is Retire (Remove Company Data) which removes the whole work profile and all its contents.

- **Question**: Why can't I find file path Internal storage/Android/Data.com.microsoft.windowsintune.companyportal/files on my work profile enrolled device to manually collect Company Portal Logs?

  **Answer**: This behavior is expected. This path is only created for the Device Admin (Legacy Android Enrollment) scenario.

  To collect logs, follow these steps: 
   
  1. In the Company Portal app with the badge, tap **Menu** > **Help** > **Email Support**, and then tap **Send Email & Upload logs**. 
  2. When you are prompted with **Send help request with**, select one of the Email apps.   
  3. An email is generated to your IT admin with an incident ID that can be provided to Microsoft product support.

- **Question**: I checked the Managed Google Play Last Sync time and it hasn't been updated in days. Why?

  **Answer**: This behavior is expected. The sync is only triggered when you manually do so.

- **Question**: Are Web Applications supported for work profile-enrolled devices?

  **Answer**: Yes. Web apps (or web links) are supported for all Android Enterprise scenarios.

- **Question**: Is the device passcode reset supported?

  **Answer**: For work profile-enrolled devices, you can reset the work profile passcode only on devices that are running Android 8.0+ if the work profile passcode is managed and the user has allowed you to reset it. For dedicated and fully managed devices, device passcode reset is supported.

- **Question**: My device is required to be encrypted upon enrollment. Is there an option to turn off encryption?

  **Answer**: No. Encryption is required by Google for the work profile. 

- **Question**:  Why are Samsung devices blocking the use of third-party keyboards like SwiftKey?

  **Answer**: Samsung began enforcing this on Android 8.0+ devices. Microsoft is currently working with Samsung on this issue and will post new information when it's available.
