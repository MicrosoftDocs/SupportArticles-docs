# Unblock Windows "Set up for work or school" enrollment

This article helps troubleshoot an enrollment failure during the out-of-box experience (OOBE) when enrolling Windows devices with a work or school account.

This issue can occur during device setup when the user chooses **Set up for work or school** and then signs in with an organization-linked Microsoft Entra account. The enrollment fails and you might see associated error code 80180014.

## Cause

In this scenario, the device is recognized as a *personal* device. If you have personal device enrollment blocked for your tenant, this enrollment method will result in a failure.

## Solution

To fix this issue, you can allow personal enrollment of Windows devices either for all users or for a subset of users you want to be allowed to enroll personal devices. We recommend limiting the number of users you allow to enroll personal windows devices to only the users who will need this capability. This will ensure that other users in your organization don't accidentally enroll their personal devices.

To allow personal device enrollment, sign-in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) and select **Devices** > **Enroll devices** > **Enrollment device platform restrictions**.

Select **Windows restrictions** > **Create restriction** and give the restriction an informative name. On the **Platform settings** page, make sure to set **Personally owned devices** to **Allow**.

Assign the restriction to the group(s) you want to let enroll personal devices.

Review and create the restriction.
