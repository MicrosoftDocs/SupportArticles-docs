# Make your Intune support call more effective

This article describes things to try before you call Microsoft Intune support to resolve issues that affect Intune.

When you [contact Microsoft Support](/mem/intune/fundamentals/get-support) about issues that affect Microsoft Intune, Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), mobile device management (MDM), or app protection policies (APP, also referred to as MAM), there are several things that you can do to help us resolve your incident more quickly. Providing us with this information up front is a great way to work toward a resolution.

## Issue description

An accurate description of your issue or question can give your support engineer important information to research before you're even contacted. By having this information in hand, we might be able to provide an answer when we call you back. The more information that you can give us when the case is opened, the better our chance of quickly resolving the issue.

It's always best if you can be as specific as possible. It also helps for you to tell us what you are ultimately trying to accomplish. Does your issue affect device management, application management, enrollment, or administration? Also, tell us the device types, operating systems, affected applications, observed behavior, expected behavior, and any other details that you believe are relevant to the issue.

## Visual documentation

Screen captures can often eliminate any vagueness or misunderstanding when we work on an issue. We always appreciate getting screenshots, especially when they're included at the time that the support ticket is opened. Any files that you upload to your case during the ticket submission process are saved securely to protect your company and personal information.

You can use the Windows Steps Recorder to easily record the exact steps and images to reproduce the issue. Depending on your system, this tool may be called the **Problem Steps Recorder** or **Steps Recorder**. The easiest way to find it is to type **steps** in Start menu search or Cortana.

## Required information

We will always require the following information:

- The name of your tenant (for example, *contoso.onmicrosoft.com*).
- Your MDM authority.
- Issue history: Has this feature, device, or process ever worked?
- Is the company portal application updated to the latest version?
- Questions specific to device management and application management:

  - **Device management**

    Have you followed all the steps in the following article for your device type?
