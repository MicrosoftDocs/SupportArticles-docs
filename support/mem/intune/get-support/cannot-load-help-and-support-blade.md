# You cannot load the Microsoft Intune Help and support blade

This article gives a solution for when the **Help and support** blade doesn't load in the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## Symptoms

You experience one of the following issues:

- You cannot load the **Help and support** blade in the Intune portal.
- You receive a **login.microsoftonline.com refused to connect** error message in browsers such as Chrome or Firefox. Other browsers such as Safari or Microsoft Edge may display similar errors or nothing at all.

The exact symptom may differ depending on the browser. However, the overall problem is that the **Help and support** blade doesn't load correctly even when you use a Global Administrator account.
