# Intune troubleshooting portal fails to load for help desk operators

This article helps Intune Administrators resolve an issue in which the Intune **Troubleshoot** pane fails to load for help desk operators.

## Symptoms

When a user signs in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) as a **Help Desk Operator** role member, and goes to the Intune troubleshooting portal, the **Troubleshoot** pane displays a banner that states **Account status You do not have enough permissions**, and no user or device data is displayed.

## Cause

The user is not licensed for Intune.

2. On the **Intune** pane, go to **Users** > **All Users**.
3. Select the user for whom the **Troubleshoot** pane fails to load.
