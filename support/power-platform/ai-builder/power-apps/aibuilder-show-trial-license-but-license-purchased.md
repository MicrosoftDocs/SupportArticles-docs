# AI Builder trial license still displays in the top banner after you've purchased an AI Builder license

This article explains why the AI Builder trial license still displays in the top banner after you've purchased an AI Builder license.

_Applies to:_ AI Builder

## Symptoms

You've purchased a Power Apps license as a user but the app still says trial.

## Cause

If you've purchased a premium Power Apps license, you got a small number of AI Builder credits.

## Resolution

The trial message will disappear at the end of your trial period, and you'll use your seeded credits instead.
