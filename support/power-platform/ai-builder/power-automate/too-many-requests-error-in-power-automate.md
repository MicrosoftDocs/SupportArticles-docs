# Too many requests error in Power Automate

This article provides a solution when you receive a *too many requests* error.

*Applies to:* &nbsp; Power Automate

## Symptoms

You get the error "429 â€“ TooManyRequests".

## Cause

You've performed too many executions in a short time frame on a model.

## Resolution

If this error occurs, decrease the concurrency level of your flow. For example, if your flow is triggered by the action, **When a file is created in a folder** when using the SharePoint trigger, you can reduce the degree of parallelism in the action settings.

1. Select "..." on the **When a file is created in a folder** window and select **Settings**.
