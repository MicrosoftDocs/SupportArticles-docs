# Your model uses a preview functionality which has expired

This article provides a resolution for an issue where a model uses a preview functionality which has expired and causes the model to stop functioning.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Automate, Power Apps, document processing models

## Symptoms

On the model's detail page, a message bar indicates that the model uses a preview functionality which has expired.

## Cause

When a model has been created using a preview model template, it could be necessary to retrain the model when the model template becomes generally available.

## Resolution

1. To solve this issue, select **Edit model** on the model's detail page.

1. Go through the wizard without necessarily making any changes, and retrain the model. 

1. If you want to use the model in an app or a flow, publish it after training.

## Resources

For more information, go to [Train a document processing model](/ai-builder/form-processing-train).
