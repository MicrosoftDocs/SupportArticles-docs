## Error - IncomingEmailRejected

When you try to install Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, the **Status** column shows **Issue when adding to Outlook**. When you select the **Learn more** link, you see a dialog with the following details:

> There was an issue when attempting to add the app to Outlook.  
> Crm : IncomingEmailRejected

### Cause

This error can occur due to one of the following reasons:

- The email address for the mailbox record in Dynamics 365 isn't approved.
- The Exchange mailbox is currently linked to another Dynamics 365 organization. An Exchange mailbox (email address) can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one organization, and a user that belongs to that organization can only synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks with one Exchange mailbox.

### Resolution

Verify the email address for the mailbox is approved and associated with the desired Dynamics 365 organization.

1. Sign in to Dynamics 365 as a user with the System Administrator role.
2. Select **Settings** > **Email Configuration**.

3. Within the **Email Configuration** area, select **Mailboxes** and then change the view from **My Active Mailboxes** to **Active Mailboxes**.
4. Select the mailbox record that encountered the error and then select **Approve Email**.
5. After the email address is approved, select the **Test & Enable Mailboxes** button.

6. Within the **Test Email Configuration** dialog, make sure to select the [Sync items with Exchange from this Dynamics 365 Organization only, even if Exchange was set to sync with a different org](/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/admin/when-would-want-use-check-box) checkbox and then select **OK**.

7. After the mailbox has completed testing, try to install Dynamics 365 App for Outlook again. This can be located by selecting **Settings** and then selecting **Dynamics 365 App for Outlook**.
