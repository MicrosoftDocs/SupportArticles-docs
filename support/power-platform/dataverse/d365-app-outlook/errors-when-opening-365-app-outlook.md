_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4345548

## Symptoms

When trying to open the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook, you might receive an error message.

If an error occurs, check for a **Help me resolve this issue** link. Selecting this link will direct you to an article created to help solve the specific error if Microsoft is aware of a potential solution.

## Resolution 2 - Clear your browser cache

### For Microsoft 365 version 16.0.11629 and Windows 10 version 1903 or later

Follow these steps as Office Add-ins are now using [Microsoft Edge WebView](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/blogs/microsoft-edge-webview-for-office-add-ins/):

1. Install [Microsoft Edge DevTools Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/p/microsoft-edge-devtools-preview/9mzbfrmz0mnj#activetab=pivot:overviewtab).
2. In Outlook, open the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook.
3. Run Microsoft Edge DevTools Preview.
4. You should see Dynamics 365 (EXP) as a debug target.
5. Select it to open the **F12** tools.
6. Go to the **Console** tab.
7. Run the `window.localStorage.clear()`.
8. Reopen the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook in Outlook.

### For earlier versions of Microsoft 365 and Windows

|Platform|Instructions|
|---|---|
| Internet Explorer or Outlook| [View and delete your browsing history in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/view-and-delete-your-browsing-history-in-internet-explorer-098ffe52-5ac9-a449-c296-c735c32c8678) |
| Microsoft Edge| [View and delete browser history in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4) |
| Goole Chrome| [Clear cache & cookies in Goole Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although other browsers might be installed on your computer, the Outlook desktop client always uses Internet Explorer to display web content, such as the content inside the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook. However, starting with Microsoft 365 version 16.0.11629, this is no longer the case. This means that Outlook desktop no longer relies solely on Internet Explorer for displaying web content and might use other browsers or web technologies instead.

After clearing your browser cache, close all Internet Explorer and Outlook desktop windows. Ensure through Task Manager that no Internet Explorer processes are running.

### Use the F12 IEchooser (not applicable for Windows 7)

If this issue only appears in the Outlook desktop client and clearing the cache via Internet Options doesn't help, try clearing it via F12 IEchooser (not applicable for Windows 7):

1. Open the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook in the Outlook desktop client.
2. Open the **IEChooser.exe** located in `%WindowsFolder%\System32\F12` (for example: `C:\Windows\System32\F12`).
3. In the **Choose target to debug** window, select **Dynamics 365**.
4. Select the **Network** tab and then select the **Clear cache** button.

After completing the steps above, reopen Outlook and the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to check if the issue is resolved.
