To sovle this issue, run the following command in a command prompt:

`icacls %userprofile%\Appdata\LocalLow /t /setintegritylevel (OI)(CI)L`

> Error: QuotaExceededError

The error indicates that your local browser storage is exceeded.

### Resolution

To solve this issue, clear your browser cache.

| Platform| Instructions |
|---|---|
| Internet Explorer or Outlook| [View and delete your browsing history in Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/view-and-delete-your-browsing-history-in-internet-explorer-098ffe52-5ac9-a449-c296-c735c32c8678) |
| Microsoft Edge| [View and delete browser history in Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/view-and-delete-browser-history-in-microsoft-edge-00cf7943-a9e1-975a-a33d-ac10ce454ca4) |
| Google Chrome| [Clear cache & cookies in Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although you might have other browsers installed on your computer, the Outlook desktop always uses Internet Explorer when displaying web content, such as inside the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook.

After clearing your browser cache, close all Internet Explorer and Outlook desktop windows, and ensure there are no remaining Internet Explorer processes running by checking Task Manager.

If this issue only exits in the Outlook desktop client and clearing the cache via Internet Options doesn't help, try clearing it via the F12 IEchooser (not applicable for Windows 7):

1. Open the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook in the Outlook desktop client.
2. Open the **IEChooser.exe** located in `%WindowsFolder%\System32\F12` (for example, `C:\Windows\System32\F12`).
3. In the **Choose target to debug** window, select **Dynamics 365**.
4. Select the **Network** tab and then select the **Clear cache** button.

After completing these steps, reopen Outlook and the Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to see if the issue is resolved.

## Cause 4 - Third-party cookies are blocked in your browser settings
