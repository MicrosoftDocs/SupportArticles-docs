# Dataverse records are created without required fields

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dataverse

## Symptoms

After users input data through the [Microsoft Dataverse Web API](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/webapi/overview), some required fields are missing or not populated in the created records. For example, the required **Case Title** field is blank in a created case, as shown in the following screenshot.

When you open the affected case, you must enter a value for the **Case Title** field.

## Cause

This issue occurs if the records are created from a third-party tool such as Postman. Such tools don't check for the required fields. Instead, they send the data as is.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, make sure that you check the following items:

- Check that the required fields are included in the flows.
- Check for the existence of required fields in the entities that are created through HTTP requests.
