# Test and Enable fails due to unrecognized Microsoft 365 User Email Address

## Symptoms

When attempting to perform Test and Enable on a mailbox in Dataverse, users may encounter the following error message:

>Test and Enable failed because no user was found with the email address "<user@domain.com>" in the Microsoft 365 tenant associated with this mailbox's Email Server Profile. Verify the user exists in [...]

## Cause

This error typically occurs when:

- The specified email address does not exist in the Microsoft 365 tenant linked to the mailbox's Email Server Profile.
- The email address is not properly configured as a User Principal Name (UPN), SMTP address, or Mail address on the user object.
- The mailbox belongs to a different Microsoft 365 tenant, and a Cross Tenant Email Server Profile has not been configured.

## Resolution

**Step 1: Validate User Existence and Email Address Configuration**

An administrator should verify that the user exists in the correct Microsoft 365 tenant and that the email address is properly configured.

To validate UPN, SMTP, or Mail address:

1. Sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
2. Navigate to **Users > Active Users**.
3. Search for the user using the email address in question.
4. Open the user profile and confirm the user has at least one email address matching the email address in the Dataverse mailbox record:
    - User Principal Name (UPN) or Username matches the email address.
    - In the **Mail** tab, click **Edit Exchange properties**. In **Manage mailboxes**, open the mailbox. On the **General** tab, confirm the **User ID** or the **Email addresses** properties contain the email address.
    - **Note:** If a matching address is found in the **Email addresses**, click **Manage email address types** to confirm the address type is “SMTP”.

If the user exists in the same tenant as your Dataverse instance but does not have a matching UPN, SMTP, or Mail email address, update the Dataverse mailbox record to a valid email address for the user.

If the user does not exist in the same tenant as your Dataverse instance, proceed to **Step 2**.

**Step 2: Configure Cross Tenant Email Server Profile**

If the mailbox resides in a different Microsoft 365 tenant, you must configure a Cross Tenant Email Server Profile.

Refer to the following documentation:
