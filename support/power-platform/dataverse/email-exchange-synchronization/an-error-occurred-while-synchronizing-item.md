- > An internal Microsoft Dynamics 365 error occurred while receiving email through the mailbox \<Mailbox Name\>. The owner of the associated email server profile \<Profile Name\> has been notified. The system will try to receive email again later.
  >
  > **Email Server Error Code**: IncomingMailboxInternalCrmError

- > An unexpected error occurred while receiving email. Mailbox \<Mailbox Name\> didn't synchronize. The owner of the associated email server profile \<Profile Name\> has been notified.
  >

## Cause

The error messages might occur when [server-side synchronization](/power-platform/admin/server-side-synchronization) tries to synchronize an item with Microsoft Exchange but encounters issues such as internal errors or a 503 (Service Unavailable) error. Typically, these are temporary problems, and synchronization usually succeeds in the next cycle (approximately every 15 minutes).

## Resolution

- If the issue doesn't persist during the next synchronization cycle (typically in 15 minutes), you can ignore it.
- If the issue persists and the mentioned item isn't being synchronized by server-side synchronization, you can contact Microsoft Support through the **Help + Support** experience in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support). 
- Additionally, there might be an issue with your email server, so you can first verify that you can send and receive emails successfully with your email service.
