# "Appointments, contacts, and tasks for the mailbox couldn't be synchronized" error occurs in Dynamics 365

This article provides a workaround for the issue that appointments aren't synchronized from Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Exchange for some users.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics 365  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4494491

## Symptoms

Appointments aren't synchronized from Dynamics 365 to Exchange for some users. If you [view the Alerts](/power-platform/admin/monitor-email-processing-errors#view-alerts) for a corresponding mailbox in Dynamics 365, you see the following alert message:

> Appointments, contacts, and tasks for the mailbox \<Mailbox Name> couldn't be synchronized. The owner of the associated email server profile \<Profile Name> has been notified. The system will try again later.  
> **Email Server Error Code:** Exchange.server returned 383 error.

## Cause

Microsoft is aware of an [issue with the Exchange Web Services API](https://github.com/OfficeDev/ews-managed-api/issues/161) that can cause this error if one of the following time zones are used:

- (GMT-05:00) Chetumal - Eastern Standard Time (Mexico)

## Workaround

If you're in one of the impacted time zones, you can work around the issue by changing the user's time zone setting in Dynamics 365:

1. A Dynamics 365 user can access their personal options by selecting the gear icon in the upper-right corner of Dynamics 365 and then selecting **Options**.

2. If the **Time Zone** value is one of the time zones listed in the **Cause** section of this article, update the value to another time zone that has the same time offset but isn't in the list.

   For example, if you're using **(GMT-05:00)** Chetumal, you could try switching to **(GMT-05:00)** Havana.

3. Select **OK**.

4. The appointments should synchronize on the next synchronization cycle for the mailbox, which might take 15 to 30 minutes.
