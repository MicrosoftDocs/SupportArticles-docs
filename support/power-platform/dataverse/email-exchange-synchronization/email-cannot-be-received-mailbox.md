## Cause

This error can occur if the server location or port in the email server profile aren't correct.

## Resolution

1. Navigate to **Settings**, **Email Configuration**, and then select **Email Server Profiles**.

    > You can also select the name of the Email Server Profile within the error message. It appears as a hyperlink which will open the correct Email Server Profile record.

3. Verify the **Incoming Server Location** value.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Refer to the documentation from your email provider for the correct addresses. For [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7104828), the incoming server location would be `pop.gmail.com` and the outgoing server location would be `smtp.gmail.com`.

4. Select **Advanced**.  

5. Verify the **Incoming Port** value and then select **Save**.
