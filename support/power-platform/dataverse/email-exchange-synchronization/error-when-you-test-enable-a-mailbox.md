# "The mailbox user doesn't have sufficient permissions" error when you test and enable a mailbox

This article provides a solution to a permissions error that occurs when you try to test and enable a mailbox in Microsoft Dynamics 365.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics 365  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4052824

## Symptoms

When you try to [test and enable a mailbox](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online#test-the-configuration-of-mailboxes) in Dynamics 365, the following alert is logged:

> Appointments, contacts, and tasks can't be synchronized for the mailbox \<Mailbox Name> because the mailbox user doesn't have sufficient permissions on this mailbox.
>
> **Email Server Error Code:** Crm.80048306.Not enough privilege to access the Microsoft Dynamics 365 object or perform the requested operation.

If you select to view the details, the following extra details are shown:

## Cause

The Dynamics 365 user associated with the mailbox doesn't have sufficient privileges. This issue often occurs because the user doesn't have a security role assigned or their security role lacks user-level read or write access to the `Mailbox` entity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Verify that the owner of the mailbox record matches the user. For example, if the mailbox belongs to Paul Cannon, ensure that the **Owner** value in the record is also Paul Cannon. If it shows a different user, that user might not have access to Paul Cannon's mailbox.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the mailbox record as a user with the "System Administrator" role in Dynamics 365.
    > [!TIP]
    > The alert includes a link to the mailbox record.

2. Verify that the **Owner** field in the mailbox form has the user's name. If another name is listed, change it to the user's name.
3. Select the link in the **Owner** field to open the user record for the owning user.
4. Select **Manage Roles** to see which security role(s) are assigned to the user.
5. Navigate to **Settings**, select **Security**, and then select **Security roles**.

6. Open the roles found in step 4. See [PrivilegeDenied error occurs when using server-side synchronization](/previous-versions/troubleshoot/dynamics/crm/privilegedenied-error-when-using-server-side-sync) for a list of required privileges, and then verify that the user's security role contains these privileges.

7. After verifying that the user is the owner of the mailbox record and that their security role contains the required privileges, select the **Test & Enable Mailbox** button in the mailbox record again. If the test doesn't result in **Success**, review the message shown in the **Alerts** section.
