# "Mailbox does not have an email server profile or the email server profile is inactive" error when testing a mailbox

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when you test and enable a mailbox in Microsoft Dynamics 365.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics 365  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4484702

## Symptoms

When you try to [test and enable a mailbox](/power-platform/admin/connect-exchange-online#test-the-configuration-of-mailboxes) in Dynamics 365, the test results show as **Failure**. The following error message is logged in the [Alerts](/power-platform/admin/monitor-email-processing-errors#view-alerts) section of the mailbox:

> Email cannot be received because the mailbox \<Mailbox Name\> does not have an email server profile associated with it or the email server profile is inactive.  
> **Email Server Error Code:** InvalidIncomingEmailServerProfile

## Cause

This error occurs if the user's mailbox record in Dynamics 365 lacks a value specified for the **Server Profile** field or the associated server profile is deactivated.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> To manage security roles and mailbox settings, you need to sign in to your Dynamics 365 organization as a user with the "System Administrator" role.

1. Open the mailbox record in Dynamics 365 and verify that a value is selected for the **Server Profile** field.

2. If a value is already selected, open the associated server profile and review its **Status** at the bottom of the page.

3. If the email server profile shows an **Inactive** status, follow these steps to activate it:

    1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Email Configuration** > **Email Server Profiles**.
    2. Switch the view to **Inactive Email Server Profiles**.
    3. Select the email server profile, and then select **Activate** > **OK**.

4. Switch back to the mailbox record, and then select the **Test & Enable Mailbox** button.
5. If any test results still show as **Failure**, check the **Alerts** section for more information.
