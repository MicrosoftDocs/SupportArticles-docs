# A "Tracked to Dynamics 365" category is unexpectedly added to a user's mailbox

This article helps you understand why users see the Outlook category called **Tracked to Dynamics 365** when they're configured to use server-side synchronization with Microsoft Dynamics 365. It also provides information on how an administrator can disable category-based tracking.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Microsoft Dynamics 365  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4501716

## Symptoms

Users configured to use server-side synchronization with Dynamics 365 might see a category called **Tracked to Dynamics 365** in their Exchange mailbox and Outlook. For example, when a user uses the **Categorize** option in Outlook on an item such as an email message or appointment, they'll see the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category.

When viewing [the Alerts area for a user's mailbox](/power-platform/admin/monitor-email-processing-errors#view-alerts), you might see the following information level alert message:

> Outlook Category "Tracked To Dynamics 365" has been enabled for the mailbox \<Mailbox Name\> as the OrgDBOrgSetting is enabled. Use this Outlook category to track emails, appointments and tasks.

## Cause

Server-side synchronization allows tracking of emails, appointments, and tasks in Outlook with a [special category](https://support.microsoft.com/office/set-categories-flags-or-reminders-a894348d-b308-4185-840f-aff63063d076): **Tracked to Dynamics 365**. As of version 9.1.0.4039 or later, the category-based tracking feature is on by default. For more information, see [Use Outlook category to track appointments and emails](/power-platform/admin/use-outlook-category-track-appointments-emails).

## Resolution

As an administrator, you can disable the feature in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) or by setting `TrackCategorizedItems` to **False** using the OrgDBOrgSettings tool.

### Disable the "Tracked to Dynamics 365" category in the Power Platform admin center

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
2. Select **Environments** on the left navigation pane, select an environment, and then select **Settings**.
3. Under the **Email** section, select **Email tracking**.
4. Locate the **People can use categories to track emails and appointments** option and switch it to **Off**.

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling the feature removes the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category from all Exchange mailboxes of the organization that have server-side synchronization enabled in about 15 minutes.

### Disable the "Tracked to Dynamics 365" category using OrgDBOrgSetting TrackCategorizedItems

Dynamics 365 provides the OrgDBOrgSettings tool, allowing administrators to implement specific updates that were previously reserved for registry implementations.

To disable the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** Outlook category, install the OrgDBOrgSettings tool in your organization and set the value of `TrackCategorizedItems` to **False** to remove the category tracking flag and functionality as described in [OrgDBOrgSettings tool for Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2691237/orgdborgsettings-tool-for-microsoft-dynamics-crm).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Disabling OrgDBOrgSetting `TrackCategorizedItems` removes the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category from all Exchange mailboxes of the organization that have server-side synchronization enabled in about 15 minutes.
> - If you disable OrgDBOrgSetting `TrackCategorizedItems`, the **Tracked to Dynamics 365** category is soft-deleted, with the category assignment retained in Outlook. If you delete the category from the master list, it will be deleted permanently.

Instead of using the command-line option, you can also use [OrgDBOrgSetting/Releases](https://github.com/seanmcne/OrgDbOrgSettings/releases/) to edit OrgDBOrgSetting `TrackCategorizedItems`.
