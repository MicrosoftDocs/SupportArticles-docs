# Environment schema type mismatch warning during solution import

This article provides a workaround for an issue about environment [schema type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/organizationdetail?view=dataverse-latest#remarks) mistamch that occurs when you [import a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions) in Microsoft Power Apps. You can still proceed with the solution import but this will help to avoid component missing due to schema type mismatch.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Platform, Solutions

## Symptoms

When you try to import a solution in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), you receive a warning like the following one:

> This solution was exported from a [source environment schema type] environment, which has more components tham the current [target environment schema type] environment. When you import, some components may be missing.

## Cause

The source environment where the solution is developed has a schema type which has more components than the target environment which has a schema type with lesser components. The solution might (or might not) take a dependency on a component which is present in source environment but is missing in the target environment.

This warning ensures that the user understand the drawbacks of having source and development environment with different schema types. 

## Workaround

To work around this issue, choose same schema type for both source environment and target environment. If you have different schema type for source and target environments, consider changing to new environments for development to match with production environment. 
The warning does not confirms missing dependencies during solution import due to dependencies on component present in source environment, rather this warning guides customer to do best practice to setup source and target environment correctly for avoiding future risks of missing dependencies.
