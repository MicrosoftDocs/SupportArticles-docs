# Environment schema type mismatch warning during solution import

This article provides a workaround for an issue about source environment's [schema type](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/reference/organizationdetail?view=dataverse-latest#remarks) higher than target environment's schema type that occurs when you [import a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions) in Microsoft Power Platform. You can still proceed with the solution import if there are no other errors, but this warning helps guide you to avoid missing components due to schema type mismatch for future imports.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Platform, Solutions

## Symptoms

When you try to import a solution in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), you might receive the following warning:

> This solution was exported from a [source environment schema type] environment, which has more components than the current [target environment schema type] environment. When you import, some components might be missing.

## Cause

This issue could be caused due to the source environment, from which the solution is exported, has a higher schema type than the target environment. The higher schema type includes more components than the lower schema type of the target environment. Consequently, the solution might depend on components available in the source environment but absent in the target environment, leading to missing dependencies.

For example, a `Full` schema type has more components than a `Standard` schema type, and a `Standard` schema type has more components than a `Core` schema type.

This warning ensures that you understand the drawbacks of having source and development environments with different schema types.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, ensure the schema type of the source environment is either the same or lower than that of the target environment. If the source environment's schema type is higher, consider adjusting it to match the target environment's schema type.

> [!NOTE]
> The warning doesn't confirm missing dependencies during solution import due to dependencies on components present in the source environment. Instead, this warning serves as a best practice guideline to properly configure source and target environments, reducing the risk of future missing dependencies.
