# Environment version mismatch warning during solution import

This article provides a workaround for an issue about a solution import target environment's possible missing components due to a lower Microsoft Dataverse version than the source environment. This issue occurs when you [import a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions) in Microsoft Power Apps. You can still proceed with the solution import if there'ss no other error but this warning helps guide you to avoid components missing due to a different Dataverse version.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Platform, Solutions

## Symptoms

When you try to import a solution in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), you receive a warning like this:

> This solution was exported from an environment with a more recent version [source environment Dataverse version] of Dataverse than the current environment, which has version [target environment Dataverse version]. This can cause issues with missing dependencies.

## Cause

The source environment where the solution is developed has a later (higher) Dataverse version, which might have components that the target environment with a earlier (lower) Dataverse version doesn't. The solution might (or might not) take a dependency on a component, which is present in the source environment but is missing in the target environment and could result in missing dependencies. This issue can occur when you export a solution from an environment located in the Canada region and import into the North America region (which likely has an earlier Dataverse version.) 

This warning ensures that you understand the drawbacks of having a source environmen that has an earlier version of Dataverse compared to the target environment.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, choose an environment for development in stations that have the same deployment schedule as the source environment. If the source environment is at lower station, there is a possibility of taking dependencies on components which is released to source environment but not to the target environment yet. Always consider changing your source environment to be in a region within a deployment station that's higher or equal to the target environment. This ensures that target environment has components that are present in the source environment.
The warning doesn't confirms missing dependencies during solution import due to dependencies on component present in the source environment. Instead this warning guides you to do best practices to setup the source and target environments correctly to avoid future risks of missing dependencies.

The [dataverse version](/dynamics365/released-versions/microsoft-dataverse#latest-version-availability) can be determined based on the region where the environment is present. 

### Example

The following example demostrates what happens when your source and target environments are in regions that have different Dataverse versions.

Example 1:
| Environment | Region | Station |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Source| Canada| Station 2|
| Target| North America| Station 5|

Here the source environment is at lower station than the target environment. This can result in source environment's dataverse version to be higher than target environment. Your solution can take dependencies on components present in source environment but not yet available in target environment, when imported to target environment this will cause missing dependencies. To avoid such conditions, consider keeping source enviornment has same or higher version than target environment.

 Example 2:
| Environment | Region | Station |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Source| North America| Station 5|
| Target| India| Station 2|

Here the source environment is at higher station than target environment. This ensures the source environment has the same or lower version than target environment. Target environment always has components present in source environment, and doesn't result in missing dependencies due to source environment having a higher Dataverse version.
