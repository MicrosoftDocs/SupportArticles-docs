# Environment version mismatch warning during solution import

This article provides a workaround for an issue about a solution import target environment might be missing components due to an earlier (lower) version of Microsoft Dataverse than the source environment. This issue occurs when you [import a solution](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/import-update-export-solutions) in Microsoft Power Apps. You can still proceed with the solution import if there are no other errors, but this warning helps guide you to avoid components missing due to a different Dataverse version.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Platform, Solutions

## Symptoms

When you try to import a solution in [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), you might receive the following warning:

> This solution was exported from an environment with a more recent version [source environment Dataverse version] of Dataverse than the current environment, which has version [target environment Dataverse version]. This can cause issues with missing dependencies.

## Cause

This issue could be caused due to the source environment where the solution is developed has a later (higher) [Dataverse version](/dynamics365/released-versions/microsoft-dataverse#latest-version-availability), which might have components that the target environment with an earlier (lower) Dataverse version doesn't have. Consequently, the solution might depend on components available in the source environment but absent in the target environment, leading to missing dependencies.

This issue can occur when you export a solution from an environment located in a region and import it into another region (which likely has an earlier Dataverse version.) For more information about the scenarios, see [Example](#example).

This warning ensures that you understand the drawbacks of having a source environment with a later version of Dataverse compared to the target environment.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, choose an environment for development in stations that have the same deployment schedule as the source environment. If the source environment is at a lower station, there is a possibility of taking dependencies on components that are released to the source environment but not to the target environment yet. Always consider changing your source environment to be in a region within a deployment station that's higher or equal to the target environment. This ensures that the target environment has components that are present in the source environment.

> [!NOTE]
> The warning doesn't confirm missing dependencies during solution import due to dependencies on components present in the source environment. Instead, this warning serves as a best practice guideline to properly configure source and target environments, reducing the risk of future missing dependencies.

The [Dataverse version](/dynamics365/released-versions/microsoft-dataverse#latest-version-availability) can be determined based on the region where the environment is present.

## Example

The following examples illustrate scenarios with different Dataverse versions in source and target environments:

Example 1:

| Environment | Region | Station |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Source| Canada| Station 2|
| Target| North America| Station 5|

In this scenario, the source environment is at a lower station than the target environment, potentially leading to a higher Dataverse version in the source environment. This can result in dependencies on components that are not yet available in the target environment, causing missing dependencies upon import. To avoid this, ensure the source environment has the same or higher version than the target environment.

 Example 2:

| Environment | Region | Station |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Source| North America| Station 5|
| Target| India| Station 2|

In this scenario, the source environment is at a higher station than the target environment. This ensures the source environment has the same or lower version than the target environment. The target environment always has components present in the source environment, and doesn't result in missing dependencies due to the source environment having a higher Dataverse version.

For more information about the environment deployment schedule for each region, see [Deployment schedule](/power-platform/admin/general-availability-deployment#deployment-schedule).
