# Troubleshoot Power Apps canvas app performance issues

> [!TIP]
> For performance issues, you can use profiling tools like [Monitor](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) and [Performance insights](/power-apps/maker/common/performance-insights-overview) to debug and diagnose problems.

The following table outlines common performance issues you might encounter while using a canvas app, along with likely causes and recommendations. High-level issues are linked to more detailed documentation through their associated causes and recommendations. Some recommendations might appear multiple times, as the root cause can manifest in various symptoms.

| Problem/Symptom   | Likely cause  | Recommendations |
| ---|---|---|
| Slow app/page load times | - Overloaded OnStart<br> - Large data sets<br> - Many cross-screen references <br> - Heavy media files    | - [Move calculations out of OnStart](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-large-apps#use-appformulas-instead-of-apponstart) <br> - [Use small data payloads](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads) <br>  - [Defer loading data](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/efficient-calculations#defer-significant-updates-to-a-nonblocking-ui-step) <br> - [Optimize resource usage â€“ media, controls, references](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/fast-app-page-load#minimize-required-resources)  |
| Large data payloads    | - Retrieving unnecessary data<br> - Large data sets <br>    |- [Use small data payloads](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads)<br>- [Use delegation](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads#use-delegation) <br> - [Prefilter data at the source](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/optimized-query-data-patterns#use-server-side-views) <br> - [Limit data retrieval](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads#suggestions) |
| Inefficient data queries | - Nondelegable queries<br> - Complex data operations <br>    |- [Use delegation](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads#use-delegation) <br> - [Optimize query patterns](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/optimized-query-data-patterns) |
| Inefficient calculations | - Complex formulas<br> - Repeated calculations <br>    |- [Optimize formulas](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/efficient-calculations#calculations) <br> - [Split up long formulas](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-large-apps#split-up-long-formulas)|
| Overall slow app performance | - Inefficient data retrieval<br> - Many cross-screen references<br> - Complex formulas<br>  - Overly large apps | - [Optimize data sources](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/optimized-query-data-patterns) <br> - [Optimize formulas](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/efficient-calculations#calculations) <br> - [Use collections for small, frequently used data](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/fast-app-page-load#avoid-directly-populating-a-collection-with-large-amounts-of-data) <br> - [Split up apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-large-apps#partition-the-app) |
