# Refresh URL isn't displayed for custom connectors when using Generic Oauth 2

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Platform, Custom Connectors

## Symptoms

When you try to verify the configuration of custom connectors that use **Generic Oauth 2** as the identity provider, you experience the following issues:

- The **Security** page shows placeholder text instead of the configured value in the **Refresh URL** field.

- In the Swagger Editor, the **Refresh URL** value isn't listed or displayed as a security definition.

## Cause

These issues are by design. After a custom connector is created, the configured **Refresh URL** value isn't displayed on either the **Security** page or in the Swagger Editor even though the other fields are populated as expected.

## Workaround

To update the **Refresh URL** value of a custom connector, you can set the value on the **Security** page, and select **Update connector**. Then, the value will be updated and saved to the connector configuration even though the configured value isn't displayed. For more information, see the [OAuth 2.0](/connectors/custom-connectors/connection-parameters#oauth-20) authentication type.
