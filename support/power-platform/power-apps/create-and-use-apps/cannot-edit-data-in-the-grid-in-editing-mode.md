# Can't edit data in the grid after enabling editing mode in a model-driven app

This article provides troubleshooting steps for different scenarios where you can't edit data in the grid after [enabling editing mode](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/the-power-apps-grid-control#configure-the-power-apps-grid-control) in a model-driven app in Microsoft Power Apps.

## Scenario 1: The entire grid control isn't editable even though editing mode is enabled

### Troubleshooting step

The first step is to check the grid and column parameters using the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview).

Make sure the grid editable mode is set to `yes`. If not, check the grid configuration and make sure the last configuration is saved and published. Also note that the form might also forcibly set sub-grids to read-only or disabled modes in certain cases (for example, when the currently edited record is deactivated). You can troubleshoot this issue by checking the `isControlDisabled` attribute.

## Scenario 2: Only certain cells from certain columns aren't editable

### Troubleshooting step

Use the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to check the attributes of the column that isn't editable (see the first screenshot in this article). If the `IsEditable` attribute is set to `false`, then editing isn't allowed here. Possible reasons include but aren't limited to:

- Dataverse doesn't support editing of the underlying column type. For example, calculated type columns aren't editable.
- The user might not have permission to edit that column.
- A [custom script](grid-issues.md#steps-to-perform-before-starting-troubleshooting) alters the cell attribute, making it permanently or conditionally read-only.
