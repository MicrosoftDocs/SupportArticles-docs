# Can't use column filters on a grid or subgrid or filtering doesn't work correctly in a model-driven app

This article provides troubleshooting steps for different scenarios where you can't use column filters on a grid or subgrid, or filtering doesn't work correctly in a Power Apps model-driven app.

## Scenario 1: Column filtering isn't enabled on any of the columns

### Troubleshooting step

Make sure the `enableFiltering` grid property is set to `true`. If it's set to `false`, check the grid control configuration to make sure the respective **Enable Filtering** property is enabled.

## Scenario 2: Column filtering options are missing or disabled on certain columns

### Troubleshooting step

After checking to ensure there's no [custom code](grid-issues.md#steps-to-perform-before-starting-troubleshooting) that affects filtering, use the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to check the column type.

> [!NOTE]
> Dataverse doesn't support filtering on certain columns. For more information about searchable columns, see [Types of columns](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/types-of-fields). Here's an example of a property type that doesn't support filtering:

## Scenario 3: Column filtering is enabled but not applied correctly

### Troubleshooting step

The most common cause is that extra filters are applied to the current view. Use the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to inspect the fetchXML query (see Image 6) and check all the filters that are shown in the query.

Additionally, other filters can be found in:

- [A quick find search](/power-apps/user/quick-find).
- A jump bar filter.

- Relationships with the parent entity.

- An entity specific filter (for example, a queue or an activity).

- A grid-related filter.

  You can use the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to inspect grid-related filters (see the following screenshots) and compare them with the final fetchXML query.

  In the following screenshots, a grid column filter with a name like `%Coffee%` or a name containing `Coffee` is used.
