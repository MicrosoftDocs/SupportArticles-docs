# Filter expression returns extra blank records in results

## Symptoms

Filter results sometimes have extra, unexpected, blank records in the result.

## Cause

Client-side filtering can result in blank records in the result when the **Formula-level error management** app setting is turned on. When a filter expression results in an unhandled error, blank records may be inserted in the result.

## Resolution

Use a formula pattern as follows:

```powerapps-dot
Filter(datasource, IfError(<query predicate>, false))
```
