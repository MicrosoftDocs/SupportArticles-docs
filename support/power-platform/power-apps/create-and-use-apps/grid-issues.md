## Steps to perform before starting troubleshooting

1. Remove or disable custom scripts. One of the first steps is to ensure that custom scripts don't interfere with product functionality. It's highly recommended to perform this step even when custom scripts are used to work in one of the previous versions.

    - If all custom scripts are attached via form events, follow the steps in [Troubleshoot form issues in model-driven apps](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/troubleshoot-forms) to disable them.
    - Other custom scripts are added directly via web resources, custom solutions, or plugins.
    - If the issue can't be reproduced after removing custom scripts, investigate all the customizations to find the problem.
    - If custom scripts are correctly using publicly documented APIs and the product doesn't behave as expected, try to simplify the custom script to localize the problem. In most of the cases, 10-30 lines of script code are enough to reproduce an issue.

2. If the problem involves custom entities, custom relationships, custom views, custom configurations, or other custom resources, try to reproduce the issue with out-of-the-box (OOB) standard resources and avoid any custom resources. This method helps localize the problem.

3. Disable all the applicable business rules to see if the issue is caused by a business rule.

4. If reproducing the issue involves the use of third-party tools, try to reproduce the issue with standard OOB tools.
