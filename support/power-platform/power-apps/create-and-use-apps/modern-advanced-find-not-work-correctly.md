# Modern Advanced Find doesn't work correctly in a model-driven app

This article provides troubleshooting steps for issues where the [Modern Advanced Find](/power-apps/user/advanced-find) feature doesn't work correctly in a model-driven app in Microsoft Power Apps.

## Scenario 1: Some filter conditions reappear after being deleted

### Troubleshooting step

Check if the automatically reapplied filters are related to the page filters. Some entities (activities and queues) support the page filters (see the following screenshot). Those filters can't be removed from the **Modern Advanced Find** window.

## Scenario 2: Some filter conditions aren't rendered correctly

### Troubleshooting step

[Modern Advanced Find](/power-apps/user/advanced-find) currently doesn't support the following conditions:

- The `Date` type fields used with standard operators. The `Date` type fields must be used with field-specific operators. For example, `on` should be `eq`, and `on-or-before` should be `lt`.
- The `in` type conditions. To ensure compatibility with Modern Advanced Find, the `in` type conditions should be replaced with several `eq`. For example,  `[city in "Redmond", "Washington" ]` should be replaced with `[city eq "Redmond" Or city eq "Washington"]`.

## Scenario 3: Unexpected data after applying Modern Advanced Find filters

### Troubleshooting step

1. Use the [Power Apps Monitor tool](/power-apps/maker/monitor-overview) to obtain the [fetchXML](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/use-fetchxml-construct-query) query and the `recordsCount` attribute.

1. Check all the filters in the fetchXML query and make sure they're all expected.

   If the fetchXML query contains extra filters, check for any extra filters that might be applied. For more information, see [Scenario 3: Column filtering is enabled but not applied correctly](cannot-use-column-filters-on-grid-subgrid-or-filtering-not-work-correctly.md#scenario-3-column-filtering-is-enabled-but-not-applied-correctly).
