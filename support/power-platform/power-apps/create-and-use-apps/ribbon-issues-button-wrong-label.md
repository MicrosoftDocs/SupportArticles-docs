# A button on the command bar has wrong labels or translations

This article resolves the wrong label or translation issue with a modern or classic command button in Microsoft Power Apps.

## Modern commands

You can customize labels and create translations for [modern commands](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/use-command-designer) the same way as for forms and tables. If a modern command shows incorrect text, its label might not have been configured correctly.

#### Check if correct translations are present in the solution

[Export translations](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/translate-localizable-text) for the [solution that contains the modern command](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/manage-commands-in-solutions). Open the XML file and verify that the label has the correct translations.

The following screenshot shows a translation file opened in Microsoft Excel. The last three rows are for a modern command's description, tooltip, and label. The last two columns show the text used for [LCIDs](/power-platform/admin/language-collations#language-and-associated-collation-used-with-dataverse) 1033 and 2052, corresponding to English (United States) and Simplified Chinese (China), respectively.

#### Check solution layering

If the correct text is present in the translation file, there might be other solutions that override it. [View the solution layers for the label](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/solution-layers#view-the-solution-layers-for-a-component) to check if there's text defined for the same label in a higher solution.

## Classic commands

You can [customize labels and create translations for classic commands](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/use-localized-labels-ribbons) by adding them to the `<RibbonDiffXml>` element of a *customization.xml* file and [importing the XML file into a solution](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/export-prepare-edit-import-ribbon).

#### Check if correct translations are present

1. [Enable Command checker and select the command button to inspect](ribbon-issues.md#use-command-checker).
1. The right pane shows four kinds of text that can be customized for a command button.

    - **Alt**: The label used by screen readers.
    - **LabelText**: The label displayed for the command button.
    - **ToolTipTitle**: The tooltip heading of the command button.
    - **ToolTipDescription**: The tooltip body text of the command button.

    For button label issues, the relevant property is **LabelText**.

1. At the bottom of the text property, select **View label solution layers**. This option won't appear if the text hasn't been customized.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some label customizations for system commands don't use `<RibbonDiffXml>` and hence can't be inspected in Command checker.

1. Solutions that have customized the text are listed. In this example, only one solution has a customized **LabelText**.

1. Select the solution to see all the [LocLabel](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/use-localized-labels-ribbons#using-localized-labels) translations it contains. Verify that the correct text is present.

#### Check solution layering

If the correct LocLabel is present in a solution, there might be other solutions that override it. [View label solution layers](#check-if-correct-translations-are-present) and check if a higher solution has defined the same LocLabel.

#### Check if label IDs match exactly in the letter casing

Label IDs are case-sensitive when matching IDs in the ribbon XML to localized label values. The button's **LabelText** should contain a valid LocLabel reference that exactly matches the casing of the ID of a LocLabel record.
