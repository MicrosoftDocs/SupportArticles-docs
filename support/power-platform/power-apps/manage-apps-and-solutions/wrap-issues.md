# Troubleshoot issues with the wrap feature in Power Apps

This article helps you resolve the most common issues with **wrap** feature in Microsoft Power Apps.

## Issue 1 - Wrap build is failing

If your wrap build fails, you can take the following steps to solve the issue.

#### Step 1: Verify that your images are in a PNG format

Ensure that the images you're using in wrap are in a PNG format. Using images in any format other than PNG in wrap will cause the build to fail. Use an image converter to save your images as .png files or ensure that your original image files are in a PNG format instead.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Manually changing your image file extension from .jpeg or any other format to .png will not automatically reformat the image to a PNG format.

#### Step 2: Verify that your App Center is correctly configured

Your App Center link must be created as an app within an organization and not a standalone app. The following screenshot shows how to create a new organization.

Check that the access token you've created is correct.

- The correct way to check the access token: Select the app you created, and then select **Settings** > **App API Tokens**.
- The incorrect way to check the access token: **Account Settings** > **User API Tokens**.

Verify that the iOS or Android app you created has the right configurations.

- iOS: OS = Custom
- Android: OS = Android, Platform = React Native

For more information, see steps 8 and 9 in [Create an App Center container for your mobile app](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#create-an-app-center-container-for-your-mobile-app).

#### Step 3: Verify that your key vault configuration is correct

Make sure that Azure Service Principal was created and the role was added correctly. For more information, see steps 1 and 2 in [Set up KeyVault for automated signing](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#set-up-keyvault-for-automated-signing).

Ensure that your key vault contains all necessary certificates, secrets, and tags for iOS and/or Android:

- iOS: two tags, one certificate, and one secret
- Android: one tag and one certificate

For more information, see [Set up KeyVault for automated signing](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#set-up-keyvault-for-automated-signing).

#### Step 4: Try again if you have all the proper configurations

If your wrap build still fails after you've verified that your wrap project has all the proper configurations, reach out to <pamobsup@microsoft.com>. For details, see the [Other issues in wrap](#other-issues-in-wrap) section of this article.

## Issue 2 - Wrap button is disabled for my app

You can only wrap apps you have edit permissions for. Make sure you have edit permissions for the app you want to wrap and try again.

## Issue 3 - Can't save my project or trigger a wrap build

To resolve this issue, you can:

- Update to the latest wrap solution version and try again.
- Ensure that no UI validation errors block the Save or Build submission.

## Issue 4 - Can't install a wrapped mobile app on a device

Make sure that you've signed the outputted application. You can sign it by configuring a key vault and providing it at build trigger time or manually signing. For more information on code signing, see:

- [Setup Keyvault for Automated Signing](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#set-up-keyvault-for-automated-signing)
- [Code sign for iOS](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/code-sign-ios)
- [Code sign for Android](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/code-sign-android)

Verify that your mobile device meets these [minimum requirements](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/overview#software-and-device-requirements).

## Issue 5 - Can't sign in to a wrapped mobile app or can't see data

If you can't sign in to your wrapped mobile app, verify that:

- Your Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD) app is properly configured.
- All API permissions for the app have been added correctly. For more information on how to see and configure API permissions for the app, see the below screenshot and [Configure API Permissions](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#configure-api-permissions).

  :::image type="content" source="media/wrap-issues/api-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of API permissions for the app." lightbox="media/wrap-issues/api-permissions.png":::

- The `Add-AdminAllowedThirdPartyApps` script was run successfully. For more information, see [Allow registered apps in your environment](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#allow-registered-apps-in-your-environment).
- Your AAD app type is Multi-tenant. Under your AAD app's **Authentication** tab, supported account types should be **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory â€“ Multitenant)**.
- The proper Redirect URIs have been created for iOS and Android. For Android, check that the hash is provided correctly. For more information on Redirect URIs, see [these steps](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to#redirect-uri-format).

## Other issues in wrap

For all other issues, or if your issue persists after following these steps, reach out to <pamobsup@microsoft.com>. You need to provide a repro video and/or screenshots together with a session ID that can be acquired in the following ways:

- On the sign-in screen, go to the lower right to select the gear icon, and then select **Session Details**.
- In an opened app, shake your device, and then select **Session Details**.
