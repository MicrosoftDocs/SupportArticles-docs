# Troubleshoot issues with the wrap feature in Power Apps

This article helps you resolve the most common issues with the wrap feature in Microsoft Power Apps.

## Issue 1 - Wrap build is failing

If your wrap build fails, you can take the following steps to solve the issue.

#### Step 1: Verify that your images are in PNG format

Ensure that the images you use in wrap are in PNG format. Using images in any format other than PNG in wrap will cause the build to fail. Use an image converter to save your images as *.png* files, or ensure that your original image files are in PNG format.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Manually changing your image file extension from *.jpeg* or any other format to *.png* won't automatically reformat the image to PNG format.

#### Step 2: Verify that your App Center is correctly configured

Your App Center link must be created as an app within an organization and not as a standalone app. The following screenshot shows how to create a new organization in wrap wizard.

For more information about how to automatically create a new location in wrap wizard, see [Step 5: Manage output](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/wrap-how-to#step-5-manage-output) in the "Create native mobile apps for iOS and Android using the wizard" section.

#### Step 3: Verify that your key vault configuration is correct

Make sure that an Azure service principal is created, and the service principal role is added correctly. For more information, see steps 1 and 2 in [Create native mobile apps for iOS and Android using the wizard](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/wrap-how-to#create-native-mobile-apps-for-ios-and-android-using-the-wizard).

Ensure that your key vault contains all necessary certificates, secrets, and tags for iOS, Android, or both:

- iOS: two tags, one certificate, and one secret
- Android: one tag and one certificate

For more information, see [Create Azure key vault for wrap in Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/create-key-vault-for-code-signing).

#### Step 4: Try again if you have all the proper configurations

If your wrap build still fails after you've verified that your wrap project has all the proper configurations, reach out to <pamobsup@microsoft.com>. For details, see the [Other issues in wrap](#other-issues-in-wrap-for-power-apps) section of this article.

## Issue 2 - Wrap button is disabled for my app

You can only wrap apps with edit permissions. Make sure that you have edit permissions to the app you want to wrap, and try again.

## Issue 3 - Can't save my project or trigger a wrap build

To resolve this issue, you can:

- Update to the latest wrap solution version and try again.
- Ensure that no UI validation errors block the **Save** or **Build** submission.

## Issue 4 - Can't install a wrapped mobile app on a device

Make sure that you've signed the outputted application. You can sign it by configuring a key vault and providing it at build trigger time, or manually signing. For more information on code signing, see:

- [Set up Key vault for automated signing](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/wrap-how-to#step-2-target-platform)
- [Code sign for iOS](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/code-sign-ios)
- [Code sign for Android](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/code-sign-android)

Verify that your mobile device meets these [minimum requirements](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/overview#software-and-device-requirements).

## Issue 5 - Can't sign in to a wrapped mobile app or can't see data

If you can't sign in to your wrapped mobile app, verify that:

- Your Microsoft Entra app is properly configured.
- All API permissions for the app have been added correctly. For more information about how to see and configure API permissions for the app, see the following screenshot and [Configure API Permissions](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/wrap-how-to#step-4-register-app).

  :::image type="content" source="media/wrap-issues/api-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the API permissions for the app." lightbox="media/wrap-issues/api-permissions.png":::

- The `Add-AdminAllowedThirdPartyApps` script has run successfully. For more information, see [Allow registered apps in your environment](/power-apps/maker/common/wrap/how-to).
- Your Microsoft Entra app type is **Multitenant**. Under your Microsoft Entra app's **Authentication** tab, the supported account type should be **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra directory - Multitenant)**.
- The proper redirect URIs have been created for iOS and Android. For Android, confirm that the hash is provided correctly. For more information about configuring a redirect URI, see [Configure platform settings](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#configure-platform-settings).
