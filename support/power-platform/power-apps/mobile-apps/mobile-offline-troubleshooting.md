# Troubleshoot offline sync errors in the Power Apps mobile app

Data sync can fail in [offline-enabled mobile apps](/power-apps/mobile/mobile-offline-overview) due to various errors. Depending on the type of the app, the error message may vary.

## Model-driven apps, including Field Service

If the offline sync status icon indicates a warning or error, you can tap on it to open the **Device Status** page to see more details. On the **Device Status** page, you can see your current device state and details of the last sync. If an error or warning occurs, you'll see a message describing the issue.

For more information, see [View offline sync status](/power-apps/mobile/offline-sync-icon).

## Canvas apps (preview)

In canvas apps, sync errors might occur when opening the app for the first time. A dialog appears with an error message. For more information, see [Work with canvas apps offline (preview)](/power-apps/mobile/canvas-mobile-offline-working).
