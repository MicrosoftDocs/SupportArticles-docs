## Verifying issue

This error occurs if your UI flows have the property **Use coordinates** set to **true** and UI flows can't locate the element using coordinates and the display resolution and scale on your playback machine doesn't match the scale and resolution of the machine on which the UI flows were recorded. The issue can be verified by following these steps:

1. Select and expand the Launch \<Application Name> step in your UI flow.
1. Select the **Show more** link.

## Solving steps

1. If your UI flows have the property **Use coordinates** set to **true**, it's required that the screen resolution & scale while recording should be the same as the screen resolution & scale during playback.
2. Keep the app maximized while recording to get an optimum performance.
