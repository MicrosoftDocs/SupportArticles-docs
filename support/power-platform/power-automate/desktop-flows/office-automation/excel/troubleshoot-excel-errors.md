# Errors when running desktop flows, including Excel actions

This article provides mitigation steps for errors generated by [Excel actions](/power-automate/desktop-flows/actions-reference/excel) in desktop flows. Most errors occur in the context of multiple Excel actions, and there's no strict mapping between them.

## Troubleshooting generic COMException (HRESULT: 0x800xxxxx) errors

When you try to open a blank or existing Excel file in Power Automate for desktop, you might receive an error similar to:

> System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: Exception from HRESULT: 0x800xxxxx

### Cause

This error might occur due to one or more of the following reasons:

- Office apps (or just Excel) aren't properly installed.
- Power Automate for desktop isn't properly installed.
- The Excel file is synchronized with OneDrive.

### Resolution

- Manually [uninstall](/power-automate/desktop-flows/install#uninstall-power-automate) and [reinstall](/power-automate/desktop-flows/install) Power Automate for desktop. If it doesn't work, ensure you have Excel properly installed.
- To work around the error caused by the synchronization with OneDrive, see [Using Excel files synchronized through OneDrive or SharePoint](/power-automate/desktop-flows/actions-reference/excel#using-excel-files-synchronized-through-onedrive-or-sharepoint).
