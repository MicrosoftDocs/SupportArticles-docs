|Win10AlreadyHasActiveSession|400|Unattended|Windows 10 only. You need to sign out from the active session on the machine.|
|UIFlowAgentNotAvailable|400|Attended</br>Unattended|You need to confirm that the service uiflowservice is up and running on your machine. If you have the following error when trying to start uiflowservice, see [Desktop flows failure](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4564550/):</br>**Windows could not start the UIFlowService service on Local Computer. Error 1069: The service did not start due to a logon failure**|
|UnableToCallCrlEndpoint|400|Attended</br>Unattended|You need to ensure the revocation list for the certificates can be checked. Ensure that the CRL services aren't blocked on the target machine. The services that must be contacted are listed in this article: [Limits for automated, scheduled, and instant flows](/power-automate/limits-and-config#ui-flows-required-services)|
|NoListenerConnected|404|Attended</br>Unattended|The endpoint wasn't found. There are no listeners connected to the endpoint.</br> Check that your machine is online.|
|ConnectionNotEstablished|404|Attended</br>Unattended|The endpoint wasn't found. None of the connected listeners accepted the connection within the allowed timeout.</br> This error code can be caused by routing or firewall configuration issues. Check that your machine is online and can communicate with the required Power Automate endpoints.|
|DnsError|404|Attended</br>Unattended|The endpoint wasn't found.</br> Register your machine again and schedule new runs.|
|ConnectionTimeout|404|Attended</br>Unattended|This request operation didn't receive a reply within the configured timeout.</br> Check that your machine is online and can communicate with the required Power Automate endpoints.|

|GroupIsEmpty|400|Attended</br>Unattended|The machine group is empty.</br> Add machines to the group, then reschedule new runs.|
|MSEntraMachineAlwaysPromptingForPassword|400|Unattended|For more information about this error code, see [An unattended desktop flow run fails with the MSEntraMachineAlwaysPromptingForPassword error](msentramachinealwayspromptingforpassword-error.md).|
|NoCandidateMachine|400|Attended</br>Unattended|The run has exceeded the queue waiting time limit.</br> Consider allocating more machines or spreading desktop flow runs to optimize wait time in the queue.|
|DesktopFlowsActionThrottled|429|Attended</br>Unattended|The desktop flow action failed because of throttling. This error code appears when too many desktop flows use the same connection. Check your connection usage and assign your desktop flows to multiple connections.|
|DesktopFlowsActionTimeout|400|Attended</br>Unattended|The execution of the desktop flow action exceeded maximum duration.</br> Increase the time-out value that's set on the action or split the desktop flow into several shorter desktop flows.|
|OnPremiseDataGatewayNotAvailable|502|Attended</br>Unattended|This error code only occurs when using an on-premises data gateway (deprecated) to connect to the machine. Check that the targeted machine and the data gateway on that machine are up and running.|
|AuthTokenNotYetValid|401|Attended</br>Unattended|This can happen if the group password is created from a machine that has a clock indicating a time in the future for the machine that sent that error. Ensure that all machines have an up-to-date clock and retry in a few minutes.|
|UIFlowAgentLauncherServiceIsNotRunning|500|Attended</br>Unattended|A required service is not running on the target machine. Ensure that the **Power Automate agent launcher service** is running on the target machine.|
|TotalChunksMismatch|400|Attended</br>Unattended|When sending the required data to run the desktop flow, a corruption was detected. </br>- Ensure that there is enough free disk space on the target machine to run the automation. </br>- Ensure that the network connection is stable during the automation. </br>- Consider reducing the size of the script to reduce the risk of a chunks mismatch error. </br>- If the issue occurs consistently for every run，and you're running Power Automate version 2.36 or later, check if the cache folder _C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\UIFlowService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Power Automate Desktop\Cache_ exists. If it does, stop the runs from executing, and then delete the cache folder with administrator permissions.|
|DesktopFlowMalformedMachineResponse|500|Attended</br>Unattended|This error code occurs when the target machine provides an unexpected response to the cloud orchestrator. </br>- Verify that the machine has sufficient compute and memory resources while running the automation.</br>- Ensure that the network connection is stable during the automation. </br>- Ensure that you have the latest version of Power Automate for desktop installed.|
|WcfServerCrash|500|Attended</br>Unattended|This error code occurs when the machine encounters an unexpected error while answering the cloud orchestrator. </br>- Verify that the machine has sufficient compute and memory resources while running the automation.</br>- Ensure that the network connection is stable during the automation. </br>- Ensure that you have the latest version of Power Automate for desktop installed.|
|DataverseTimeout|504|Attended</br>Unattended|A desktop flow has been triggered and then failed due to a time-out of a Dataverse call. Take the following steps to solve this issue:</br>1. Scale up your Dataverse instance. Contact your administrator for assistance with this step.</br>2. Identify the heavily used Dataverse instance. The Dataverse call might be affected by other users using the same Dataverse instance in parallel.</br>3. Contact Microsoft Support for further assistance if this issue persists in your environment.|
|RdpPermissionNotGranted|400|Unattended|This error occurs when the user specified in the connection doesn't have permissions to create remote desktop sessions on the machine. </br>- Verify that the user in question is included in either the Administrators or Remote Desktop Users group on the machine.</br>- Verify that there are no deny policies interfering. Go to start > **Run**, and type _secpol.msc_ to open the Local Security Policy console. Then, navigate to **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **User Rights Assignment**. Ensure that both the **Deny log on locally** and **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** settings don't include the account running the Power Automate service (UIFlowService). To find out which account this is, see the [troubleshoot experience](/power-automate/desktop-flows/troubleshoot#change-the-on-premises-service-account) in the runtime application.|
|XrmMachineGroupNotFound|404|Attended</br>Unattended|This error occurs when the machine group has been deleted. Re-create the group and update the connection.|
|SessionCreationInvalidCredentials|400|Unattended|This error occurs when the unattended session couldn't be created with the provided credentials. This issue might occur due to an incorrectly formatted username. For Microsoft Entra joined machines, ensure the username is in the `user@domain.com` format. For domain-joined machines, the username should be in the `domain\user` format.|
|UIFlowServiceNoRdpPermissions|400|Unattended|This error occurs when the Power Automate service ([UIFlowService](/power-automate/desktop-flows/troubleshoot#change-the-on-premises-service-account)) running on your computer can't list the Windows sessions on the machine. </br> Add the user account that the service runs as (usually **NT SERVICE\UIFlowService**) to the "Remote Desktop Users" group on your machine.|
|AccountLockedOut|400|Unattended|This error occurs when an internal system policy has prevented an account from creating a session on the machine because of too many sign-in attempts or password change attempts for the account. It's related to an on-premises configuration, not Power Automate licenses. Check that password rotation policies don't interfere with your scheduled runs, causing many incorrect sign-in attempts. If this error occurs regularly, work with your IT administrator to review sign-in attempt logs and account lockout policies.|
|LogonTypeNotGranted|400|Unattended|For more information, see [troubleshooting documentation for logon type not granted](logon-type-has-not-been-granted.md).|
|UnallowedTenantForConnectWithSignIn|403|Attended|This error occurs when using a [connect with sign-in](/power-automate/desktop-flows/desktop-flow-connections#connect-with-sign-in-for-attended-runs) connection on an Active Directory (AD) domain-joined machine without adding your tenant to the allowlist. </br> For more information, see ["UnallowedTenantForConnectWithSignIn" error in a Power Automate desktop flow](troubleshoot-unallowed-tenant-for-connect-with-sign-in.md).|
|MachineNotFound|404|Attended</br>Unattended|This error can occur when the machine is unregistered during a run or if the Dataverse organization has been migrated to a different region. Verify that:</br>- Your machine is still registered by [viewing its status](/power-automate/desktop-flows/manage-machines#view-list-of-machines) in the machine runtime application or the Power Automate portal.</br>- Your [desktop flow connection](/power-automate/desktop-flows/desktop-flow-connections) isn't broken in the Power Automate portal.</br>- [Scripting actions](/power-automate/desktop-flows/actions-reference/scripting) in your flow don't register your machine while the flow is running.|
