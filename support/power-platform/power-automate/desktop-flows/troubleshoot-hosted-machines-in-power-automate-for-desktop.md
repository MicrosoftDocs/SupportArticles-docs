### Flow run failures

- Network Level Authentication (NLA) not disabled

  You might see the following error details if an unattended flow run is triggered against a machine that's NLA-enabled:

  > Could not create unattended session with these credentials. Please make sure you have Network Level Authentication (NLA) disabled in your remote settings if you’re using Microsoft Entra credentials.

  To resolve the issue, disable Network Level Authentication (NLA) for unattended runs.

- Active session exists

  You might see the following error details when an unattended flow run is triggered against a machine with an active user session:

  > No machine able to run the desktop flow has been found. Aborting execution. Error encountered when connecting to machines: There is a user session on the target machine. Cannot execute unattended desktop flow.

  When "reuse session" is disabled, no active user session should be running on the target machine. To resolve this issue, open the Task Manager and go to the **Users** tab, terminate all other user sessions except for the current session, and then sign out from the machine.
