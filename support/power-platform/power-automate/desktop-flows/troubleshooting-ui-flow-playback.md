## Tips and tricks

Playback

- Don't use the keyboard and mouse during playback.
- Try to adjust your app has the same initial state as the recording time.
- Use the same keyboard and locale setting as recording time.
- If you're using coordinate offset fallback
  - Current coordinate-based fallback is conservative and ensures the control is the same as what was recorded, including the size.
  - Use the same resolution and scale setting as recording time.
  - Maximize the app size to minimize disruption.

Recording

- Ensure the same keyboard layouts you're using to record will be the same as for playback.
- Use shortcuts instead of selecting. For instance, copy paste with ctrl + c & ctrl + v instead of right-click copy.
- Use **enter static text** if you're working with strings for better readability.
- When you insert text into a field already have text inside, you should select ctrl+A and backspace to clear up the field first.
- Playback uses accessibility by default, it can fallback to coordinate as well if you turn it on.
  - Use a standard resolution, and scale setting that across your recording and playback devices.
  - Maximize the application window that you're recording.
  - Finish the recording in one monitor if possible.
