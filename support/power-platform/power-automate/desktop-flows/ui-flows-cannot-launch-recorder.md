## Verifying the issue

1. Check that you're using a compatible web browser:

    - Microsoft Edge (version 80 or later)
    - Google Chrome

2. Check that you've enabled the UI flows for Power Automate chromium extension:

    - In Microsoft Edge, navigate to `edge://extensions`
    - In Google Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`

    Verify that the extension is enabled in the extensions page:

    Enable the extension by toggling the switch on the card.

3. Verify that the UI flows service is running

    There should be an icon in the system tray:

    If the icon isn't present, you can manually start the service by searching for **UI flows** in the **start** menu:

4. Check that you've installed the UI flows package:

    - In Windows 10, navigate to **Settings** → **Apps & features**  
    - In Windows 8.1 or earlier, navigate to **Control Panel** → **Add or Remove Programs**

    Look for the UI flows installation package:

    If the package isn't installed, follow the instructions in the UI flows wizard to download and install the latest version.
