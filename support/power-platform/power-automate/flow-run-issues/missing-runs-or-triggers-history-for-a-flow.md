# Missing runs or triggers history for a flow

For a flow, sometimes users can't find trigger or run history in flow runs page or in activity center.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Automate  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4538672

Flow run or trigger history is retained for 28 days after the start of the flow. So, if it's past 28 days, the history is deleted and the data you're looking for won't be there.
