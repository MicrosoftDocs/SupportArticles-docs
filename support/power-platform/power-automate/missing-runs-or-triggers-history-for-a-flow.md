# Missing runs or triggers history for a flow

For a flow, sometimes users cannot find trigger or run history in flow runs page or in activity center.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Automate  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4538672

Flow run or trigger history is retained for 30 days after the start of the flow. So if it is past 30 days history is deleted and data you are looking for will not be there.
