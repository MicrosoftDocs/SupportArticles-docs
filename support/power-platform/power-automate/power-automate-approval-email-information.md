# Power Automate approval email delivery information

This article describes the information about Power Automate approval emails.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Power Automate  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4559558

## Overview

Approval emails are sent from outside of the organization boundary and routed to the email domain of the specified recipient. Which is to ensure that all organizational policies for inbound mail are respected.

For customers whose MX record points at another filtering service (for instance, Proofpoint or Mimecast), messages will be routed to those services first per MX routing priorities, and not directly to Office 365 or on-premises mailboxes.

## Commercial

For commercial Power Automate (all geos), approval emails may come from any IP in the following Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record.

> [!NOTE]
> SPF records can be updated when more servers and regions are added. For the most up-to-date IP address ranges, you can look up the SPF record for `_spf1-meo.microsoft.com`.
