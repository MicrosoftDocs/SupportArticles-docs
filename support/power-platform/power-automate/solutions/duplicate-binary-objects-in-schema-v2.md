# Duplicate binary objects in the v2 schema desktop flow solution

This article provides workarounds for issues related to desktop flows in the v2 schema when dealing with solutions and duplicate binaries.

## Symptoms

When you use [Power Automate v2 schema](/power-automate/desktop-flows/schema) with a managed or unmanaged solution and try to run your desktop flow [locally](/power-automate/desktop-flows/run-desktop-flows-url-shortcuts) or [through the cloud](/power-automate/desktop-flows/trigger-desktop-flows), you might receive the following error in the logs:

> DesktopFlowBinaryReferenceCollisionException

## Cause

This issue occurs due to the way Dataverse layering works. Assume you have desktop flows in two environments (achieved with solution export or import). If you update the same desktop flow in both environments, and then try to import one solution into the other environment, the process will run into errors.

This issue happens because new desktop flow binaries are created when you update the v1 schema to the v2 schema. Those binaries created in each environment have different IDs, and when importing the solution, Dataverse will see them as two separate binaries. Because only one binary of each type is expected, this will lead to duplicate binaries from the perspective of Power Automate for desktop.

## Workaround

Since this behavior is related to how the platform works, there isn't a specific version of Power Automate for desktop that will change the behavior. However, the issue isn't expected to persist after you apply one of the following workarounds.

### Workaround for a managed solution

1. Delete the solution in the target environment.
2. Reimport the solution into the environment as a managed solution.

### Workaround for an unmanaged solution

1. Delete the desktop flow in the target environment.
2. Reimport the solution into the environment as an unmanaged solution.

For more information, see [Application lifecycle management (ALM) for Power Automate v2 schema](/power-automate/desktop-flows/alm-schema).

## More information

The following table describes the possible cases when dealing with v1 and v2 schema desktop flows and solutions. It also provides more information on the v2 schema desktop flow behavior with managed and unmanaged solutions.

> [!NOTE]
> V2 schema desktop flows in a managed solution can't be edited in Power Automate for desktop. This is a behavior change compared to the v1 schema, where editing is allowed.
