## Cause

There are many reasons you may get this error when using an AAD account:

- The account credentials entered into the connection may not match those on the machine.
- The device may not be AAD joined (or hybrid AAD joined) to support AAD authentication.
- The AAD account may not be synchronized to the machine.

## Resolution

First, ensure that the device is AAD-joined or domain-joined:

1. Open a command prompt.
2. Run the command `dsregcmd /status`.
3. Check the Device State section.

Make sure that one of the `DomainJoined` or `AzureAdJoined` values is **YES**.

If it is not the case, an AAD account can't be used unless the device is joined, see the Microsoft documentation on [How to join a device](/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-join-device-on-network#to-join-an-already-configured-windows-10-device).

Second, identify the AAD account to use in the machine configuration:

1. Open **Settings** and select **Accounts**.
2. Select **Access work or school**.
3. Make sure you see text that says something like, Connected to <your_organization> Azure AD. The account by which it says it's connected can be used in the connection.

Third, synchronize the AAD account on the device. To do this:

1. Select the **Info** button when selecting your Azure AD connection in the **Access work or school** screen.
2. This will open a screen that describes your connection info and device sync status. There will be a button **Sync** at the end of this, select this button, and wait for this process to complete.

Fourth, check that the configured AAD account can log into the device:

1. Try to sign in to the machine using the AAD account identified in the step above.
2. The device login must be successful in order to be used in a connection.

Lastly, make sure the flow is configured properly with the right username and password. This much matches the account on your computer.
