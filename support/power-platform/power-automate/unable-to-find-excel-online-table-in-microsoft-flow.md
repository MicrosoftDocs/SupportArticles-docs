## Resolution

To create a table from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Select the cells you want to include in the table.
2. Select **Insert** > **Table** > **Ok**.

To convert existing data into a table, follow these steps:

1. Select the cells containing the data you want to convert into a table.
2. Select **Home** > **Format as Table**.
