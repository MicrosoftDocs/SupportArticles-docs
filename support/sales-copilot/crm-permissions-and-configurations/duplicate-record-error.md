## Cause

A duplicate detection rule in CRM is configured to prevent specific fields from having duplicate values across multiple records. When a user tries to create a record that contains a duplicate field from Copilot for Sales, the duplicate detection rule in CRM prevents the record from being created.

For example, if a duplicate detection rule is configured to prevent the creation of a record with the same email address as an existing record, the record creation fails if the new record's email address matches the existing record's email address.

## Resolution

To resolve the error, use either of the following methods:

- Create the record again with a different value for the field that caused the error. For example, if an error occurs because the new record's email address matches an existing record's email address, re-create the record with a different email address.
- Ask your administrator to modify the duplicate detection rule in CRM to allow duplicate values for the field that caused the error.
