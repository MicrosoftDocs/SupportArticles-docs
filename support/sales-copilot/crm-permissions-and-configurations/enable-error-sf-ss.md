## Symptoms

When you try to enable Salesforce with server-to-server flow, one of the following error messages is displayed.

- Couldn't find the connected app.
- Couldn't get user license ID is missing to create connection user.

- Couldn't complete the connected app deployment to Salesforce. Try again.
- Couldn't complete the permission set deployment to Salesforce. Try again.

## Cause

During Salesforce server-to-server flow setup, a connected app is deployed to the Salesforce organization. The connected app is associated with an integration user that is created automatically. A permission set is then assigned to the integration user. In this process, some unexpected errors may occur.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, try again. If the issue persists, gather the error details and contact Microsoft support.
