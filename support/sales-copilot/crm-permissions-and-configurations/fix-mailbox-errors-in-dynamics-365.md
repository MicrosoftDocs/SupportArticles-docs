## Cause

This issue occurs because one or more sync errors occur in server-side synchronization.

Copilot for Sales requires server-side synchronization to synchronize emails and meetings to Dynamics 365. When server-side synchronization encounters an error while attempting the synchronization, Copilot for Sales detects and displays this error message for you to take action and resolve the error.

## Resolution

To resolve the error, you must locate the specific error as part of the mailbox alert wall, read the description, and take action. You can also delete the error to suppress it.

1. Open the CRM instance you connected to Copilot for Sales.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To get the CRM instance URL, select **Options** (**…**) in the upper-right corner of the Copilot for Sales pane. The URL is displayed under **Signed in to Dynamics 365**.

2. Select **Settings** > **Personalization Settings**.
