## Cause

The user doesn't have the required security roles assigned.

To use Copilot for Sales, users must have a valid Dynamics 365 license and be assigned the appropriate security roles. These roles have the required permissions for Copilot for Sales to work properly.

## Resolution

The following security roles must be assigned to each user using Copilot for Sales:

- **Salesperson**
- **Basic User**
- **Sales Copilot User**

For information about how to assign security roles to users, see [Assign a security role to a user](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles).
