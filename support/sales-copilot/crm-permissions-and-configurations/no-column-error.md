# Salesforce CRM users unable to see data in Copilot for Sales

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve an issue where users can't see data in Microsoft Copilot for Sales.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Sales Copilot is rebranded as Microsoft Copilot for Sales in January 2024. The screenshots in this article will be updated with the new name soon.

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Client app**     |  Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in        |
|**Platform**     | Web and desktop clients         |
|**OS**     | Windows and Mac         |
|**Deployment**     | User managed and admin managed       |
|**CRM**     | Salesforce        |
|**Users**     | Users who don't have permission to view fields added in Copilot for Sales forms   |

## Symptoms

When a user opens Copilot for Sales in Outlook, the following error message is displayed:

> Something went wrong

:::image type="content" source="media/no-column-error/no-such-column-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the details of the Something went wrong error.":::

## Cause

The field-level security for the field is set to invisible in Salesforce CRM. As a result, Copilot for Sales can't reference that field as expected in the configuration.

## Resolution 1: Fix field-level security in Salesforce CRM

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator and open **Setup**.

2. Open **Object Manager**.

3. Select the entity that is throwing the error.

4. In the navigation bar on the left, select **Fields & Relationships**.

5. Select the field that is throwing the error.

6. Select **Set Field-Level Security** at the top.

7. Ensure that **Visible** is set for the right profiles.

8. Validate the same for custom permissions sets.

## Resolution 2: Change settings in Copilot for Sales to hide fields or remove edit capabilities

Change the admin settings from the Copilot for Sales admin settings in Microsoft Teams to hide the fields or remove editing capabilities.

1. Sign in to Microsoft Teams with your administrator credentials.

2. In the navigation bar on the left, select **Copilot for Sales**.

3. On the **Settings** tab, select **Forms**.

4. Select the entity for which you're seeing the error.

5. Under **Manage fields**, perform one of the following actions:

    - If the issue is related to editing a field, turn off **Allow editing** for the corresponding field.

        :::image type="content" source="media/no-column-error/turn-off-edit-fields.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to turn off editing for a few fields on the Manage fields page." lightbox="media/no-column-error/turn-off-edit-fields.png":::
    - If the issue is related to viewing a field, hover over the field, and select **Remove field** (:::image type="icon" source="media/no-column-error/delete-icon.png ":::).

6. Select **Publish** to save your changes.

## Resolution 3: Refresh the data from CRM

If you don't know which field is causing the issue, you can [refresh the data](/microsoft-sales-copilot/customize-forms-and-fields#refresh-data-from-crm) from CRM. This action will sync the latest changes from CRM to Copilot for Sales and remove any fields that were removed from CRM but are still available in Copilot for Sales. After you refresh the data, you must close and reopen the Copilot for Sales add-in in Outlook.
