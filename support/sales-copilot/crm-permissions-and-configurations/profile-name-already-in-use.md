# "The profile name is already in use. Pick a different name or rename the existing profile in Salesforce" error when enabling Salesforce server-to-server flow

This article helps you troubleshoot the error "The profile name is already in use. Pick a different name or rename the existing profile in Salesforce." when you enable Salesforce server-to-server flow.

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Client app**     |  Teams        |
|**Platform**     | Web and desktop clients         |
|**OS**     | Windows and Mac         |
|**Deployment**     | User managed and admin managed       |
|**CRM**     | Salesforce        |
|**Users**     | Administrator   |

## Symptoms

When you try to enable Salesforce with server-to-server flow, the following error message is displayed:

> The profile name is already in use.

## Cause

When a setup request is received, the server attempts to create a profile named **Copilot For Sales Integration Profile** for the Salesforce Server-to-Server flow. The error occurs when a profile with the same name already exists in the organization, preventing the creation process.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, check if a profile with the same name already exists in the Salesforce organization. If it was created before enabling the Server-to-Server flow, rename the existing profile and try again. If the profile was not created previously, contact Microsoft Support.
