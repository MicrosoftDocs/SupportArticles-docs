# Couldn't remove the connected app when disabling Salesforce server-to-server flow

This article helps you troubleshoot the "Couldn't remove the connected app. It may be read-only, missing, or restricted." error when you disable Salesforce Server-to-server flow.

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Client app**     |  Teams        |
|**Platform**     | Web and desktop clients         |
|**OS**     | Windows and Mac         |
|**Deployment**     | User managed and admin managed       |
|**CRM**     | Salesforce        |
|**Users**     | Administrator  |

## Symptoms

When you try to disable Salesforce with server-to-server flow, the following error message is displayed.

> Couldn't remove the connected app. It may be read-only, missing, or restricted.

## Cause

When a disable request is received, the server attempts to delete deployed resources, such as the connected app and permission set. The error occurs when the current user doesn't have the permissions to delete the connected app or the app is already deleted.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, perform the following actions:

- **Check permissions**: Ensure that the user signed in to the Teams admin settings has the necessary permissions to modify all data and manage connected apps. If the current user lacks these permissions, either assign the required permissions or switch to a user who has them.
- **Check connected app**: In Salesforce, go to **Setup** > **Apps** > **Connected Apps** > **Manage Connected Apps**. Confirm that the **Copilot for Sales Connected App** connected app exists.
