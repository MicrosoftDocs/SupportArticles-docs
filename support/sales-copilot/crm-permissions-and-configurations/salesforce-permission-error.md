# Salesforce CRM users can't view, edit, or save data in Copilot for Sales

This article helps you resolve an issue where users can't view, edit, or save data in Microsoft Copilot for Sales.

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Client app**     |  Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in        |
|**Platform**     | Web and desktop clients         |

:::image type="content" source="media/salesforce-permission-error/sf-perm-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the error that occurs when users don't have permission in CRM to view, create, or edit objects.":::

## Cause

The user has no permission to view, create, or edit objects in Salesforce CRM. As a result, Copilot for Sales can't reference that object as expected in the configuration.

Objects must have at least read permissions to be displayed in Copilot for Sales. For example, if a user doesn't have read permissions for the Contact entity, the contacts won't be displayed in Copilot for Sales.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, update the user profile permissions in Salesforce.

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator.
2. Go to **Setup** > **Administration** > **Users** > **Users**.
3. Find the user who is experiencing the issue and select the profile that's assigned to the user. Perform the following steps based on the profile type:

   - If the profile isn't a custom profile, change it to one that has the correct permissions. 
   - If the profile is correct and is a custom profile, select **Edit**. Then, in the **Standard Object Permissions** section, provide the required permissions.

4. Save the changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Updating permissions in a profile can affect other users who are assigned to the same profile. 
    > - Users must have permission to access all the objects that are added to Copilot for Sales from the admin settings in Microsoft Teams.
