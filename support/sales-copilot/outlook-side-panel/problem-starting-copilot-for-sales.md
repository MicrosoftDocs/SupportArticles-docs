When you copy the error details, the error name displayed is:

> Error occurred in the authentication request from Office.

## Cause 1: Pop-ups or cross-site tracking are blocked in the browser

When you open the Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in, an authentication pop-up window is opened to link the add-in to the current Outlook context. If pop-up or cross-site tracking are blocked in the browser, the add-in isn't authenticated and the error message is displayed.

### Resolution

You must allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking in the browser. Different browsers have different settings to allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking. We have provided the steps to allow pop-ups and cross-site tracking in the following browsers:

#### Microsoft Edge

You'll receive a notification in the address bar if pop-ups are blocked. Select the option to always allow pop-ups from the Office 365 website. After you allow pop-ups, refresh the page, and then open the Copilot for Sales add-in.

If the notification doesn't appear in the address bar, follow these steps:

1. Open browser settings.

1. In the left pane, select **Cookies and site permissions**.

1. In the right pane, select **Pop-ups and redirects**.
