## Cause

The **Access needed** error message is displayed because of one of the following reasons:

2. Go to **Settings** > **Advanced Settings**.
3. On the command bar, select **Settings** > **Security**.
4. Select **Users**, and then change the view to **Disabled users**.

    If the affected user is shown as disabled, enable the user.

## Resolution 2: Add the user as a member of the Microsoft Entra ID security group

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) with the System Administrator credentials.
1. In the left navigation pane, under **Admin centers**, select **Microsoft Entra ID**.

    The **Microsoft Entra admin center** opens.

1. In the left navigation pane, under **Identity**, select **Groups** > **All Groups**.
1. Find the security group to which the user needs to be assigned, and then select to open it.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Members**, and then select **Add members**.
