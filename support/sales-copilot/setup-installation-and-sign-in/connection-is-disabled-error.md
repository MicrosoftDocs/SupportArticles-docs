:::image type="content" source="media/connection-is-disabled-error/connection-disabled-error-from-token-exchange.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the disabled Salesforce connection error.":::

## Cause

The Salesforce connection is disabled in the [msdyn_viva environment](/microsoft-sales-copilot/data-handling#copilot-for-sales-dataverse-and-your-crm).

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is enabled in the tenant's msdyn_viva environment, thereby blocking the Salesforce connector. Therefore, existing connections to Salesforce have been disabled.

## Resolution

1. [Sign out of Copilot for Sales](/microsoft-sales-copilot/more-options#sign-out-of-copilot-for-sales) and close the Copilot for Sales pane.
1. Reopen the Copilot for Sales pane and sign in to Salesforce.

> [!NOTE]
> If the issue isn't resolved, see [Can't sign in to Salesforce due to blocked Salesforce connector](sign-in-issue-with-blocked-connector.md) to unblock the Salesforce connector in the DLP policy.
