## Cause 1: Bad OAuth token

The Salesforce connection, created using the Salesforce connector, maintains the authentication tokens for the connected user. The same authentication tokens are used to communicate with Salesforce. The bad OAuth token error occurs when the Salesforce connection is unable to renew the authentication tokens.

## Cause 2: Expired or invalid session

The Salesforce session has reached its expiration time, or the session has become invalid. This is based on the session configuration in Salesforce.

## Resolution

To solve this issue, perform one of these steps:

- Select **Sign in again** in the error message, and then sign in to Salesforce again.
- [Sign out of Copilot for Sales](/microsoft-sales-copilot/more-options#sign-out-of-copilot-for-sales) and then sign in to Salesforce again.
