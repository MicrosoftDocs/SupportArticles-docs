This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve authentication issues when connecting to Salesforce CRM from the [Microsoft Copilot for Sales add-in for Outlook](/microsoft-sales-copilot/use-sales-copilot-outlook).

## Who is affected?

## Symptoms

## Cause

Policies of the Microsoft Power Platform connected app block users from connecting to Salesforce CRM.

Copilot for Sales connects to Salesforce CRM through the Microsoft Power Platform connected app. To sign in to Salesforce CRM from Copilot for Sales, users must provide their consent to the Microsoft Power Platform app to contact Salesforce CRM on their behalf. When consent can't be provided, the sign-in process fails.

## Resolution

Copilot for Sales uses the Microsoft Power Platform connected app to connect to Salesforce CRM. Ensure that the policies of the Microsoft Power Platform app are configured to allow users to connect to Salesforce CRM.

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator.

2. Go to **Setup** > **Platform Tools** > **Apps** > **Connected Apps** > **Managed Connected Apps**.

3. On the **Connected Apps** page, select **Microsoft Power Platform**.

4. Select **Edit policies**.

5. Under **OAuth Policies**, select one of the following values for **Permitted Users**:

    1. **All users may self-authorize**: This option allows any authenticated Salesforce user to connect to the Salesforce instance through the Microsoft Power Platform connector used by Microsoft Copilot for Sales, Microsoft Power Automate, and potentially other apps to gain access to Salesforce, thus resolving the issue.

    1. **Admin approved users are pre-authorized**: This option enables administrators to explicitly grant permissions to individual users through **Profiles** and **Permission Sets**. For more information, see [Connected Apps](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_overview.htm&type=5) and [Manage Access to a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_manage.htm&type=5).

6. Select **Save**.
