## Cause

The Microsoft Power Platform app in Salesforce CRM is blocked by an administrator.

Copilot for Sales connects to Salesforce CRM through the Microsoft Power Platform connected app. When the Microsoft Power Platform app is blocked by an administrator, the Salesforce authentication process fails with the error message.

## Resolution

Ensure that the Microsoft Power Platform connected app isn't blocked in Salesforce CRM.

1. Sign in to Salesforce CRM as an administrator.
1. Go to **Setup** > **Platform Tools** > **Apps** > **Connected Apps** > **Connected Apps OAuth Usage**.
1. For the **Microsoft Power Platform** app, select **Unblock**.

    The **Microsoft Power Platform** app disappears from the list, but it's unblocked.

    After the first successful sign-in from the first user using Copilot for Sales, the **Microsoft Power Platform** app appears in the list again.
