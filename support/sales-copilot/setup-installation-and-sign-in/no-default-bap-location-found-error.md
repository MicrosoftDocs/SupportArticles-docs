# "No default BAP location found for this tenant" error in Copilot for Sales

This article helps you troubleshoot and resolve issues in Microsoft Copilot for Sales when users are unable to use Copilot for Sales due to missing a default environment.

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|----------------|--------------------|
| **Client App** | Microsoft Outlook only        |

## Symptoms

:::image type="content" source="media/no-default-bap-location-found-error/no-default-bap-location.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the No default BAP location found for this tenant error.":::

## Cause

No default environment is created in Power Apps.

Copilot for Sales requires a Power Apps environment for every organization. When Copilot for Sales is launched for the first time, it calls a Power Platform API to get the region details. If the organization doesn't have an existing Power Platform environment, an error message is displayed when attempting to get region details.

## Resolution

To resolve the issue, open the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). A default environment is created for the tenant.
