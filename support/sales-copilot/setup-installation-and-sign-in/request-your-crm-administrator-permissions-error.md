## Cause

The issue occurs when you don't have API permissions in Salesforce. You can confirm if this is the root cause of the issue if you see the following error in the logs:

```output
Exception thrown in VivaSalesContacts/GetContactsByEmailAddress - 
Microsoft.SalesProductivity.Common.Base.SPServiceException: Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: entity is deleted clientRequestId: {CLIENT REQUEST ID HERE}-self ---> 
System.Exception: { 
    "error": { 
        "code": 502, 
        "source": "{APIM SOURCE}", 
        "message": "BadGateway", 
        "innerError": { 
            "status": 502, 
            "message": "Salesforce failed to complete task: Message: **API is disabled for this User**\r\nclientRequestId: {CLIENT REQUEST ID HERE}", 
            "error": null, 
            "source": "Salesforce.Common", 
            "errors": [] 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

1. In the **Administrative Permissions** section, select **API Enabled**.
1. Select **Save**.
