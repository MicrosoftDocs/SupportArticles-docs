:::image type="content" source="media/sign-in-issue-with-blocked-connector/blocked-connector-error.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the error that occurs when the Salesforce connector is blocked.":::

## Cause

The Salesforce connector is blocked in the [msdyn_viva environment](/microsoft-sales-copilot/data-handling#copilot-for-sales-dataverse-and-your-crm).

The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy is enabled in the tenant's msdyn_viva environment, thereby blocking the Salesforce connector.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must unblock the Salesforce connector in the DLP policy.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) with admin credentials.
1. In the left navigation pane, select **Policies** > **Data policies**.
1. Select the data policy that blocks the Salesforce connector, and then select **Edit Policy**.
1. In the **Prebuilt connectors** step, move the **Salesforce** connector to either **Business** or **Non-business**.
1. Go through the rest of the steps, and then select **Update policy**.

For more information, see [Manage data loss prevention (DLP) policies](/power-platform/admin/prevent-data-loss).
