# "User does not have required privileges to access the org in Admin Only mode" error

This article provides a resolution for an error message that occurs in Microsoft Copilot for Sales when the organization is in [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode).

## Who is affected?

| Requirement type |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Client app**     |  Copilot for Sales Outlook add-in and Teams app    |
|**Platform**     | Web and desktop clients         |
|**OS**     | Windows and Mac         |
|**Deployment**     | User managed and admin managed       |
|**CRM**     | Dynamics 365      |
|**Users**     | Users trying to use Copilot for Sales when **Administration mode** is enabled. |

## Symptoms

When you use Copilot for Sales, you receive the "Something went wrong" error message with the following error description:

> User does not have required privileges (or role membership) to access the org when it is in Admin Only mode.

The error might be displayed before or after you sign in to an environment from Copilot for Sales.

## Cause

The [Administration mode](/power-platform/admin/admin-mode) is enabled for the environment, and the affected users aren't administrators.

When an administrator enables the **Administration mode** for an environment, regular users, regardless of their role assignment, can't access the environment. The user who is already signed in or tries to sign in to the environment can't access data from the environment and will see the error message.
