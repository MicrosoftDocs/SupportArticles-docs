Select **Copy error details** to view the error details. If the error includes **ContainsBlockedWord**, see the **Resolution** section of this article.

## Cause

The [Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams naming policy](/microsoft-365/solutions/groups-naming-policy) enforces a consistent naming strategy for Microsoft 365 groups and teams created by users in your organization. If a word in the team or channel name is blocked by the naming policy, the creation of such a team or channel fails.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:  

- Contact your administrator to update the naming policy according to the [Microsoft 365 Groups and Microsoft Teams naming policy](/microsoft-365/solutions/groups-naming-policy).
- Use a team or channel name without blocked words and create the team again.
