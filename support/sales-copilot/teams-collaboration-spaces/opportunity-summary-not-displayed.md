> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Sales Copilot is rebranded as Microsoft Copilot for Sales in January 2024. The screenshots in this article will be updated with the new name soon.

## Symptoms

## Cause

The Copilot for Sales Teams app isn't installed.

When you [set up a deal room](/microsoft-sales-copilot/set-up-team-deal-room-template) from Copilot for Sales in Outlook, the Copilot for Sales Teams app and bot are automatically installed for the selected team, and the opportunity summary is displayed in the deal room. If the Copilot for Sales Teams app isn't installed for the team, a message is displayed instead of the opportunity summary in the deal room.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, you must manually install the Copilot for Sales Teams app and bot for the team, and then generate the opportunity summary again.

1. In Microsoft Teams, hover over the team name, and then select **More options (...)** > **Manage team**.

2. Go to the Apps tab, and then select **Get more apps**.

3. Search for **Copilot for Sales**, and then select its card.

4. Select the down arrow next to **Open**, and then select **Add to a team**.
