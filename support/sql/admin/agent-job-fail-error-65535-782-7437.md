# SQL Agent job that executes a distributed query may fail with 65535, 782 or 7437 error messages

This article helps you resolve the problem where SQL Agent job that executes a distributed query may fail with 65535, 782 or 7437 error messages.

## Symptoms

A SQL Agent job that executes a distributed (linked server) query may fail with one of the error messages similar to the following, when the owner of the job is not a member of the sysadmin  server role:

- > OLE DB provider "\<provider name>" for linked server "\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "Login timeout expired".  
OLE DB provider "\<provider name>" for linked server ""\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server. When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections.".  
Msg 65535, Level 16, State 1, Line 0  
SQL Network Interfaces: Error Locating Server/Instance Specified [xFFFFFFFF].

- > Msg 782, Level 16, State 1, Line 0  
SSL Provider: No credentials are available in the security package  
*OLE DB provider "* \<provider name> *" for linked server "\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "Client unable to establish connection".*  

For example in SQL Server 2008 environment the error messages may be similar to the following:

- > OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI" for linked server "\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "Login timeout expired".  
OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI" for linked server ""\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server. When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections.".  
Msg 65535, Level 16, State 1, Line 0  
SQL Network Interfaces: Error Locating Server/Instance Specified [xFFFFFFFF].

- > Msg 782, Level 16, State 1, Line 0  
SSL Provider: No credentials are available in the security package
*OLE DB provider "SQLNCLI10" for linked server "\<Linkedserver Name>" returned message "Client unable to establish connection".*  

- > Msg 7437, Level 16, State 1, Line 3  
Linked servers cannot be used under impersonation without a mapping for the impersonated login.

You may also see the same behavior when using `Openquery` or when executing a distributed query using impersonation through `Execute as Login` T-SQL statement.

## Cause

Transact-SQL job step runs as the owner of the job step if the owner of the job step is not a member of the sysadmin fixed server role. SQL Agent uses `Execute as Login` to execute the job step under the context of the owner of the job step. You cannot use `EXECUTE AS` statement across server boundaries. This behavior is by design. For more information, see the following topics in SQL Server Books Online:

- [EXECUTE AS (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/statements/execute-as-transact-sql)
- [Extending Database Impersonation by Using EXECUTE AS](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms188304(v=sql.105))

> [!NOTE]
> The same cause applies to the scenario wherein you manually try to change the execution context of a distributed query in management studio using EXECUTE AS statement.

## Workaround

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following workaround requires you to define an explicit local server login to remote server login mappings using the Security page under Properties of the linked server object. Since the Remote User column must be a SQL Server Authentication login on the remote server, the remote server's authentication mode should either already be set to Mixed mode or should be changed to Mixed mode before using the workaround discussed below.

If a T-SQL job step is owned by a user that is not part of *sysadmin* server role and if the step contains a distributed query take the following steps to ensure the jobs or queries do not fail:

1. Create a mapping for each of the job-step owner on the local server to an existing or new login on the remote server.
2. Ensure that the login has sufficient privileges to execute various modules on the remote server that are accessed in the distributed query. For more information,see [Linked Server Properties (Security Page)](/previous-versions/sql/sql-server-2008-r2/ms188477(v=sql.105)).

## More information

Sometimes you may notice that queries discussed in either of the scenarios in Symptoms section may run successfully. This usually occurs when the impersonated user had previously logged on to the remote system and the system still has kept open a connection established by the remote use. You should not expect that the query will work all the time.

Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. On your SQL instance, create a linked server to another SQL instance either using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or the following script.

    ```sql
    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedserver @server = <server name>, @srvproduct=N'SQL Server'
    /* For security reasons the linked server remote logins password is changed with ######## */
    EXEC master.dbo.sp_addlinkedsrvlogin @rmtsrvname=<servername> ,
    @useself=N'True',@locallogin=NULL,@rmtuser=NULL,@rmtpassword=NULL
    ```

2. Execute the following query in SSMS using a login that is a member of Sysadmin server role and ensure it works fine.

    ```sql
    select * from <servername>.master.sys.sysobjects
    ```

3. Now change the context of the query to a non-sysadmin account and execute the same query.

    ```sql
    execute as login='Domain\Login1'
    go
    select suser_sname()
    go
    select * from <servername>.master.sys.sysobjects
    go
    ```

This step fails with the error mentioned in the Symptoms section of the article.

> [!NOTE]
> `OPENROWSET` and `OPENDATASOURCE` functions are not affected by  this issue as these functions include the credentials as parameters.  
> `BEGIN DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION` is a seperate statement that does not get its own credentials and is not affected by this issue. However, if linked server security is not properly configured, these statements can still fail.
