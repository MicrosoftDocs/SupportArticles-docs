# The SQL Server service and the SQL Server Agent Service fail to start on a standalone server

This article helps you resolve the problems where the SQL Server service and the SQL Server Agent Service may not start on a standalone server.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 307288

## Symptoms

- Issue 1: On a standalone server, the MSSQLSERVER service may fail to start, and you receive the following error message:

  > An error 1068 - (The dependency service or group failed to start.) occurred while performing this service operation on the MSSQLServer Service.

- Issue 2: Similarly, the SQLServerAgent service may also fail to start, and you receive the following error message:

  > An error 1068 - (The dependency service or group failed to start.) occurred while performing this service operation on the SQLServerAgent Service.

  Issue 1 and Issue 2 occur when both of the following conditions are true:

  - The server computer is in a workgroup and not part of a domain.
  - Both the MSSQLSERVER and SQLServerAgent services are set to use a domain account for the startup.

- Issue 3: On a domain member server, the MSSQLSERVER service may not start during the server start, and you receive the following error message:

  > The MSSQLSERVER service was unable to log on as domain\mssqlsvc with the currently configured password due to the following error: Source: NetLogon Description: There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. The MSSQLSERVER service terminated unexpectedly.

This problem occurs when all the following conditions are true:

- The server is part of a domain.
- Both the MSSQLSERVER and SQLServerAgent services are set to use a domain account for the startup.
- The startup mode for the MSSQLSERVER and SQLServerAgent are set to Automatic.

## Cause

The Issue 1 and Issue 2 occurs because the server is a standalone computer, the NetLogon service does not start on the server, hence no domain-wide logon authentications are possible.

The Issue 3 occurs because SQL Server services try to start before NetLogon service starts.

## Resolution

To fix the Issue 1 and Issue 2, follow these steps:

- Change the startup account of both the MSSQLSERVER and SQLServerAgent to use the local system account.

- Restart the server.

To fix the Issue 3, use the following workarounds:

- Configure the SQL Server startup to **delayed start** for particular Windows servers, other Windows services such as NetLogon complete first and SQL Server starts without problems.

- Configure the SQL Server startup to **retry**, the startup can be completed on the second startup attempt.

- Change the Duplicate Address Detection (-DadTransmits) value to 1 for all network interfaces on the server. See command [Set-NetIPInterface](/powershell/module/nettcpip/set-netipinterface) for more information.

- Change the **Recovery** options for SQL Server and SQL Server Agent services. Specify **Restart the service** as action for the failure options. You can perform this option from the Services applet of Administrative Tools using the familiar Service Control Manager interfaces.

If the **delayed start** option can't fix this Issue 3, you can add the following dependencies to the SQL Server service:

- Ip helper service
- Server Service
- Network list service

You can add the dependencies by using the following command:

```sql
sc.exe qc MSSQLSERVER ::view dependencies sc.exe config MSSQLSERVER depend=iphlpsvc/LanmanServer/netprofm ::add service dependencies
```

## More information

On a standalone computer, the NetLogon Service should be set for **manual** startup.
