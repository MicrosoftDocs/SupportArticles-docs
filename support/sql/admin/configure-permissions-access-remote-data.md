# Configuring permissions to access remote data from an OLEDB datasource in SQL Server

This article describes how to disable ad hoc queries that use the `OPENROWSET` or the `OPENDATASOURCE` functionality in SQL Server.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 327489

## Summary

You can use `OPENROWSET` or `OPENDATASOURCE` statements in SQL server as an ad hoc method to connect and access data from a remote OLEDB provider including a remote SQL Server instance. These statements can be used to access remote data from OLE DB data sources only when the **DisallowAdhocAccess** registry option is explicitly set to 0 for the specified provider, and the Ad Hoc Distributed Queries advanced configuration option is enabled. When these options are not set, the default behavior does not allow for ad hoc access.

This article provides additional details on configuring **DisallowAdhocAccess** through registry settings as well as SQL Server Management Studio and the default behavior.

## Disable Transact-SQL statements

> [!NOTE]
> Ad hoc access of remote OLE BD data sources using `OPENROWSET` and `OPENDATASOURCE` is disabled by default and no additional configuration is necessary. You need to use the procedures below only if this remote access has previously been explicitly enabled.

You can  disable Transact-SQL statements that use ad-hoc connection strings with specific OLE DB providers in the `OPENROWSET` and `OPENDATASOURCE` functions using one of the procedures below:

Specify the `DisallowAdHocAccess` Property for the provider in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. Open SSMS and expand Providers under Linked Servers

1. Click to select the OLE DB provider you want to use, and then click the **Provider Options** button.

1. Scroll down and select the **Disallow adhoc access** property check box and click **OK**.

Manually Modify the Registry and Add the `DisallowAdHocAccess` Value.

> [!NOTE]
> The two illustrations are just examples of how you can change the OLE DB provider for both ODBC and for the SQL Server OLE DB provider. If you want to use a different OLE DB provider, then you must modify that Provider's entry.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

## Specify the DisallowAdHocAccess property when you create a linked server

When you create a linked server on a computer that is running SQL Server, you can specify the `DisallowAdHocAccess` property for the OLE DB provider. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open SQL Server Enterprise Manager, and then click to select the Security folder of the server in question.
2. Right-click the Linked Servers entry, and then click New Linked Server.
3. Click to select the OLE DB provider you want to use, and then click the **Provider Options** button.
4. Scroll down and select the **Disallow adhoc access** property check box. Continue to finish the creation of your linked server entry.

## Manually modify the registry, and add the DisallowAdHocAccess value

After a linked server is saved, the DisallowAdHocAccess  property can be set only through a registry setting.

> [!NOTE]
> The two illustrations are just examples of how you can change the OLE DB provider for both ODBC and for the SQL Server OLE DB provider. If you want to use a different OLE DB provider, you must modify that provider's entry.

## Add the DisallowAdHocAccess value

To add the `DisallowAdHocAccess` value, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor.
2. Locate and then click the key in the registry: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Providers\<ProviderName>**  

   Example

   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Providers\MSDASQL`

3. On the **Edit** menu, click **Add Value**, and then add this registry value:

    ```console
    Value name: DisallowAdHocAccess
    Data type: REG_DWORD
    Radix: Hex
    Value data: 1
    ```

4. Quit Registry Editor.

## Enable ad-hoc remote access

After ensuring Ad Hoc Distributed Queries advanced configuration option is enabled, you need to `DisallowAdhocAccess` registry option is explicitly set to **0** for the specified provider.

To modify an existing `DisallowAdHocAccess` value, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor.
2. Locate and then click the DisallowAdHocAccess value under the key in the registry: **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Providers\<ProviderName>**  

   Example

   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Providers\Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0`

3. On the **Edit** menu, click **DWORD**, type *1*, and then click **OK**.

4. Quit Registry Editor. For a named instance, the registry key is different:
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\<Instance Name>\Providers\<ProviderName>`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - A change of the value of `DisallowAdHocAscess` from **1** to **0** would not require a restart of the SQL Service, whereas a change from **0** to **1** would have to have a SQL Service restart for the change that was made to become effective.
> - With the `DisallowAdHocAccess` property set to **1**, SQL Server does not allow ad hoc access through the `OPENROWSET` and the `OPENDATASOURCE` functions against the specified OLE DB provider. If you try to call these functions in ad hoc queries, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

  > Server: Msg 7415, Level 16, State 1, Line 1 Ad hoc access to OLE DB provider 'Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0' has been denied. You must access this provider through a linked server.

In other words, with the `DisallowAdHocAccess` property set to **1** for a specific OLE DB provider, you must use a predefined linked server setup for the specific OLE DB provider. You can no longer pass in an ad hoc connection string that references that provider to the `OPENROWSET` or the `OPENDATASOURCE` function.
