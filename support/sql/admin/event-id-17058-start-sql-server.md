# Event ID 17058 and SQL Server doesn't start

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; SQL Server

## Symptoms

If the Microsoft SQL Server service canâ€™t find the path that's configured to create error logs, the service doesn't start, and you receive  the following error message, depending on how you try to start the service:

- By using the Services applet:

  > Windows could not start the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service on Local Computer.  
  > Error 1067: The process terminated unexpectedly.

- By using a command prompt:

    > The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is starting.  
    > The SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service could not be started.  
    > A service specific error occurred: 13.  
    > More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3523.

## Resolution

1. Check the Application log, and verify that you see an error message entry that resembles the following:

    ```output
    Log Name:      Application  
    Source:        MSSQLSERVER  
    Date:          <Datetime>  
    Event ID:      17058  
    Task Category: Server  
    Level:         Error  
    Keywords:      Classic  
    User:          N/A  
    Computer:      <Server name>  
    Description:  
    initerrlog: Could not open error log file 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVR\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG'. 
    Operating system error = 3(The system cannot find the path specified.).  
    ```

2. Verify the path that's set for the ErrorLog file by using SQL Server Configuration Manager.

   You can also verify the path in the following registry entry:

   |Subkey|Data|
   |---|---|
   |`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQLServer\Parameters\SQLArg1`|-eC:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVR\MSSQL\Log\ERRORLOG|
   |||

3. Try to copy the path, and then manually verify in Windows Explorer or at a command prompt that you can access the target in the path. (Be aware of typos, special characters, and copy-and-paste issues.)

   Here's an incorrect command example that includes a typo:

   ```console
   C:\>dir  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVR\MSSQL\Log"
   ```

   > The system cannot find the path specified.

   Here's a correct command:

   ```console
   C:\>dir  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log"
   ```

   > Volume in drive C is Windows  
   > Volume Serial Number is 40B5-7ED1  
   >
   > Directory of C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log  
   >
   > \<Datetime>    \<DIR>          .  
   > \<Datetime>    \<DIR>          ..  
   > \<Datetime>            20,640 ERRORLOG  
   > \<Datetime>            14,082 ERRORLOG.1

4. Update the path to a valid folder in which the SQL Server startup account has permissions to create, read, write, and update files.

5. Restart the SQL Server service.
