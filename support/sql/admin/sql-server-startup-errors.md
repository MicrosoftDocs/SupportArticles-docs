# SQL Server startup errors on a standalone server

There are various reasons why SQL Server service might not start. At a high level, the causes can be classified into the following categories:

- Issues that affect the account that is configured to run the SQL Server service
- Inaccessible system databases
- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect configuration of the SQL Server service
- Issues that affect the certificate configuration

This topic helps you troubleshoot most common SQL Server startup issues in these categories on a standalone server.

> [!NOTE]
> The error message may vary slightly depending on the tool that you use. However, in general, the event IDs, error numbers, and descriptions are very similar.

## Steps to troubleshoot these problems

1. Note the error message that you receive from the tool when you start the service.
