## Symptoms

When a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) query is executed with a calculated measure in SSAS 2016, 2017 and 2019 tabular instance, the calculated measure runs slow and consumes lots of memories if it uses the `/` operator.

## Cause

An improved DIVIDE function allowing faster performance is available in both MDX and DAX. â€‹

## Resolution

Use the DIVIDE function instead of the `/` operator in the calculation.
