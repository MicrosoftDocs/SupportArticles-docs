# Open ADO connection and Recordset objects

This article introduces how to open ADO connection and Recordset objects.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 168336

## Summary

ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) offers several ways to open both the Connection and Recordset objects. This article presents sample code for several common techniques for each object.

## More information

There are several ways to open a Connection Object within ADO:

- By Setting the `ConnectionString` property to a valid Connect string and then calling the `Open()` method. This connection string is provider-dependent.
- By passing a valid Connect string to the first argument of the `Open()` method.
- By passing a valid Command object into the first argument of a Recordset's Open method.
- By passing the ODBC Data source name and optionally user-id and password to the Connection Object's `Open()` method.

There are three ways to open a Recordset Object within ADO:

- By opening the Recordset off the `Connection.Execute()` method.
- By opening the Recordset off the `Command.Execute()` method.
- By opening the Recordset object without a Connection or Command object, and passing a valid Connect string to the second argument of the `Recordset.Open()` method.

This code assumes that Nwind.mdb is installed with Visual Basic, and is located in the `C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VB directory`:

```vbnet
Option Explicit

Private Sub cmdOpen_Click()

    Dim Conn1 As New adodb.Connection
    Dim Cmd1 As New adodb.Command
    Dim Errs1 As Errors
    Dim Rs1 As New adodb.Recordset
    
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim AccessConnect As String
    
    ' Error Handling Variables

    Dim strTmp As String

    Done:
    Set Rs1 = Nothing
    
    Set Cmd1 = Nothing
    Set Conn1 = Nothing
    
    Exit Sub
    
    AdoError:
    i = 1
    On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Enumerate Errors collection and display properties of
    ' each Error object (if Errors Collection is filled out)
    Set Errs1 = Conn1.Errors
    For Each errLoop In Errs1
        With errLoop
            strTmp = strTmp & vbCrLf & "ADO Error # " & i & ":"

            i = i + 1
        End With
    Next

    strTmp = strTmp & vbCrLf & " Generated by " & Err.Source

    MsgBox strTmp
    
    ' Clean up gracefully without risking infinite loop in error handler
    On Error GoTo 0
    GoTo Done
End Sub

```

## ERROR NOTES

Only the ADO Connection object has an errors collection. The observant reader will notice that a lightweight error handler is in effect for the `RecordSet.Open` examples. In the event of an error opening a RecordSet object, ADO should return the most explicit error from the OLEDB provider. Some common errors that can be encountered with the preceding code follow.

If you omit (or there is an error in) the DefaultDir parameter in the connect string, you may receive the following error:

> ADO Error # -2147467259  
Description [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Driver] '(unknown)'  
isn't a valid path. Make sure that the path name is  
spelled correctly and that you are connected to the server  
on which the file resides.  
Source Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

If there is an error in the Dbq parameter in the connect string, you may receive the following error:

> ADO Error # -2147467259 Description [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access 97 Driver] Couldn't find
file '(unknown)'.  
Source Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

The preceding errors also populate the Connection errors collection with the following errors:

> ADO Error # -2147467259  
Description [Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Driver's  
SQLSetConnectAttr failed  
Source Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

> ADO Error # -2147467259  
Description Login Failed  
Source Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers

> [!NOTE]
> For each error, the ADO Error number is the same, in this case translating to 0x80004005, which is the generic E_FAIL error message. The underlying Component did not have a specific error number for the condition encountered, but useful information was never-the-less raised to ADO.
