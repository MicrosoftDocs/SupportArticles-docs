# Explicit misplaced SPN problem in SQL Server

This article helps you resolve a SQL Server consistent authentication problem that affects the explicit misplaced Service Principal Name (SPN).

## Symptoms

If the SPN that you specify in the connection string exists on a service account that's not used by Microsoft SQL Server, you receive a Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI) context error message.

If the SPN isn't registered correctly, you might receive the following error message:

> The target principal name is incorrect. Cannot generate SSPI context.

If you try to create an SPN that already exists, you receive the following error message:

> Duplicate SPN found, aborting operation!

## Cause

The explicit misplaced SPNs can cause issues in Kerberos authentication and prevent clients from connecting to the service.

## Resolution

If you are experiencing explicit misplaced SPNs, you might have to create or re-create the SPN for the service. To create or re-create the SPN by using the `SETSPN` command, follow these steps:

1. Run the `SETSPN -L domain\svcacct` command to list SPNs on the SQL Server service account.
1. Run the `SETSPN -Q spnName` command to learn which service account the SPN is registered on.
1. Run the `SETSPN -D` command to remove the SPN from the service.
1. Run the `SETSPN -A` command to add the SPN to the service.
1. Move the SPN by using `SETSPN -D`, or select an SPN that already exists in the correct account.
