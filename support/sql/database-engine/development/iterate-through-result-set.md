# Iterate through a result set by using Transact-SQL in SQL Server

This article describes various methods that you can use to iterate through a result set by using Transact-SQL in SQL Server.

## Summary

This article describes various methods that you can use to simulate a cursor-like `FETCH`-`NEXT` logic in a stored procedure, trigger, or Transact-SQL batch.

## Use Transact-SQL Statements to Iterate Through a Result Set

Here are three methods you can use to iterate through a result set by using Transact-SQL statements. The examples below use the Production.Product table from the [AdventureWorks sample database](/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure)

One method is the use of temp tables. With this method, you create a snapshot of the initial `SELECT` statement and use it as a basis for cursoring. For example:

```SQL
/********** example 1 **********/
SET NOCOUNT ON
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #MYTEMP 
DECLARE @ProductID int

SELECT * INTO #MYTEMP FROM Production.Product

SELECT TOP(1) @ProductID = ProductID FROM #MYTEMP

WHILE @@ROWCOUNT <> 0
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM #MYTEMP WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
    DELETE FROM #MYTEMP WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
    SELECT TOP(1) @ProductID = ProductID FROM #MYTEMP
END
```

A second method is to use the `min` function to walk a table one row at a time. This method catches new rows that were added after the stored procedure begins execution, provided that the new row has a unique identifier greater than the current row that is being processed in the query. For example:

```SQL
/********** example 2 **********/
SET NOCOUNT ON
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #MYTEMP 
DECLARE @ProductID int

SELECT @ProductID = min( ProductID ) FROM Production.Product
WHILE @ProductID IS NOT NULL

BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductID = @ProductID
    SELECT @ProductID = min( ProductID ) FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductID > @ProductID
END
```

> [!NOTE]
> Both example 1 and 2 assume that a unique identifier exists for each row in the source table. In some cases, no unique identifier may exist. If that's the case, you can modify the temp table method to use a newly created key column. For example:

```SQL
/********** example 3 **********/
SET NOCOUNT ON
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #MYTEMP 

SELECT NULL AS mykey, * INTO #MYTEMP FROM Production.Product

UPDATE TOP(1) #MYTEMP SET mykey = 1

WHILE @@ROWCOUNT > 0
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM #MYTEMP WHERE mykey = 1
    DELETE FROM #MYTEMP WHERE mykey = 1
    UPDATE TOP(1) #MYTEMP SET mykey = 1
END
```
