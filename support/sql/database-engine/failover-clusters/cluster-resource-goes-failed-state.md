# A SQL Server cluster resource goes to a "failed" state when you try to bring the resource online in SQL Server

This article helps you resolve the problem that occurs if resource-specific registry keys are missing.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 883732

## Symptoms

When you try to bring a SQL Server cluster resource online for a virtual instance of Microsoft SQL Server, you may notice the following behavior:

- The SQL Server cluster resource goes to a "failed" state and doesn't come online.
- You receive a combination of the following error messages on the computer that owns the SQL Server cluster resource.

  - Error message 1

    An event that is similar to the following one is in the system event log:

## Cause

The resource-specific registry keys that correspond to the SQL Server cluster resource that you're trying to bring online are missing. This problem also occurs if the values that correspond to the resource-specific registry keys aren't correct.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).  

To resolve this problem, you must manually re-create the resource-specific registry keys that correspond to the SQL Server cluster resource. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select **Start** > **Run**, type *Regedit*, and then select **OK**.
2. In Registry Editor, locate and select the registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\<GUID>\Parameters`.

3. Create the following registry values in the **Parameters** registry key:

    For a default instance of SQL Server:

    - InstanceName

        Value Name: InstanceName  
        Value Type: REG_SZ  
        Value Data: MSSQLSERVER  

    - VirtualServerName

        Value Name: VirtualServerName  
        Value Type: REG_SZ  
        Value Data: \<Name of the virtual SQL server>

    For a named instance of SQL Server:

    - InstanceName

        Value Name: InstanceName  
        Value Type: REG_SZ  
        Value Data: \<SQL Server instance name corresponding to the virtual server>

    - VirtualServerName

        Value Name: VirtualServerName  
        Value Type: REG_SZ  
        Value Data: \<Name of the virtual SQL server>

4. Quit Registry Editor. After you create the resource-specific registry keys, you can bring the SQL Server cluster resource online successfully.

   If you notice that a SQL Server Agent cluster resource can't be brought online, you must create the same set of resource-specific keys that correspond to the SQL Server Agent cluster resource.
