# Unable to find an entry point error when updating SQL Server 2022

This article describes an issue where the command line generates an error message when applying a SQL Server 2022 Cumulative Update (CU).

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; SQL Server 2022 on Windows  

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a computer that's running an operating system (OS) that has an earlier build of the Windows OS than Windows 10 Build 20348, such as Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019.

- You apply a cumulative update (CU) to SQL Server 2022 using **setup.exe** from the command line. For information on how to run the setup from command line, see [Install and configure SQL Server on Windows from the command prompt](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server-from-the-command-prompt).

In this scenario, an exception occurs in the setup console during the update process, displaying the following error message:

> System.EntryPointNotFoundException: Unable to find an entry point named 'GetNumaNodeProcessorMask2' in DLL 'kernel32.dll'

## Cause

When **setup.exe** runs on an OS version where the [GetNumaNodeProcessorMask2 API](/windows/win32/api/systemtopologyapi/nf-systemtopologyapi-getnumanodeprocessormask2) is unavailable, an exception appears in the setup console.

## Resolution

No resolution steps are necessary as the exception doesn't affect the setup behavior or success of the update. The error message can be safely ignored.

## More information

This exception is only visible in the setup console when running **setup.exe** from the command line and only applies to CU15 and later.

For information on all cumulative updates released after the release of SQL Server 2022, see [SQL Server 2022 build versions](../../../releases/sqlserver-2022/build-versions.md).
