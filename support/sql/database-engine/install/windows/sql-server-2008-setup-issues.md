## Issue 2: The "Cluster Service verification" rule fails when you try to install a SQL Server 2008 R2 failover cluster instance

### Cause

This issue occurs if the COM-based MSClus.dll library isn't enabled.

> [!NOTE]
> The SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 R2 cluster Setup programs depend on the COM-based MSClus.dll library. If this library isn't enabled on the cluster node, the Setup fails.

### Resolution

To resolve this issue, do one of the following:

- Enable the Failover Cluster Automation Server feature on each node by using Server Manager. In Server Manager, expand **Remote Server Administration Tools**, expand **Feature Administration Tools**, expand **Failover Clustering Tools**, and then select **Failover Cluster Automation Server**.

- Run the following Windows PowerShell cmdlet on each node to enable the Failover Cluster Automation Server feature:

    ```powershell
    add-windowsfeature RSAT-Clustering-AutomationServer
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You must run this cmdlet at an elevated command prompt.
