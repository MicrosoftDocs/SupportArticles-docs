# SQL Server is not supported on a Windows operating system on which case sensitivity is enabled

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server 2012, SQL Server 2008, SQL Server 2005 \
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2860895

You can disable or enable Windows kernel case insensitivity by using the following registry key:

Path: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel` \
Value name: `obcaseinsensitive` \
Value type: `DWORD`

SQL Server relies on the Windows default value of 1 (one) for this key.

> [!NOTE]
> As soon as this key is set to 0 (zero) on a system on which SQL Server is installed, the operation of setting the key back to 1 (one) is not a tested scenario for SQL Server. Additionally, this behavior is not supported. Therefore, we recommend a clean reinstallation of SQL Server on a server on which this key has never been changed.
