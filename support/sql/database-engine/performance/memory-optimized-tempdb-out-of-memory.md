# Memory-optimized tempdb metadata (HkTempDB) out of memory errors

This article provides resolutions to troubleshoot out of memory issues related to the memory-optimized tempdb metadata feature.

## Symptoms

After you enable the memory-optimized tempdb metadata (HkTempDB) feature, you may see error [701](/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/mssqlserver-701-database-engine-error) indicating out of memory exceptions for tempdb allocations and SQL Server Service crashes. In addition, you may see that the memory clerk `MEMORYCLERK_XTP` for In-Memory OLTP (Hekaton) is growing gradually or rapidly and doesn't shrink back. As the XTP memory grows without an upper limit, you see the following error message in SQL Server:

> Disallowing page allocations for database 'tempdb' due to insufficient memory in the resource pool 'default'. See '`http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510837`' for more information.

When running a query on the [DMV](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/system-dynamic-management-views) [dm_os_memory_clerks](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-os-memory-clerks-transact-sql), you can see that pages memory allocated is high for memory clerk `MEMORYCLERK_XTP`. For example:

```sql
SELECT type, memory_node_id, pages_kb 
FROM sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
WHERE type = 'MEMORYCLERK_XTP'
```

Result:
  
```output
type                    memory_node_id                     pages_kb
------------------------------------------------------------ -------------- --------------------
MEMORYCLERK_XTP         0                                  60104496
MEMORYCLERK_XTP         64                                 0
```

## Diagnose the issue

To collect data to diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Collect a lightweight trace or extended event (XEvent) to understand tempdb workload, and find out if the workload has any long-running explicit transactions with DDL statements on temporary tables.

1. Collect the output of the following DMVs to analyze further.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM  sys.dm_os_memory_clerks
   SELECT * FROM  sys.dm_tran_database_transactions
   SELECT * FROM  sys.dm_tran_active_transactions
   -- from tempdb
   SELECT * FROM  tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers 
   SELECT * FROM  tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_transaction_stats
   SELECT * FROM  tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_gc_queue_stats
   SELECT * FROM  tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_object_stats
   SELECT * FROM  tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers
   ```

## Cause and resolution

By using the DMVs to verify the cause, you may see different scenarios of the issue. These scenarios can be divided into the following two categories. To resolve the issue, you can use the corresponding resolution for each scenario. For more information on how to alleviate the issue, see [Mitigation steps to keep memory-optimized tempdb metadata memory in check](#mitigation-steps-to-keep-memory-optimized-tempdb-metadata-memory-in-check).

### Gradual increase in XTP memory consumption

- Scenario 1

    The DMV [tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-xtp-system-memory-consumers-transact-sql) or [tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers](/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-db-xtp-memory-consumers-transact-sql) shows a large difference between allocated bytes and used bytes.

    **Resolution**: To resolve the issue, you can run the following commands in [SQL Server 2019 CU13](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5005679-cumulative-update-13-for-sql-server-2019-5c1be850-460a-4be4-a569-fe11f0adc535) or a later version that has a new procedure `sys.sp_xtp_force_gc` to free up allocated but unused bytes.

    ```sql
    /* Yes, 2 times for both*/
    Exec sys.sp_xtp_force_gc 'tempdb'
    GO
    Exec sys.sp_xtp_force_gc 'tempdb'
    GO
    Exec sys.sp_xtp_force_gc
    GO
    Exec sys.sp_xtp_force_gc
    ```

- Scenario 2

    The DMV `tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers` shows high values for allocated and used bytes for memory consumer types VARHEAP and LOOKASIDE.

    **Resolution**: Check for long-running explicit transactions involving DDL statements on temporary tables and resolve from the application side by keeping transactions short.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To reproduce this issue in a test environment, you can create an explicit [transaction](/sql/t-sql/language-elements/begin-transaction-transact-sql) by using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements on temporary table(s) and leave it open for a long time while other activity takes place.

- Scenario 3

    The DMV `tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers` shows high values for allocated and used bytes in a large object (LOB) allocator or table heap where `Object_ID`, `XTP_Object_ID` and `Index_ID` are `NULL`.

    **Resolution**: Apply [SQL Server 2019 CU16](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5011644-cumulative-update-16-for-sql-server-2019-74377be1-4340-4445-93a7-ff843d346896) for the issue [14535149](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5011644-cumulative-update-16-for-sql-server-2019-74377be1-4340-4445-93a7-ff843d346896?msclkid=f1148209c24811ecbfa6aa36a20ffa89#bkmk_14535149).

- Scenario 4

    Continuously growing "VARHEAP\Storage internal heap" XTP database memory consumer leads to out of memory error 41805.

    **Resolution**: The issue [14087445](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5003830-cumulative-update-25-for-sql-server-2017-357b80dc-43b5-447c-b544-7503eee189e9#bkmk_14087445) already identified and resolved in [SQL Server 17 CU25](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5003830-cumulative-update-25-for-sql-server-2017-357b80dc-43b5-447c-b544-7503eee189e9) and later versions is under examination to be ported over to SQL Server 2019.

### Sudden spike or rapid increase in XTP memory consumption

- Scenario 5

     The DMV `tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers` shows high values for allocated or used bytes in a table heap where `Object_ID` isn't `NULL`. The most common cause of this issue is a long-running, explicitly open transaction with DDL statements on temporary table(s). For example:

     ```sql
     BEGIN TRAN
         CREATE TABLE #T(sn int)
         …
         …
     COMMIT
     ```

     An explicitly open transaction with DDL statements on temporary tables won't allow the table heap and lookaside heap to be freed up for subsequent transactions by using TempDB metadata.

     **Resolution**: Check for long-running explicit transactions involving DDL statements on temporary tables and resolve from the application side by keeping transactions short.

## Mitigation steps to keep memory-optimized tempdb metadata memory in check

1. To avoid or resolve long-running transactions that use DDL statements on temporary tables, the general guidance is to keep transactions short.

1. Increase **max server memory** to allow for enough memory to operate in the presence of tempdb-heavy workloads.

1. Run `sys.sp_xtp_force_gc` periodically.

1. To protect the server from potential out of memory conditions, you can bind tempdb to a [Resource Governor resource pool](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/resource-governor-resource-pool). For example, create a resource pool by using `MAX_MEMORY_PERCENT = 30`. Then use the following [ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION](/sql/t-sql/statements/alter-server-configuration-transact-sql) command to bind the resource pool to memory-optimized tempdb metadata.

   ```sql
   ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED TEMPDB_METADATA = ON (RESOURCE_POOL = '<PoolName>');
   ```

   This change requires a restart to take effect, even if memory-optimized tempdb metadata is already enabled. For more information, see:

    - [Configuring memory-optimized tempdb metadata](/sql/relational-databases/databases/tempdb-database#configuring-and-using-memory-optimized-tempdb-metadata)

    - [Create a Resource Pool](/sql/relational-databases/resource-governor/create-a-resource-pool)

   > [!WARNING]
   > After binding HktempDB to a pool, the pool may reach its maximum setting and any queries that use tempdb may fail with out of memory errors. SQL Service will continue functioning but tempdb-heavy workload may be affected. You may see the following error:
   >
   > > Disallowing page allocations for database 'tempdb' due to insufficient memory in the resource pool 'HkTempDB'. See '`http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=510837`' for more information. XTP failed page allocation due to memory pressure: FAIL_PAGE_ALLOCATION 8

1. The memory-optimized tempdb metadata feature doesn't support every workload. For example, using explicit transactions with DDL statements on temporary tables that run for a long time will lead to the scenarios described. If you have such transactions in your workload and you can't control their duration, then perhaps this feature isn't appropriate for your environment. You should test extensively before using HkTempDB.

## More information

These sections provide more details about some of the memory components involved in memory-optimized tempdb metadata.

### Lookaside memory allocator

Lookaside in In-Memory OLTP is a thread-local memory allocator to help achieve fast transaction processing. Each thread object contains a collection of lookaside memory allocators. Each lookaside associated with each thread has a pre-defined upper limit on how much memory it can allocate. Once the limit is reached, the thread allocates memory from a spill-over shared memory pool (VARHEAP). The DMV `sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers` aggregates data for each lookaside type (`memory_consumer_type_desc = 'LOOKASIDE'`) and the shared memory pool (`memory_consumer_type_desc = 'VARHEAP'` and  `memory_consumer_desc = 'Lookaside heap'`).

### System-level consumers: tempdb.sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers

About 25 lookaside memory consumer types are the upper limit. When threads need more memory from those lookasides, the memory spills over to and is satisfied with lookaside heap. High values for used bytes could be an indicator of constant heavy tempdb workload and/or long-running open transaction that uses temporary objects.

```sql
-- system memory consumers @ instance  
SELECT memory_consumer_type_desc, memory_consumer_desc, allocated_bytes, used_bytes
FROM sys.dm_xtp_system_memory_consumers 
```

```output
memory_consumer_type_desc     memory_consumer_desc                   allocated_bytes      used_bytes

### Database-level consumers: tempdb.sys.dm_db_xtp_memory_consumers

- LOB allocator is used for system tables LOB/Off-row data.

- Table heap is used for system tables rows.

High values for used bytes could be the indicator of constant heavy tempdb workload and/or long-running open transaction that uses temporary objects.
