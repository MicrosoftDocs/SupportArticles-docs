# Recommended updates and configuration options for SQL Server 2017 and 2016 with high-performance workloads

This article describes a list of performance improvements and configuration options that are available for SQL Server 2016 and later versions.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server 2017 on Windows, SQL Server 2016  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4465518

## Introduction

This article describes the performance improvements and changes that are available for Microsoft SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016 through various product updates and configuration options.

We recommend that you consider applying these updates to improve the performance of SQL Server instances. The degree of improvement will depend on various factors, including workload pattern, contention points, processor layout (number of processor groups, sockets, NUMA nodes, and cores in a NUMA node), and the amount of available memory in the system.

The SQL Server support team has used these updates and configuration changes to achieve reasonable performance gains for customer workloads that use hardware systems that included several NUMA nodes and lots of processors. The support team will continue to update this article with other updates in the future.

> Definition: High-end systems  
A "high-end system" typically has multiple sockets, eight cores or more per socket, and a half terabyte or more of memory.

## Apply recommended updates and improve SQL Server performance

These recommendations for improving the performance of SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016 are grouped into five tables, as follows:

- [Table 1](#table-1-important-updates-and-trace-flags-for-high-end-systems) contains the most frequently recommended updates and trace flags for scalability on high-end systems.
- [Table 2](#table-2-general-considerations-and-best-practices-for-improving-the-performance-of-your-sql-server-instance) contains recommendations and guidance for other performance tuning.
- [Table 3](#table-3-important-changes-that-are-introduced-in-sql-server-2017-and-sql-server-2016) contains information about changes in behavior and default settings in SQL 2017 and 2016.
- [Table 4](#table-4-important-fixes-that-are-included-in-a-cu) contains other scalability fixes that were included together with a cumulative update (CU).
- [Table 5](#table-5-recommended-improvements-fixes-and-configuration-guidelines-for-sql-server-in-a-linux-environment) contains recommended fixes and configuration guidelines for SQL Server instances deployed in a Linux environment.

> [!NOTE]
> For additional context, see [Frequently used knobs to tune a busy SQL Server](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-support/frequently-used-knobs-to-tune-a-busy-sql-server/ba-p/318511).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you enabled the trace flags, make sure that you review the information in that article after you run the migration to SQL Server 2017 or SQL Server 2016. Many of the trace flags and configuration options that are listed in that article became default options in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016.  

## Table 1. Important updates and trace flags for high-end systems

Review the following table, and enable the trace flags in the **Trace flag** column after you make sure that your instance of SQL Server meets the requirements in the **Applicable version and build ranges** column.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - **Applicable version and build** indicates the specific update in which the change or trace flag was introduced. If no CU is specified, all CUs in the SP are included.
> - **Not applicable version and build** indicates the specific update in which the change or trace flag became the default behavior. Therefore, just applying that update will be enough to receive the benefits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you enable fixes that have trace flags in Always On environments, be aware that you have to enable the fix and trace flags on all the replicas that are part of the Availability Group.

## Table 3. Important changes that are introduced in SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016

SQL Server 2017 and SQL Server 2016 contains several improvements in the areas of scalability and performance. Various configuration changes and trace flags that are required in SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2012 became the default behavior in SQL Server 2017 and 2016.

## Table 4. Important fixes that are included in a CU

Review the description in the **Symptoms** column and apply the required updates (preferably the latest update that contains the specific fix) in the **Required update** column in applicable environments. You can review the Knowledge Base article for more information about the respective issues. These recommendations don't require you to enable other trace flags as startup parameters unless it's explicitly called out in the article or in this table. Just applying the latest CU or Service Pack that includes these fixes is enough to get the benefit.

**Note** The CU name in the **Required update** column provides the first CU of SQL Server that resolves this issue. A cumulative update contains all the hotfixes and all the updates that were included together with the previous SQL Server update release. As noted in the updates to the [SQL Server Incremental Servicing Model](/archive/blogs/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-updates-to-the-sql-server-incremental-servicing-model-ism), we recommend that you install [the latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/957826) in an ongoing proactive cadence to resolve or prevent the issues that are described. Also note that starting in SQL Server 2017, the [Modern Servicing Model for SQL Server](/archive/blogs/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-the-modern-servicing-model-for-sql-server) was introduced so that service packs are no longer made available.

## Table 5: Recommended improvements, fixes, and configuration guidelines for SQL Server in a Linux environment

This table is a compilation of all key improvements, recommendations, and code changes that were released in cumulative updates after SQL Server 2017 was released. Review the description in the **Symptoms** column, and apply the required updates (preferably the latest update that contains the specific fix) in the **Required update** column in applicable environments. You can review the listed Knowledge Base article for more information about the respective issues.

These recommendations don't require you to enable other trace flags as startup parameters unless it's explicitly called out in the article or in this table. Just applying the latest cumulative update or service pack that includes these fixes is enough to get the benefit. If you're using Always On Availability Group in SQL Server on Linux, upgrade SQL Server 2017 to Cumulative Update 8 or higher since several improvements were delivered in this update.
    **Note** The CU name in the **Required update** column provides the first cumulative update of SQL Server that resolves this issue. A cumulative update contains all the hotfixes and all the updates that were included with the previous SQL Server update release. As noted in the updates to the [SQL Server Incremental Servicing Model](/archive/blogs/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-updates-to-the-sql-server-incremental-servicing-model-ism), we now recommend that you install [the latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/957826) in an ongoing proactive cadence to resolve or prevent the issues that are described. Also note that starting with SQL Server 2017, the [Modern Servicing Model for SQL Server](/archive/blogs/sqlreleaseservices/announcing-the-modern-servicing-model-for-sql-server) was introduced so that service packs are no longer made available.
