# 20011 error messages in SQL Server when the Replication Log Reader Agent fails

This article describes troubleshooting steps that might help resolve problems that occur after the Replication Log Reader Agent fails in SQL Server.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2892635

## Symptoms

When the Replication Log Reader Agent fails in Microsoft SQL Server, you receive an error message that resembles the following in the SQL Server log:

> \<Time stamp> spid98 Replication-Replication Transaction-Log Reader
Subsystem: agent logreadername failed. The process could not execute 'sp_replcmds'
on '\<Server name>'.
\<Time stamp> spid258 Error: 14151, Severity: 18, State: 1.
\<Time stamp> spid258 Replication-Replication Transaction-Log Reader
Subsystem: agent logreadername failed. The process could not execute 'sp_replcmds'
on '\<Server name>'.

Additionally, you may receive one or more error messages that resemble the following:

## Troubleshooting

- Error message 1: "18805/18836 LogReader Failed to Construct Replicated Command"

  From this message, you can determine the object and the change that created the transaction in the log. To do this, use the following information:

  - Code 18836 gives you the ID of the page on which you can find the object.

      > [!NOTE]
      >  You can use the [How to use DBCC PAGE](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server/how-to-use-dbcc-page/ba-p/383094) to view the contents of database pages.

  - Code 18805 gives you a log sequence number (LSN) that can provide the object:

    ```sql
    dbcc Log(master, 3, 'lsn', '0x00000208:000000a0:0004', 'numrecs', 1)
    ```

- Error message 2: "18805/18836 LogReader Failed to Construct Replicated Command"

  The main difference between error message 1 and error message 2 is that error 2 doesn't contain the status message and doesn't point to the "textinfo" column. This known issue is fixed in [Cumulative update package 11 for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 3 (SP3)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2834048).

The issue occurs only on those tables that have binary large object (BLOB) data type columns and for which the article isn't using the parameterized commands in order to replicate. To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

  1. Determine whether the article is using parameterized commands. To do this, run the following query:

     ```sql
     SELECT STATUS, NAME FROM sysarticles WHERE NAME =''
     ```

  2. Convert the status values into binary format. For example, for a status value of 41, the binary value is 101001, and the fifth bit from the right side, also known as the status bit, is ON. If the status bit is 1, then it is already set. If the status bit is 0, then it is not set. Therefore, you have to run `sp_changearticle` to configure the parameterized commands. To change the status bit, run the following command:

     ```sql
     sp_changearticle 'ConstituentRequest_ETL_Trans', 'CRProfile', 'status', 'parameters'
     ```

- Error message 3: **LogReader Timeout**

  To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

  - Increase the value for the Log Reader Agent's *QueryTimeout* parameter.

      > [!NOTE]
      >  By default, the value for this parameter is 1,800 seconds (30 minutes).

  - Set the value for the *QueryTimeout*  parameter to zero (0) to disable time-out.

  - Reduce the value for the Log Reader Agent's *ReadBatchSize* parameter.

If the assertion in the error log matches the issues in these Knowledge Base articles, install the appropriate fix.
