# Create database permission is logged to the Audit log when you run RESTORE VERIFYONLY

This article provides more information on why a `CREATE DATABASE` event can be logged when server audit is specified on a SQL Server instance.

## Symptoms

Assume that you set up a SQL Server audit to have a server audit specification that uses the `DATABASE_CHANGE_GROUP` event. When a user runs `RESTORE VERIFYONLY` on a database backup file, the `CREATE DATABASE` permission is logged to the Audit log.

## Cause

The `CREATE DATABASE` permission is required to run `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`. When that permission is checked, a corresponding event is logged to the Audit log for the `DATABASE_CHANGE_GROUP` audit specification.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use a query such as the following to filter the Audit log records that are related to running `RESTORE VERIFYONLY`:

```sql
select * from fn_get_audit_file('C:\path\to\file.sqlaudit', default, default) where statement NOT LIKE '%RESTORE VERIFYONLY%'
```
