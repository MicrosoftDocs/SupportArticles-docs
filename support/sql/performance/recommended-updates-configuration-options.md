# Recommended updates and configuration options for SQL Server with high-performance workloads

This article includes a list of performance improvements and configuration options that are available for SQL Server 2012 and later versions.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server 2014, SQL Server 2012  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2964518

## Apply the recommended updates and improve the performance of SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2012

This article describes the performance improvements and changes that are available for SQL Server 2014 and SQL Server 2012 versions through various product updates and configuration options. You can consider applying these updates in order to improve the performance of the instance of SQL Server. The degree of improvement that you see will depend on various factors that include workload pattern, contention points, processor layout (number of processor groups, sockets, NUMA nodes, cores in a NUMA node) and amount of memory present in the system. SQL Server support team has used these updates and configuration changes to achieve reasonable performance gains for customer workloads that used hardware systems that had several NUMA nodes and lots of processors. The support team will continue to update this article with other updates in the future.

High-end systems
A high-end system typically has multiple sockets, eight cores or more per socket, and a half terabyte or more of memory.

> [!NOTE]
> In SQL Server 2016 and later versions, many of the trace flags mentioned in this article is the default behavior and you don't have to enable them in those versions.

The recommendations are grouped into three tables as follows:

- [Table 1](#table-1-important-updates-and-trace-flags-for-high--end-systems) contains the most frequently recommended updates and trace flags for scalability on high-end systems.
- [Table 2](#table-2-general-considerations-and-best-practices-for-improving-performance-of-your-instance-of-sql-server) contains recommendations and guidance for additional performance tuning.
- [Table 3](#table-3-performance-fixes-that-are-included-in-a-cumulative-update) contains additional scalability fixes that were included together with a cumulative update.

## Table 1. Important updates and trace flags for high- end systems

Review the following table and enable the trace flags in the Trace flag column after you make sure that your instance of SQL Server meets the requirements in the **Applicable Version and build ranges** column.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Applicable Version and build indicates the specific update in which the change or trace flag was introduced. If no CU is specified, then all CU's in the SP are included.
>
> - Not Applicable Version and build indicates the specific update in which the change or trace flag became the default behavior. Therefore, just applying that update will be enough to get the benefits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you enable fixes with trace flags in Always On environments, please be aware that you have to enable the fix and trace flags on all the replicas that are part of the Availability Group.

## Table 3. Performance fixes that are included in a cumulative update

Review the description in the Symptoms column and apply the required updates in the Required update column in applicable environments. You can review the Knowledge Base article for more information about the respective issues. These recommendations do not require you to enable additional trace flags as startup parameters. Just applying the latest Cumulative Update or Service Pack that includes these fixes is enough to get the benefit.

> [!NOTE]
> The CU name in the **Required update** column provides the first cumulative update of SQL Server that resolves this issue. A cumulative update contains all the hotfixes and all the updates that were included with the previous SQL Server update release. Therefore, we recommend that you install [the latest cumulative update](https://support.microsoft.com/help/957826) in order to resolve the issues.

## Important notes

- If all the conditions in the Table 1 apply to you:

  - Guidance for SQL Server 2014: Apply at least [Cumulative Update 1 for SQL Server 2014](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2931693) for RTM and add "-T8048 -T9024 -T1236 -T1117 -T1118" to SQL Server start up parameter list.
  - Guidance for SQL Server 2012: Apply [SP2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=43340) and add "-T8048 -T9024 -T1236 -T1117 -T1118" to SQL Server start up parameter list.
- For general information about how to use trace flags, check the [DBCC TRACEON - Trace Flags (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/database-console-commands/dbcc-traceon-trace-flags-transact-sql) topic in SQL Server Books Online.
