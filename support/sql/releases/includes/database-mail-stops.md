Database Mail stops working after you install this cumulative update. You might see the following error message:

> Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.SqlServer.DatabaseMail.XEvents, Version=17.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

If you already downloaded this cumulative update and currently use or plan to start using Database Mail, don't install this update until a fix is available.

If you already installed this update, [uninstall it](/sql/sql-server/install/uninstall-a-cumulative-update-from-sql-server) to restore Database Mail functionality.
