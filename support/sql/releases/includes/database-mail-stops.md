Database Mail stops working after you install this cumulative update. You might see the following error message:

```output
Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.SqlServer.DatabaseMail.XEvents, Version=17.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89845dcd8080cc91' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
```

If you use Database Mail, don't install this update until a fix is available.

If you already installed this update, [uninstall it](/sql/sql-server/install/uninstall-a-cumulative-update-from-sql-server) to restore Database Mail.
