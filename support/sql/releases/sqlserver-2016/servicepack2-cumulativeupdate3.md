If the download page doesn't appear, contact [Microsoft Customer Service and Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=support) to obtain the cumulative update package.

> [!NOTE]
> After future cumulative updates are released for SQL Server 2016, this CU can be located and downloaded from the [Microsoft Windows Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=sql%20server%202016). However, we recommend that you always install the latest cumulative update that is available.

## Notes for this update

<details>
<summary><b>Cumulative update</b></summary>

Cumulative updates (CU) are now available at the Microsoft Download Center.

Only the most recent CU that was released for SQL Server 2016 SP2 is available at the Download Center.

- Each new CU contains all the fixes that were included with the previous CU for the installed version/Service Pack of SQL Server.
- Microsoft recommends ongoing, proactive installation of CUs as they become available:
  - SQL Server CUs are certified to the same levels as Service Packs, and should be installed at the same level of confidence.
  - Historical data shows that a significant number of support cases involve an issue that has already been addressed in a released CU.
  - CUs might contain added value over and above hotfixes. This includes supportability, manageability, and reliability updates.
- Just as for SQL Server service packs, we recommend that you test CUs before you deploy them to production environments.
- We recommend that you upgrade your SQL Server installation to [the latest SQL Server 2016 service pack](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3177534).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Hybrid environments deployment</b></summary>

When you deploy an update to a hybrid environment (such as Always On, replication, cluster, and mirroring), we recommend that you refer to the following articles before you deploy the update:

- [Upgrade a failover cluster instance](/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/upgrade-a-sql-server-failover-cluster-instance)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't want to use the rolling update process, follow these steps to apply an update:
    >
    > - Install the update on the passive node.
    > - Install the update on the active node (requires a service restart).

- [Upgrade and update of availability group servers that use minimal downtime and data loss](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn178483.aspx)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you enabled Always On together with the **SSISDB** catalog, see the [information about SSIS with Always On](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-integration-services/ssis-with-alwayson/ba-p/388091) about how to apply an update in these environments.

<summary><b>Language support</b></summary>

SQL Server Cumulative Updates are currently multilingual. Therefore, this cumulative update package isn't specific to one language. It applies to all supported languages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Components (features) updated</b></summary>

One CU package includes all available updates for all SQL Server 2016 components (features). However, the cumulative update package updates only those components that are currently installed on the SQL Server instance that you select to be serviced. If a SQL Server feature (for example, Analysis Services) is added to the instance after this CU is applied, you must reapply this CU to update the new feature to this CU.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Support for this update</b></summary>

If other issues occur, or if any troubleshooting is required, you might have to create a separate service request. The usual support costs will apply to additional support questions and to issues that don't qualify for this specific cumulative update package. For a complete list of Microsoft Customer Service and Support telephone numbers, or to create a separate service request, go to the [Microsoft support website](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=support).
