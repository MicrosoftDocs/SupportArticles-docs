## How to get SQL Server 2016 SP2

SQL Server 2016 SP2, Microsoft SQL Server 2016 SP2 Express, and Microsoft SQL Server 2016 SP2 Feature Pack are available for manual download and installation at the following Microsoft Download Center websites.

- [SQL Server 2016 SP2](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56836)
- [SQL Server 2016 SP2 Express](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56840)
- [SQL Server 2016 SP2 Feature Pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56833)

> [!NOTE]
> After you install the service pack, the SQL Server service version should be **13.0.5026.0** Microsoft SQL Server 2016 service packs are cumulative updates. SQL Server 2016 SP2 upgrades all editions and service levels of SQL Server 2016 to SQL Server 2016 SP2.

## Uninstalling SQL Server 2016 SP2 (not recommended)

If, for any reason, you choose to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP2, the uninstallation of SQL Server 2016 SP2 will not be blocked, and you will be able to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP2 in the same manner as any other service packs. However, if you are running the Standard, Web, or Express edition of SQL Server, and you are using some new features that are unlocked only when you start SQL Server 2016 SP2, you might experience errors or see databases left in a suspect state after the uninstallation of SQL Server 2016 SP2. Even worse, if the system databases are using new features (for example, partitioned tables in master databases), this could prevent SQL Server instances from starting after you uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP2.

We recommend that you verify that all the new features are disabled or dropped before you choose to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP2 on editions other than the Enterprise edition. You can't drop the [memory_optimized_data](/sql/relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/the-memory-optimized-filegroup) filegroup. Therefore, if you have set up the `memory_optimized_data` filegroup on your database with SP2, you should not uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP2. Otherwise, the database will get into a suspect state, and the following entry will be logged in the error log:

> \<DateTime> spid15s Error: 41381, Severity: 21, State: 1.  
> \<DateTime> spid15s The database cannot be started in this edition of SQL Server because it contains a MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA filegroup. See Books Online for more details on feature support in different SQL Server editions.
