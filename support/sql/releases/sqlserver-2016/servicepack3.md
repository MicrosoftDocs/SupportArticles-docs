## Notes for this update

For more information about how to upgrade your SQL Server installation to SQL Server 2016 SP3, see [Supported Version and Edition Upgrades](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/supported-version-and-edition-upgrades).

<details>
<summary><b>Uninstalling SQL Server 2016 SP3 (not recommended)</b></summary>

If, for any reason, you choose to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP3, the uninstallation of SQL Server 2016 SP3 will not be blocked, and you will be able to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP3 in the same manner as any other service packs. However, if you are running the Standard, Web, or Express edition of SQL Server, and you are using some new features that are unlocked only when you start SQL Server 2016 SP3, you might experience errors or see databases left in a suspect state after the uninstallation of SQL Server 2016 SP3. Even worse, if the system databases are using new features (for example, partitioned tables in master databases), this could prevent SQL Server instances from starting after you uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP3.

We recommend that you verify that all the new features are disabled or dropped before you choose to uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP3 on editions other than the Enterprise edition. You cannot drop the [memory_optimized_data](/sql/relational-databases/in-memory-oltp/the-memory-optimized-filegroup) filegroup on your database with SP3, you should not uninstall SQL Server 2016 SP3. Otherwise, the database will get into a suspect state, and the following entry will be logged in the error log:

> \<DateTime> Error: 41381, Severity: 21, State: 1.</br>\<DateTime> The database cannot be started in this edition of SQL Server because it contains a MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA filegroup. See Books Online for more details on feature support in different SQL Server editions.
