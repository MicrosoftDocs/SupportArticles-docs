# KB5050533 - Azure Connect feature pack for SQL Server 2017
a
_Release Date:_ &nbsp; March 06, 2025  
_Version:_ &nbsp; 14.0.3490.10

This article describes the Azure Connect feature pack for Microsoft SQL Server 2017.

## Improvements included in this feature pack

- Adds support for the [link feature](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/managed-instance-link-feature-overview) for Azure SQL Managed Instance, which enables database replication from SQL Server to [Azure SQL Managed Instance](/azure/azure-sql/managed-instance/sql-managed-instance-paas-overview).

- Adds improvement to enable distributed availability groups and service broker connections with Azure SQL Managed Instance.

- Adds improvement to certificate-based authentication between endpoints for database mirroring (Always On) and service broker connections, which facilitates rotation and management of certificates that are issued by a certificate authority.

- Adds improvement to use signed certificates that have multiple Domain Name System (DNS) names, which allows a selection of a single DNS name for securing database mirroring endpoints in SQL Server.

- Enables distributed availability groups in SQL Server Standard editions to establish database replication with Azure resources.
