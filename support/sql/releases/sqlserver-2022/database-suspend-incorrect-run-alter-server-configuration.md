# FIX: Database is suspended incorrectly when you run ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION

## Symptoms

When you run `ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION` to suspend the server for a snapshot backup, you might occasionally notice that the database is in an incorrect suspended state after an error occurs. The error that occurs when suspending the server for a snapshot backup is similar to the following error:

> Msg 9018, Level 16, State 1, Line \<LineNumber>  
> The log for database \<DatabaseName> does not allow user writes.
>
> Msg 5901, Level 16, State 1, Line \<LineNumber>  
> One or more recovery units belonging to database \<DatabaseName> failed to generate a checkpoint. This is typically caused by lack of system resources such as disk or memory, or in some cases due to database corruption. Examine previous entries in the error log for more detailed information on this failure.

After this error occurs, the suspended database count on the server shows 0, but not all the databases are unsuspended correctly.

This situation causes the following error when you run the `ALTER SERVER CONFIGURATION` command to suspend the server for a subsequent snapshot backup:

> Msg 3081, Level 16, State 4, Line \<LineNumber>  
> Database \<DatabaseName> was previously suspended for snapshot backup.
