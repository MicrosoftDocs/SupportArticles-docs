# Improvement: Make several enhancements to the SQLIOSim utility

## Summary

This improvement makes the following enhancements to the SQLIOSim utility and fixes data integrity issues that might be caused by I/O handling. For more information about the SQLIOSim utility, see the [Introduction of the SQLIOSim utility](../../tools/sqliosim-utility-simulate-activity-disk-subsystem.md#introduction).

### Enhanced logging

- Adds a new ring buffer to track errors, in order to make it unlikely that errors in the history ring buffer are replaced because of the rollover.
- Adds various outputs that contain "tick count" and/or "date and time" to make debugging an issue easier.
- Adds the outputs of `fsutil` and volume information to the error file, in order to map the file offset to the offset on the physical disk and filter the I/O subsystem traces easier.
- Adds the output for Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local time.
- Breaks down the output of the page header to the error file, such as PageId, Checksum, and Timestamp.
- Displays a list of the pages of the `FILE HISTORY` ring buffer to more easily locate ring buffer entries.
- Displays Timestamp, Date Time, Logical CPU, and other columns in the *Sqliosim.log.xml* or *ErrorLog.xslt* view.
- Increases the size of the ring buffers and reduces the frequency of the rollover.
- Provides hexadecimal and decimal outputs for common outputs such as PageId, Checksum, and Timestamp.
- Updates the layout of *Sqliosim.log.xml* to make it easier to read the XML file in a text editor.
- Validated *Sqliosim.log.xml* and *ErrorLog.xslt* can be viewed correctly in Microsoft Edge that uses Internet Explorer (IE) mode.

### Page header timestamp

Stores the `GetTickCount64` value in the page header during the write operations. The tick count is useful for tracking when the page is written and filtering the I/O subsystem traces.

### BNR (Bytes-Not-Read)

The I/O issue causes the read operation to be returned as if the read operation is successful, but the actual buffer isn't updated or read. The SQLIOSim utility receives a successful read, but fails the validation checks.

The SQLIOSim utility now stamps the read buffers by using the BNR pattern before issuing a read. When the read operation returns successfully but fails to perform the actual read, the validation continues to fail. However, the bytes read shows the .BNR pattern that indicates an I/O subsystem issue.

### Write-retry

If the I/O subsystem encounters a reset (more common in direct-attached storage (DAS) installations), the write operation requests might complete incorrectly. The SQLIOSim utility doesn't guarantee write-retry capabilities. In some cases, the SQLIOSim utility tries to read and validate the data that fails to write.

The SQLIOSim utility is enhanced to log a write failure and then perform a write-retry operation.

### Enhanced locking

The internal locking mechanisms and page protection (VirtualProtect) activity are optimized and enhanced to ensure that an issue reported by the SQLIOSim utility isn't caused by a logic flaw in the SQLIOSim utility.

### Read-retry

Fixes an issue that causes the read-retry attempt to fail when retrying a failed LDX (log simulation) read.

### Examples of the enhanced outputs

The first example of the enhanced output includes the following enhancements:

- UTC Time
- Hexadecimal and decimal
- Timestamp/Tick count
- BNR
- Page header expansion
