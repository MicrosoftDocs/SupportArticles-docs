# Description of Replay Markup Language Utilities for SQL Server

This article describes a group of tools that are used by support professionals to troubleshoot Microsoft SQL Server.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; SQL Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 944837

## Introduction

The SQL Server support team uses several internally written tools to help them work a typical customer support case. This article describes one particular tool suite, Replay Markup Language (RML) Utilities for SQL Server. Database developers and system administrators can use these tools.

## More information

You can use RML Utilities for SQL Server to do the following tasks:

- Determine which application, database, SQL Server login, or query is using the most resources.
- Determine whether the execution plan for a batch is changed when you capture the trace for the batch. Additionally, you can use RML Utilities for SQL Server to determine how SQL Server does each of these execution plans.
- Determine which queries are running slower than previously.

After you capture a trace for an instance of SQL Server, you can use RML Utilities for SQL Server to replay the trace file against another instance of SQL Server. If you also capture the trace during the replay, you can use RML Utilities for SQL Server to compare the new trace file to the original trace file. You can use this technique to test how SQL Server behaves after you apply changes. For example, you can use this technique to test how SQL Server behaves after you do the following tasks:

- Install a SQL Server service pack.
- Install a SQL Server hotfix.
- Update a stored procedure or a function.
- Update an index or create an index.

The current version of RML Utilities for SQL Server supersedes any earlier versions. You must uninstall any earlier version of RML Utilities for SQL Server before you install the current version. The current version of the tool suite contains important software updates, improved features (process .trc and .xel files) and reports, and performance and scalability improvements.

## Obtain the RML Utilities for SQL Server

After you install the [Database Experimentation Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54090), you will find the RML tools (`ReadTrace` and `OStress`) present in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Corporation\Database Experimentation Assistant\Dependencies\X64\` folder.

If you're using the RML tools together with the [SQL Nexus](https://github.com/microsoft/SqlNexus/wiki) tool, you can obtain `ReadTrace` and `ostress` from <https://github.com/microsoft/SqlNexus/releases/tag/09.04.0097>.

RML Utilities for SQL Server is available for download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://download.microsoft.com/download/7/A/D/7ADE5D8B-47AB-4E94-BAD0-5416D6B6D383/RMLSetup.msi).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft provides RML Utilities for SQL Server as is. Microsoft Customer Support Services (CSS) does not provide support or updates for the RML Utilities for SQL Server. If you have a suggestion or you want to report a bug, you can use the e-mail address in the "Problems and Assistance" topic in the Help file (_RML Help.pdf_). The Help file is included together with the RML Utilities for SQL Server.

## Benefits of RML Utilities for SQL Server

RML Utilities for SQL Server is useful if you want to simulate application testing when it's impractical or impossible to test by using the real application. In a test environment, it may be difficult to generate the same user load that exists in the production environment. You could use RML Utilities for SQL Server to replay a production workload in a test environment and assess the performance effect of changes. For example, you could test an upgrade to SQL Server 2008 or the application of a SQL Server service pack. Additionally, you can use RML Utilities for SQL Server to analyze and compare various replay workloads. This kind of regression analysis would otherwise be a difficult process that you would have to do manually.

The Help file contains a Quick Start topic. This topic includes a brief exercise that will familiarize you with every RML tool. To open the Help file, select **Start**, point to **All Programs**, point to **RML Utilities for SQL Server**, point to **Help**, and then select **RML Help**.

## Tools in RML Utilities for SQL Server

RML Utilities for SQL Server contains the following tools:

- ReadTrace
- Reporter
- OStress
- OStress Replay Control Agent (ORCA)

For a complete description of every tool and sample usage, see the RML Help file that's included in RML Utilities for SQL Server.

## Dependencies for RML Utilities for SQL Server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The applications that are provided as part of the RML tool suite require that several additional dependencies be available.
>
### Dependencies for Reporter

You have to make sure that the Report Viewer controls are available either in the same folder as Reporter.exe or in the Global Assembly Cache (GAC). The DLLs that Reporter.exe requires are:

- Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.dll
- Microsoft.ReportViewer.DataVisualization.dll
- Microsoft.ReportViewer.ProcessingObjectModel.dll
- Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms.dll

You can download these DLLs by using the following PowerShell script:

```powershell
Register-PackageSource -Name MyNuGet -Location https://www.nuget.org/api/v2 -ProviderName NuGet
Get-PackageSource

Find-Package Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common -AllVersions
Install-Package Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common -RequiredVersion 10.0.40219.1

Copy-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\NuGet\Packages\Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.10.0.40219.1\lib\Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.dll" -Destination "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\RMLUtils"
Copy-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\NuGet\Packages\Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.10.0.40219.1\lib\Microsoft.ReportViewer.DataVisualization.dll" -Destination "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\RMLUtils"
Copy-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\NuGet\Packages\Microsoft.ReportViewer.Common.10.0.40219.1\lib\Microsoft.ReportViewer.ProcessingObjectModel.dll" -Destination "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\RMLUtils"

Find-Package Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms -AllVersions

Copy-Item -Path "C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\NuGet\Packages\Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms.10.0.40219.1\lib\Microsoft.ReportViewer.WinForms.dll" -Destination "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\RMLUtils"
```

### Dependencies for Expander

Make sure that the compression and decompression controls are available either in the same folder as Expander.exe or in the GAC. The DLLs that Expander.exe requires are as follows:

- BRICOLSOFTZipx64.dll
- UnRar64.dll
- XceedZipX64.dll

You can obtain these DLLs from the respective software packages of the vendors.

- <https://www.rarlab.com/rar/UnRARDLL.exe>

- <https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-x64.exe>

- <https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xceed.Products.Zip.Full/>

## Examples

The following examples illustrate how to use some of the RML tools.

### A. Using ReadTrace.exe to import Xevent data in a database

Use ReadTrace.exe to import a series of Xevent files that are collected by using such tools as PSSDIAG/[SQLDiag.exe](/sql/tools/sqldiag-utility) or [SQL LogScout](https://github.com/microsoft/SQL_LogScout/releases). Use the `-I` parameter to point to the first .xel file that was collected in time, if multiple files are present. For all command-line switches, use `ReadTrace.exe /?`:

```console
ReadTrace.exe -Iserver_instance_20220211T1319480819_xevent_LogScout_target_0_132890707717540000.xel -oc:\temp\output -f -dPerfAnalysisDb -S.
```

### B. Using Ostress.exe to stress test a query

Use OStress to submit a query against a server that's running SQL Server by running 30 simultaneous connections and running the query 10 times on every connection. For all command-line switches, use `Ostress.exe /?`:

```console
ostress.exe -E -dmaster -Q"select name from sys.databases" -n30 -r10
```
