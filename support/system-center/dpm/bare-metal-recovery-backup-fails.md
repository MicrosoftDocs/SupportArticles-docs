# BMR backup fails in Data Protection Manager or Azure Backup Server

This article helps you fix an issue where a bare metal recovery (BMR) backup fails because of high input/output (I/O) latency in Microsoft Azure Backup Server or System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM).

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; System Center 2016 Data Protection Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4512842

## Symptoms

When you do a BMR backup by using Azure Backup Server or System Center Data Protection Manager, the backup fails. You receive one of the following error messages on the DPM server:

> DPM cannot create a backup because Windows Server Backup (WSB) on the protected computer encountered an error (WSB Event ID: 517, WSB Error Code: 0x6B48C3A0). (ID 30229 Details: Internal error code: 0x80990ED0)

The following error entries are logged on the protected server:

Please review the event details for a solution, and then rerun the backup operation once the issue is resolved.

> The server is responding over TCP but not over SMB. Ensure the Server service is running and responsive, and the disks do not have high per-IO latency, which makes the disks appear unresponsive to SMB. Also, ensure the server is responsive overall and not paused; for instance, make sure you can log on to it.

## Cause

Windows backup server writes directly to the DPM or Azure Backup Server share during backup. This issue occurs if the input/output (I/O) latency is greater than the standard SMB time-out (60 seconds).

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756).

To fix the issue, follow these steps:

1. On the protected server, open Registry Editor, and then add the `SessTimeout` registry entry as shown under the following subkey:

    |subkey|Name|Type|Data|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters`|SessTimeout|REG_DWORD|1200|

    > [!NOTE]
    > The 1,200 seconds (20 minutes) time-out is a recommended value. Adjust the value as appropriate. You can review the Resilient File System (ReFS) event logs on the DPM or Azure Backup Server server to find any suspected I/O latency.

2. Restart the protected server.

    If you can't restart the protected server, stop and restart the Workstation (Lanmanworkstation) service.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Make sure that you check the list of dependencies for the Workstation (Lanmanworkstation) service. The services that depend on this service must also be restarted.

## More information

When you use BMR backup, make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- The latest update for DPM or Azure Backup Server is installed.

- The replica size is set correctly. For more information, see [How to increase DPM 2016 replica when using Modern Backup Storage (MBS)](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/system-center-blog/how-to-increase-dpm-2016-replica-when-using-modern-backup/ba-p/351818).
