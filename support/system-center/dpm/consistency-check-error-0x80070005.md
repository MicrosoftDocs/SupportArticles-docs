## Cause

In a DPM 2010 primary - secondary configuration, the DPMRA service account on the primary DPM server is changed from the Local System account to a domain user account who is also part of the Local Admin group.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, DPM services should be configured to run using the Local System account on the primary DPM server.
