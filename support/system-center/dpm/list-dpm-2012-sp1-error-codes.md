|36|DPM cannot access the path \<_Component_> because part of the path has been deleted or renamed.|Check the path, and then enter it again.|
|37|DPM cannot access \<_FileName_> because an element has been exclusively locked by another process.|Try the selection later or check to see if the object is locked by another process.|
|38|DPM is unable to enumerate contents in \<_Component_> on the protected computer \<_ServerName_>. Recycle Bin, System Volume Information folder, non-NTFS volumes, DFS links, CDs, Quorum Disk (for cluster) and other removable media cannot be protected.|None.|
|39|DPM failed to access the path \<_FileName_>.|Verify the path exists and is accessible.|
|41|DPM failed to communicate with \<_ServerName_> because the computer is unreachable.|<br/>1. Make sure that \<_ServerName_> is online and remotely accessible from the DPM server.<br/>2. If a firewall is enabled on \<*ServerName*>, make sure that it is not blocking requests from the DPM server.<br/>3. If you are using a backup LAN, make sure that the backup LAN settings are valid.<br/>4. If you are using clustered remote SMB storage, you may see this error when a backup job tries to start just after the primary cluster owner is switched. If this is the case, wait for some time and retry the operation.|
|42|DPM failed to communicate with the protection agent on \<_ServerName_> because access is denied.|<br/>1. Verify that the DPM server has DCOM launch and access permissions for \<_ServerName_> and that the system time on the DPM server and the protected computer is synchronized with the system time on the domain controller.<br/>2. If this computer doesn't have to be protected any longer, you may want to remove the record for this computer from the database. To remove the record, in the **Management** task area, on the **Agents** tab, select the computer name. In the **Details** pane, select **Remove Record**.<br/>3. Make sure that your domain controller can be reached from the DPM server and the protected computer.<br/>4. If you are still having communication issues between DPM and the protected computer, review the event log on the DPM server and the protected computer for events related to communication issues.|
|43|DPM failed to communicate with the protection agent on \<_ServerName_> because the agent is not responding.|<br/>1. Check recent records from the DPMRA source in the Application Event log on _< ServerName>_ to find out why the agent failed to respond.<br/>2. Make sure that the DPM server is remotely accessible from \<_ServerName_>.<br/>3. If a firewall is enabled on the DPM server, make sure that it is not blocking requests from \<*ServerName*>.<br/>4. Restart the DPM Protection Agent service on \<*ServerName*>. If the service doesn't start, reinstall the protection agent.|
|45|DPM failed to communicate with the protection agent on \<_ServerName_> because the agent is not installed or the computer is restarting.|Install the protection agent. If the computer is in the process of restarting, allow some time for the computer to come online.|
|46|DPM failed to perform the operation because too many objects are selected. Select fewer objects, and then retry the operation.|<br/>- If you are trying to protect a large number of data sources on a volume, consider protecting the whole volume instead of individual data sources.<br/>- If you are trying to recover a large number of folders or files from a volume, consider recovering the parent folder, or divide the recovery into multiple operations.|
|47|Some components of the protection agent on \<_PSServerName_> were not installed or configured properly.|<br/>1. Verify that the targeted computer \<_PSServerName_> is not running an unsupported version of the operating system.<br/>2. Restart the computer \<*PSServerName*>. If the problem persists, on \<*PSServerName*>, uninstall the DPM protection agent by using Add or Remove Programs. Then, on the DPM server, in the Management task area, on the Agents tab, reinstall the protection agent on \<*PSServerName*>.|
|48| \<_ServerName_> needs to be restarted. This might be because the computer has not been restarted since the protection agent was installed.|Restart the server. If you have protected data on this server, synchronize the data by performing a consistency check after the restart.|
|49|The protection agent timed out while trying to access the file \<_FileName_> for volume \<_PSVolumeName_> on \<_PSServerName_>.|Make sure that the file is accessible. Synchronize the data with a consistency check.|
|50|The DPM protection agent on \<_PSServerName_> failed to perform a consistency check for file \<_FileName_> on volume \<_PSVolumeName_>.|Make sure that the file is available and rerun the consistency check.|
|51|Root directories were added to or removed from protection for volume \<_PSVolumeName_> on \<_PSServerName_>.|No action required.|
|52|The DPM service was unable to communicate with the protection agent on \<_ServerName_>.|Restart the DPM Replication Agent (DPMRA) service on \<_ServerName_>.|
|53|DPM failed to communicate with \<_ServerName_> because of a communication error with the protection agent.|<br/>1. Make sure that \<_ServerName_> is remotely accessible from the DPM server.<br/>2. If a firewall is enabled on \<*ServerName*>, make sure that it is not blocking requests from the DPM server.<br/>3. Restart the DPM Replication Agent service on \<*ServerName*>. If the service does not start, reinstall the protection agent.|
|55|The protected volume \<_VolumeName_> on \<_ServerName_> could not be accessed. The volume might have been removed or dismounted, or another process might be exclusively using it.|To resolve this error, make sure that volume \<_VolumeName_> can be accessed.<br/><br/>If a new volume \<*VolumeName*> was created to replace a previously protected volume with the same name, and you want to protect the new volume, you must remove the original volume from its protection group, and then add the new volume to the protection group. You can retain the replica for future recoveries.<br/><br/>If you no longer want to protect any data sources on the computer, you can uninstall the protection agent from the computer. If the volume has been permanently removed or deleted, remove the volume from its protection group (optionally choosing to retain the replica for future recoveries), and then inactivate the alert by clicking **Inactive alert**.|
|56|DPM failed to move data because it did not receive the completion status from the protection agent.|Retry the operation.|
|57|DPM cannot continue to protect the data on \<_TargetServerName_> because there is not enough disk space available on one or more of its volumes.|Free up disk space and retry.|
|58|DPM is out of disk space for the replica.|Make sure that there are no pending disk threshold alerts active for this data source, and then rerun the job. DPM might have automatically grown the volume and resolved the alerts.|
|59|DPM was used to initiate the recovery for \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_>. After this operation is complete, DPM must synchronize its replica with the data recovered on the protected computer in order to continue protection. The replica is being marked inconsistent to enable DPM to run a consistency check to synchronize the replica.|No action required.|
|60|The protection agent on \<_ServerName_> was temporarily unable to respond because it was in an unexpected state.|Retry the operation. If the problem remains it may be because there is an open file on the server being protected. In this scenario there are three potential workarounds:<br/><br/>1. Stop the Application and then manually run the DPM replica or Consistency Checks.<br/><br/>2. Develop a process that copies the data to be protected to a separate folder, then configure DPM to protect that folder.<br/><br/>3. Configure pre and post backup scripts on the protected server that utilize .CMD batch files to stop the application that is holding the file open, then let the DPM backup run, then restart the application after the backup is complete. This option means that the application will be unavailable during the time that the backup is running. For more information on pre and post scripting, see [Using Pre-Backup and Post-Backup Scripts](/previous-versions/system-center/data-protection-manager-2007/bb808870(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).|
|62|Cannot find the volume \<_VolumeName_> on the computer running DPM.|Make sure that the storage pool disk is accessible. If it is not, reallocate disk space, and then reprotect the data.|
|63|DPM cannot protect \<_FileName_> because there is no virtual name configured for the Resource Group to which the file belongs.|Make sure that the Resource Group has a virtual name configured. Also, check that the dependencies between cluster resources are configured correctly.|
|64|Volume \<_VolumeName_> is offline on the DPM server.|On the DPM server, open Server Manager, expand **Diagnostics**, expand **Event Viewer**, expand **Windows Logs**, and then take the recommended action in the Application log.|
|65|The DPM service was unable to communicate with the protection agent on \<_ServerName_>.|Restart the DPM Replication Agent service on the server.|
|77|The consistency check job failed due to an internal error.|Rerun the consistency check job.|
|78|DPM is unable to continue protection for data sources on the protected computer \<_ServerName_> because DPM has detected an incompatible filter installed on this computer.|To resolve this error, see [Incompatible filter driver errors](/previous-versions/system-center/data-protection-manager-2010/ff399635(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).|
|91|The replica of \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> is not consistent with the protected data source.|No action required.|
|92|Cannot access volume on the replica of \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_>.|Stop protection of \<_DatasourceName_>, and then reconfigure protection for this data source.|
|93|The replica of \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> is being created.|If the replica creation is scheduled for a later time, no action is required. If you have chosen to manually create the replica, copy the data, and then synchronize with consistency check.|
|94|The data source \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> is no longer protected, and DPM no longer has a replica of it. The replica was probably deleted because the Stop Protection without retaining replica task was run for this data source.|Wait for the replica creation operation to complete. Then, retry the job. No action is required. Wait for the DPM database to be updated to reflect that this data source is no longer protected.|
|95|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing synchronization operation.|Cancel the ongoing synchronization operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
|96|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing replica creation.|Cancel the consistency check operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|97|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing consistency check operation.|Cancel the consistency check operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|98|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by a recovery operation currently in progress.|Cancel the recovery operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|99|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing stop-protection job.|Cancel the stop-protection operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|100|Job failure on replica of \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing recovery point creation.|Cancel the recovery point operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
  
## Error codes 101-200

|Error Code|Message|Additional Information|
|---|---|---|
|101|The job failed because the replica for this data source is being deleted, probably because the Stop Protection without retaining replica task was run for this data source.|No action is required. Wait for the DPM database to update to reflect that this data source is no longer protected.|
|104|An unexpected error occurred while the job was running.<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>Unknown error (0x80041010)|This error can appear if you are trying to protect a SQL Server database that has files on a remote share. This is not supported by DPM.<br/><br/>This can also occur if you are attempting to back up a Hyper-V VM on a host running Windows Server 2012 R2. DPM 2012 SP1 does not support this scenario. To back up a Hyper-V VM on a host running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, upgrade DPM 2012 SP1 to DPM 2012 R2.|
|107|The DPM protection agent is no longer tracking changes on \<_PSVolumeName_> on \<_PSServerName_>.|<br/>1. Check recent records from the FSRecord source in the System Event log on \<_PSServerName_> to find out why the problem occurred.<br/>2. Synchronize with consistency check.|
|109|The replica on the DPM server for \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> is inconsistent with the protected data source. Changes cannot be applied.|No action required.|
|111| \<_ServerName_> has been restarted without being properly shut down.|No action required.|
|112|Changes for \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> cannot be applied to \<_FileName_>.|No action required.|
|113|Job failure for \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing conflicting operation on \<_ServerName_>.|Cancel the ongoing operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|114|Job failure on \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by ongoing backup operation.|Cancel the operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
|115|Job failure on \<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> was caused by ongoing recovery from tape operation.|Cancel the operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
|116|Job failure on \<_ServerName_> was caused by other ongoing conflicting operations on that computer. Some applications do not allow parallel recovery and backup operations on the same data source.|Cancel the operations, or wait for them to complete. Then retry the operation.|
|117|The synchronization job failed due to an internal error.|<br/>- For SQL Server, Exchange, or Windows SharePoint Services data, create a recovery point, enable short-term disk protection, and select Create a recovery point by using express full backup. <br/>- For other types of data, create a recovery point, and then select Create a recovery point after synchronizing. |
|118|The selected data cannot be recovered to the DPM server \<_ServerName_> because the replica is not in the Replica creation pending state.|Make sure that the replica is in Replica creation pending state before recovering.|
|130|You cannot add more recovery points because the maximum number of recovery points for the entire retention range is \<_MaxLimit_>.|To increase the recovery points per day, you must either decrease the retention range or select fewer days of week.|
|131|File name extensions must begin with a `.` and cannot contain any of the following characters: `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`|No action required.|
|132|Remove duplicate file name extensions.|Remove the extensions.|
|133|You cannot choose this recovery point because the time difference between it and a previous recovery point is less than your specified synchronization frequency.<br/><br/>Specified synchronization frequency: \<_ValueEntered_>|Choose a recovery point that has a time difference with a previous recovery point that is equal to or greater than the specified synchronization frequency.|
|135|Cannot protect this folder because data on other mount points of this volume have been selected for protection.|No action required.|
|136|Unable to create protection group because no disks or tape libraries available.|Configure a tape library or add a disk to the storage pool.|
|137|The protection group name entered already exists.|Specify a different name.|
|138|You have enabled protection of data on the system volume \<_ObjectName_>. If you also want to protect the system state of this computer, you must add the System State as a member of the protection group separately.|No action required.|
|140|The network bandwidth usage throttling rate must be between 1 Mbps and 10000 Mbps.|Specify a valid value.|
|141|Cannot perform <_InputParameterTag_> because the replica is not idle.|Wait for the ongoing job to complete or cancel the job.|
|143|If you use DPM to protect data on NETLOGON or SYSVOL shares on a domain controller, restoring the data using DPM will corrupt the domain controller's copy of the Active Directory Domain Services database.|No action required.|
|144|The backup frequency for long-term protection needs to be equal to or greater than the backup frequency for short-term protection.<br/><br/>Back up frequency for short-term protection: \<_InputParameterTag_>|No action required.|
|145|You cannot reduce the express full backup schedule because this would affect the long-term recovery goals of this protection group.|Before you can reduce the express full backup schedule of this protection group, you must modify the protection group properties to specify a backup frequency that is equal to or greater than weekly.|
|146|The specified protection group name is not valid. A protection group name must be between 1 and 64 characters, with at least one alphabet letter.|Specify a valid name.|
|147|To view the protected computers, you need to enable protection of these computers.|Enable protection.|
|148|You have chosen to protect replicas on another DPM server (primary DPM server).|We recommend that you protect the DPM database (DPMDB) of the primary DPM server along with the replicas. Without protecting the DPMDB, you will not be able to recover the replicas of the primary DPM server in case of a disaster where the DPMDB and the replicas are lost.|
|149|You have specified the change journal size on volume \<_VolumeName_> for \<_ServerName_> to be set to \<_ValueEntered_>. However, this is greater than the available space on the selected computer.|Free space on the volume on the protected computer, and then retry the task.|
|150|You are trying to protect replicas on a primary DPM server.<br/><br/>File exclusions will not apply to these replicas, but they will apply to all other protection group members.|No action required.|
|151|The size and used disk space information for <_VolumeName_> on <_ServerName_> could not be retrieved. Disk space cannot be allocated to protect data on this volume until this information is retrieved. Do you want to retry?|Retry the action.|
|152|DPM data source cannot be added to the protection group because of existing settings.|Create a new protection group.|
|156|The ability to add members to this protection group is temporarily disabled while initial synchronization of one or more members occurs.|Either cancel the initial synchronization jobs for the members or wait until they complete.|
|157| `DatasourceName` cannot be added to protection because it is already a member of a protection group.|No action required.|
|158| _ValueEntered_ isn't a valid value. The maximum is _MaximumSizeUnit_.|Specify a valid value.|
|159| \<_ValueEntered_> isn't a valid value.|Specify a valid value.|
|160|\<_ValueEntered_> doesn't meet the minimum allocation value of \<**OriginallyCalculatedValue**> \<**Unit**>.|Specify a valid value.|
|162|DPM can optimize its disk allocation recommendation by calculating the size of the selected data on _VolumeName_ on _ServerName_. Do you want to proceed?|Proceed to optimize.|
|164| \<_VolumeName_> on \<_ServerName_> does not meet the minimum size requirement of 1 GB.|Don't select the volume.|
|168|The replicas for one or more of the volumes being protected are missing. This may be a result of one or more disks in the DPM storage pool being offline or the deletion of volumes created by DPM to store the replicas. You cannot modify disk allocation or configure protection for any members on these volumes until the replicas have been reallocated.|Select **Review Pending Members** in the protection group, and allocate disk space for protection.|
|169|Although you chose to retain the replica for this previously protected volume, the replica is now missing from the DPM server. Either the volume used to store the replica has been deleted from the storage pool, or the disk on which the replica was stored cannot be detected. You cannot protect this previously protected volume until you delete the record of this replica from DPM.|Select the relevant member in the protection group and click **Remove inactive protection**. Make sure that the setting **Delete replica on disk** is selected.|
|171|There is insufficient space on the storage pool disks to allocate the replica and recovery point volumes.|This error can occur when you attempt to stop bare metal recovery (BMR) for a protection group. By default, when you stop only BMR, DPM tries to convert BMR protection to System State protection, which requires more space for system backup than BMR. If available space is not sufficient to convert to System State protection, you will receive this error.<br/><br/>If you stop BMR protection to gain more disk space, select **Stop protection of member for both Bare Metal Recovery and System State.|
|172|The inputs are not valid for custom scheme.|No action required.|
|173|You cannot protect the selected database now. This database is already selected for protection as part of Windows SharePoint Services protection to which the database belongs.|If you want to protect only this database, then you have to remove the Windows SharePoint Services farm from protection.|
|174|You cannot protect the selected Windows SharePoint Services data now. Some of the databases that are components of the Windows SharePoint Services farm have already been selected for protection.|If you want to protect this Windows SharePoint Services data, then you have to remove the databases from protection.|
|175|Existing volumes do not meet the size requirements for replica and recovery point volumes for \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_>.|Either use the DPM storage pool disks for protection or create volumes that are adequately sized. DPM will not use any volumes in which either operating systems or DPM components are installed.|
|176|DPM failed to use the volume \<_VolumeLabel_> to create the replica because it is not adequately sized.|Volumes to be used for the replica should be greater than \<_MinimumSize_> GB.|
|177|DPM failed to use the volume \<_VolumeLabel_> to create the recovery point volume because it is not adequately sized.|Volumes to be used for storing recovery points should be greater than \<_MinimumSize_> GB.|
|178|DPM failed to use volume \<_VolumeLabel_> since this has already been selected to protect \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_>.|No action required.|
|179|DPM cannot resize volumes \<_VolumeLabel_> and \<_VolumeLabel_>, which are being used to protect \<_DatasourceType_>\<_DatasourceName_> on \<_ServerName_> because these are custom volumes.|Use Disk Management to resize your volumes.|
|180|Failure to allocate disk space to the storage pool for storing the replica and the recovery points for \<_VolumeName_> on \<_ServerName_>. No protection will be initiated for \<_VolumeName_> on \<_ServerName_> until disk space has been allocated to the storage pool.|Select **Review Pending Members** for a protection group, and allocate disk space for protection.|
|181|DPM could not create \<_ProtectedGroup_> because of failed disk allocations.|Refer to the allocation errors listed below, and then try to create the protection group again.|
|182|Eseutil consistency check cannot be performed for this protection group, because Eseutil.exe is not present on the DPM server.|Copy the Ese.dll and Eseutil.exe files from the Exchange Server installation folder to \<_FolderPath_> on the DPM server.<br/><br/>You can also choose not to run an Eseutil consistency check for this protection group by clearing the Run Eseutil Consistency check option. However, we do not recommend this because it does not make sure of the recoverability of the protected data.|
|183|Select a single item for creating a recovery point on disk. You have currently selected multiple items in the list view.|No action required.|
|184|Cannot create a recovery point for the application data source because protection is stopped.|No action required.|
|185|There was a failure during recovery point consolidation.|Locate the relevant alert and resolve the issue. Then retry recovery.|
|192|The requested operation could not be completed because the replica was in an inconsistent state.|Run a consistency check, and then retry the operation.|
|195|Your changes cannot be applied because the protection group properties have changed. The protection group properties could have changed due to either of the following reasons:<br/>- An auto discovery job ran and modified the properties of this protection group.<br/>- Another user is using DPM Administrator Console to modify the properties of this protection group.|Retry the operation.|
|199|DPM was unable to protect the members in the resource group \<_ObjectName_>. This resource group contains resources that have dependencies that are not part of this resource group.|<br/>1. Check your cluster configuration to make sure that the shares and the hard disks on which the shares reside are part of the same resource group.<br/>2. Check your cluster configuration to make sure that the application and the hard disks that it requires are part of the same resource group.|
|200|DPM could not perform the requested action on the selected items. This might be because one or more of the selected items or a property associated with the selected items has changed, which prevents the requested action.|Retry the operation.|

|Error Code|Message|Additional Information|
|---|---|---|
|2000|DPM failed to run the operation because another conflicting operation is in progress.|Retry the operation later.|
|2009|DPM protection agent on \<_AgentTargetServer_> could not complete the operation due to insufficient resources on the computer.|To resolve this error, do the following:<br/>1. For computers that are running Windows Server 2003, make sure that KB [942486](https://support.microsoft.com/help/942486) is installed.<br/>2. Make sure that the page file size is set correctly. For additional information on page file size requirements, go to [DPM and Memory](/previous-versions/system-center/data-protection-manager-2010/ff399244(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN).<br/>3. For 32-bit computers other than those hosting Exchange Server 2003, make sure that the `/3GB` switch is not set in the boot.ini file.<br/>4. If the protected volume is highly fragmented, run Disk Defragmenter on the volume, and then run a consistency check.<br/>5. Create the registry key `ForceFixup` under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\Agents\2.0` with a value of **1**, and then retry the operation.<br/>|
