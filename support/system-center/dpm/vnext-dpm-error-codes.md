|44|RmFsCaseSensitive||
|45|DPM failed to communicate with the protection agent on <_ServerName_> because the agent isn't installed or the computer is restarting.|Install the protection agent. If the computer is in the process of restarting, allow some time for the computer to come online.|
|46|DPM failed to perform the operation because too many objects are selected. Select fewer objects, and then retry the operation.|<ul><li>If you're trying to protect a large number of data sources on a volume, consider protecting the whole volume instead of individual data sources.</li> <li> If you're trying to recover a large number of folders or files from a volume, consider recovering the parent folder, or divide the recovery into multiple operations.|
|47|Some components of the protection agent on <_PSServerName_> weren't installed or configured properly.|<br/>1. Verify that the targeted computer <*PSServerName*> isn't running an unsupported version of the operating system. <br/>2. Restart the computer <*PSServerName*>. If the problem persists, on <*PSServerName*>, uninstall the DPM protection agent by using **Add or Remove Programs**. Then, on the DPM server, in the **Management** task area on the **Agents** tab, reinstall the protection agent on <*PSServerName*>.|
|48| <_ServerName_> needs to be restarted. It might be because the computer hasn't been restarted since the protection agent was installed.|Restart the server. If you have protected data on this server, synchronize the data by performing a consistency check after the restart.|
|49|The protection agent timed out while trying to access the file <_FileName_> for volume *\<PSVolumeName>* on <_PSServerName_>.|Make sure that the file is accessible. Synchronize the data with a consistency check.|
|50|The DPM protection agent on <_PSServerName_> failed to perform a consistency check for file <_FileName_> on volume *\<PSVolumeName>*.|Make sure that the file is available and rerun the consistency check.|
|51|Root directories were added to or removed from protection for volume *\<PSVolumeName>* on <_PSServerName_>.|No action required.|
|52|The DPM service was unable to communicate with the protection agent on <_ServerName_>.|Restart the DPM Replication Agent (DPMRA) service on <*ServerName*>.|
|53|DPM failed to communicate with <_ServerName_> because of a communication error with the protection agent.|<br/>1. Make sure that <*ServerName*> is remotely accessible from the DPM server.<br/>2. If a firewall is enabled on <*ServerName*>, make sure that it's not blocking requests from the DPM server.<br/>3. Restart the DPM Replication Agent service on <*ServerName*>. If the service doesn't start, reinstall the protection agent.|
|54|RmFSFInsufficientResources| |
|55|The protected volume *\<VolumeName>* on <_ServerName_> couldn't be accessed. The volume might have been removed or dismounted, or another process might be exclusively using it.|To resolve this error, make sure that volume *\<VolumeName>* can be accessed. <br/><br/>If a new volume *\<VolumeName>* was created to replace a previously protected volume with the same name, and you want to protect the new volume, you must remove the original volume from its protection group, and then add the new volume to the protection group. You can retain the replica for future recoveries. <br/><br/>If you no longer want to protect any data sources on the computer, you can uninstall the protection agent from the computer. If the volume has been permanently removed or deleted, remove the volume from its protection group (optionally choosing to retain the replica for future recoveries), and then inactivate the alert by selecting **Inactive alert**.|
|56|DPM failed to move data because it didn't receive the completion status from the protection agent.|Retry the operation.|
|57|DPM can't continue to protect the data on *\<_TargetServerName_>* because there is not enough disk space available on one or more of its volumes.|Free up disk space and retry.|
|58|DPM is out of disk space for the replica.|Make sure that there are no pending disk threshold alerts active for this data source, and then rerun the job. DPM might have automatically grown the volume and resolved the alerts.|
|59|DPM was used to initiate the recovery for <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_>. After this operation is complete, DPM must synchronize its replica with the data recovered on the protected computer in order to continue protection. The replica is being marked inconsistent to enable DPM to run a consistency check to synchronize the replica.|No action required.|
|60|The protection agent on <_ServerName_> was temporarily unable to respond because it was in an unexpected state.|Retry the operation. If the problem remains, it may be because there's an open file on the server being protected. In this scenario, there are four potential workarounds: <ul><li>Stop the application and then manually run the DPM replica or consistency checks. </li> <li>Develop a process that copies the data to be protected to a separate folder, and then configure DPM to protect that folder. </li> <li>Configure pre-backup and post-backup scripts on the protected server that utilize .cmd batch files to stop the application that's holding the file open, let the DPM backup run, and then restart the application after the backup is complete. This option means that the application will be unavailable during the time that the backup is running.</li> <li>Add the **CommandTimeout** DWORD registry entry that has a value of **1b7740** to the following registry subkey: <br>`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\Agent` </li></ul>|
|61|RmFileMovedIn| |
|62|Cannot find the volume *\<VolumeName>* on the computer running DPM.|Make sure that the storage pool disk is accessible. If it isn't, reallocate disk space, and then reprotect the data.|
|63|DPM can't protect <_FileName_> because there is no virtual name configured for the Resource Group to which the file belongs.|Make sure that the Resource Group has a virtual name configured. Also, check that the dependencies between cluster resources are configured correctly.|
|64|Volume *\<VolumeName>* is offline on the DPM server.|On the DPM server, open Server Manager, expand **Diagnostics** > **Event Viewer** > **Windows Logs**, and then take the recommended action in the Application log.|
|65|The DPM service was unable to communicate with the protection agent on <_ServerName_>.|Restart the DPM Replication Agent service on the server.|
|77|The consistency check job failed due to an internal error.|Rerun the consistency check job.|
|78|DPM is unable to continue protection for data sources on the protected computer <_ServerName_> because DPM has detected an incompatible filter installed on this computer.|To resolve, see [Incompatible filter driver errors](/previous-versions/system-center/data-protection-manager-2010/ff399635(v=technet.10)).|
|91|The replica of <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> isn't consistent with the protected data source.|No action required.|
|92|Can't access volume on the replica of <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_>.|Stop protection of <*DatasourceName*>, and then reconfigure protection for this data source.|
|93|The replica of <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> is being created.|If the replica creation is scheduled for a later time, no action is required. If you have chosen to manually create the replica, copy the data, and then synchronize with consistency check.|
|94|The data source <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> is no longer protected, and DPM no longer has a replica of it. The replica was probably deleted because the **Stop Protection without retaining replica** task was run for this data source.|Wait for the replica creation operation to complete. Then, retry the job. No action is required. Wait for the DPM database to be updated to reflect that this data source is no longer protected.|
|95|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing synchronization operation.|Cancel the ongoing synchronization operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
|96|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing replica creation.|Cancel the consistency check operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|97|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing consistency check operation.|Wait for the ongoing consistency check operation to complete. Then retry the job.|
|98|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by a recovery operation currently in progress.|Cancel the recovery operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|99|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing stop-protection job.|Cancel the stop-protection operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the job.|
|100|Job failure on replica of <_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> was caused by an ongoing recovery point creation.|Cancel the recovery point operation, or wait for it to complete. Then retry the operation.|
  
## Error codes 101-200

|145|You can't reduce the express full backup schedule because it would affect the long-term recovery goals of this protection group.|Before you can reduce the express full backup schedule of this protection group, you must modify the protection group properties to specify a backup frequency that is equal to or greater than weekly.|
|146|The specified protection group name isn't valid. A protection group name must be between 1 and 64 characters, with at least one alphabet letter.|Specify a valid name.|
|147|To view the protected computers, you need to enable protection of these computers.|Enable protection.|
|148|You have chosen to protect replicas on another DPM server (primary DPM server).|We recommend that you protect the DPM database (DPMDB) of the primary DPM server along with the replicas. Without protecting the DPMDB, you won't be able to recover the replicas of the primary DPM server in case of a disaster where the DPMDB and the replicas are lost.|
|149|You have specified the change journal size on volume *\<VolumeName>* for <_ServerName_> to be set to *\<ValueEntered>*. However, it's greater than the available space on the selected computer.|Free space on the volume on the protected computer, and then retry the task.|
|150|You are trying to protect replicas on a primary DPM server.<br/><br/>File exclusions won't apply to these replicas, but they'll apply to all other protection group members.|No action required.|
|151|The size and used disk space information for *\<VolumeName>* on <_ServerName_> couldn't be retrieved. Disk space can't be allocated to protect data on this volume until this information is retrieved. Do you want to retry?|Retry the action.|
|152|DPM data source can't be added to the protection group because of existing settings.|Create a new protection group.|

|159| *\<ValueEntered>* isn't a valid value.|Specify a valid value.|
|160|*\<ValueEntered>* doesn't meet the minimum allocation value of *\<OriginallyCalculatedValue>\<Unit>*.|Specify a valid value.|
|162|DPM can optimize its disk allocation recommendation by calculating the size of the selected data on *\<VolumeName>* on <_ServerName_>. Do you want to proceed?|Proceed to optimize.|
|164| *\<VolumeName>* on <_ServerName_> doesn't meet the minimum size requirement of 1 GB.|Don't select the volume.|
|168|The replicas for one or more of the volumes being protected are missing. It may be a result of one or more disks in the DPM storage pool being offline or the deletion of volumes created by DPM to store the replicas. You cannot modify disk allocation or configure protection for any members on these volumes until the replicas have been reallocated.|Select **Review Pending Members** in the protection group, and allocate disk space for protection.|
|169|Although you chose to retain the replica for this previously protected volume, the replica is now missing from the DPM server. Either the volume used to store the replica has been deleted from the storage pool, or the disk on which the replica was stored cannot be detected. You can't protect this previously protected volume until you delete the record of this replica from DPM.|Select the relevant member in the protection group and select **Remove inactive protection**. Make sure that **Delete replica on disk** is selected.|
|170|The requested changes to the protection group *\<ProtectedGroup>* will initiate an immediate consistency check on the following: *\<ListOfVolumes>*. <br/><br/>Do you want to apply the requested changes?| |
|171|There is insufficient space on the storage pool disks to allocate the replica and recovery point volumes.|This error can occur when you attempt to stop bare metal recovery (BMR) for a protection group. By default, when you stop only BMR, DPM tries to convert BMR protection to System State protection, which requires more space for system backup than BMR. If available space isn't sufficient to convert to System State protection, you'll receive this error. <br/><br/>If you stop BMR protection to gain more disk space, select Stop protection of member for both **Bare Metal Recovery** and **System State**. |
|172|The inputs aren't valid for custom scheme.|No action required.|
|173|You can't protect the selected database now. This database is already selected for protection as part of Windows SharePoint Services protection to which the database belongs.|If you want to protect only this database, then you have to remove the Windows SharePoint Services farm from protection.|
|174|You cannot protect the selected Windows SharePoint Services data now. Some of the databases which are components of the Windows SharePoint Services farm have already been selected for protection.|If you want to protect this Windows SharePoint Services data, you have to remove the databases from protection.|
|175|Existing volumes do not meet the size requirements for replica and recovery point volumes for <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_>.|Either use the DPM storage pool disks for protection or create volumes that are adequately sized. DPM won't use any volumes in which either operating system or DPM component is installed.|
|176|DPM failed to use the volume <_VolumeLabel_> to create the replica because it is not adequately sized.|Volumes to be used for the replica should be greater than <_MinimumSize_> GB.|
|177|DPM failed to use the volume <_VolumeLabel_> to create the recovery point volume because it is not adequately sized.|Volumes to be used for storing recovery points should be greater than <_MinimumSize_> GB.|
|178|DPM failed to use volume <_VolumeLabel_> since this has already been selected to protect <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_>.|No action required.|
|179|DPM cannot resize volumes <_VolumeLabel_> and <*VolumeLabel*>, which are being used to protect <_DatasourceType_><_DatasourceName_> on <_ServerName_> because these are custom volumes.|Use Disk Management to resize your volumes.|
|180|Failure to allocate disk space to the storage pool for storing the replica and the recovery points for <_VolumeName_> on <_ServerName_>. No protection will be initiated for <*VolumeName*> on <*ServerName*> until disk space has been allocated to the storage pool.|Select **Review Pending Members** for a protection group, and allocate disk space for protection.|
|181|DPM could not create <_ProtectedGroup_> because of failed disk allocations.|Refer to the allocation errors listed below, and then try to create the protection group again.|
|182|Eseutil consistency check cannot be performed for this protection group, because Eseutil.exe is not present on the DPM server.|Copy the Ese.dll and Eseutil.exe files from the Exchange Server installation folder to <_FolderPath_> on the DPM server.<br/><br/>You can also choose not to run an Eseutil consistency check for this protection group by clearing the **Run Eseutil Consistency check** option. However, we don't recommend this because it doesn't make sure of the recoverability of the protected data.|
|183|Select a single item for creating a recovery point on disk. You have currently selected multiple items in the list view.|No action required.|
|184|Cannot create a recovery point for the application data source because protection is stopped.|No action required.|
|186|DPM cannot use the volumes <_VolumeLabel_> for disk allocation as they are already in use by DPM. Specify a volume that is unallocated or used by DPM.| |
|185|There was a failure during recovery point consolidation.|Locate the relevant alert and resolve the issue. Then retry recovery.|
|192|The requested operation could not be completed because the replica was in an inconsistent state.|Run a consistency check, and then retry the operation.|
|193|Data source does not exist.| |
|194|PGIDNotFound| |
|195|Your changes cannot be applied because the protection group properties have changed. The protection group properties could have changed due to either of the following reasons:<ul><li>An auto discovery job ran and modified the properties of this protection group.</li><li>Another user is using DPM Administrator Console to modify the properties of this protection group.</li></ul>|Retry the operation.|
|196|IntentTranslationInProgress| |
|197|InvalidProtectedGroupSpec| |
