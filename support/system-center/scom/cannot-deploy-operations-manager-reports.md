# Operations Manager reports fail to deploy

This article helps you fix an issue in which deploying Operations Manager reports fails with event ID 31567.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; System Center Operations Manager  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4519161

## Symptoms

When you install System Center 2019 Operations Manager together with the latest version of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2017, Operations Manager reports don't deploy.

When you open the **Reporting** view in the Operations console, and select any of the folders, the list of reports is empty. Additionally, error messages that resemble the following are logged in the Operations Manager event log:

> [!NOTE]
> This issue also occurs in System Center Operations Manager version 1807 when you upgrade to SSRS 2017, and then you remove and reinstall Operations Manager Reporting.

## Cause

SSRS 2017 version 14.0.600.1274 and later versions include a new advanced setting **AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload**. This setting restricts the set of extensions of resources files that can be uploaded to the report server. This issue occurs because Operations Manager Reporting uses extensions that aren't included in the default set in **AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload**.

## Resolution 1

Add `*.*` to the list of authorized extensions. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio, and then connect to a report server instance that Operations Manager uses.
2. Right-click the report server instance name, select **Properties**, and then select **Advanced**.
3. Locate the **AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload** setting, add `*.*` to the list of extensions, and then select **OK**.
4. Restart SSRS.

## Resolution 2

Use PowerShell script to add the extensions. To do this, run the following PowerShell script:

> [!NOTE]
> You need to restart SSRS after running this script.

```powershell
$ServiceAddress = 'http://localhost'

$ExtensionAdd = @(
	'*'
	'CustomConfiguration'
	'Report'
	'AvailabilityMonitor'
	'TopNApplications'
	'Settings'
	'License'
	'ServiceLevelTrackingSummary'
	'CustomPerformance'
	'MostCommonEvents'
	'PerformanceTop'
	'Detail'
	'DatabaseSettings'
	'ServiceLevelObjectiveDetail'

	'mp'
	'TopNErrorGroups'

	'TopNApplicationsGrowth'
	'DisplayStrings'
	'Space'
	'Override'
	'Performance'

$error.clear()
try
{
	$Uri = [System.Uri]"$ServiceAddress/ReportServer/ReportService2010.asmx"
	$Proxy = New-WebServiceProxy -Uri $Uri -UseDefaultCredential
	$Type = $Proxy.GetType().Namespace + '.Property'
	
	$Property = New-Object -TypeName $Type
	$Property.Name = 'AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload'

	$ValueAdd = $ExtensionAdd | ForEach-Object -Process {
		"*.$psItem"
	}	

	$Current = $Proxy.GetSystemProperties($Property)
	if ($Current)
    {
	$ValueCurrent = $Current.Value -split ','
	$ValueSet = $ValueCurrent + $ValueAdd | Sort-Object -Unique
	}
	else
    {
        $ValueSet = $ValueAdd | Sort-Object -Unique
    }

	
	$Property.Value = $ValueSet -join ','
	
	$Proxy.SetSystemProperties($Property)
    Write-Output '  Successfully set property to: *.*'
}
catch
{
	Write-Warning "Failure occurred: $error"
}
Write-Output 'Script completed!'
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may need to update the `$ServiceAddress` variable using a valid web address to your report service. The list of extensions in the script may not be exhaustive. Include your own extensions as appropriate.
