## Cause

This can occur for either of the following reasons:

- Certificates may not be valid as the reporting server may have been changed.
- The certificate contains an incorrect host name.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, complete the following steps:

1. Remove the existing contents of the agent directory on the server and reinstall the agent RPM.
1. Generate the certificate, making sure to use the correct host name:

   `/opt/Microsoft/scx/bin/tools/scssslconfig -f -h <hostname>`

1. Check the status of the certificate:

   ```console
   openssl x509 -noout -in /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/ssl/scx.pem -subject -issuer -dates
   ```

1. Discover the agent from the console and sign the invalid certificate without SSH.
