## Cause

The `DNS2008ComponentDiscovery.vbs` script could not connect to the WMI class `MicrosoftDNS_Zone` due to an unavailable property value in the class.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, recreate the WMI values for DNS by recompiling the DNS *.mof* files:

On the DNS server, open a Command Prompt as Administrator and execute the following commands:

```console
mofcomp C:\Windows\System32\wbem\dnsetw.mof
```

and

```console
mofcomp C:\Windows\System32\wbem\dnsprov.mof
```

These commands recreate the DNS information in the WMI repository. Once this is done, the errors should no longer appear.
