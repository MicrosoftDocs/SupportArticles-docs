## Cause

The error occurs because Microsoft.SystemCenter2012.ConfigurationManager.Discovery management pack version 5.0.8239.1009 is not upgrade-compatible with previous versions due to a design change.

## Resolution

To upgrade, remove (delete) the existing management pack (Microsoft.SystemCenter2012.ConfigurationManager.Discovery, version 5.0.7804.1000) that will not update, and then import the new one (Microsoft.SystemCenter2012.ConfigurationManager.Discovery, version 5.0.8239.1009).
