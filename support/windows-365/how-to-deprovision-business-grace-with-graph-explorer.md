# How to remove Windows 365 Business Cloud PCs from grace period using Graph Explorer and Microsoft Graph API

## Summary

When you remove a license from a user, Windows 365 Business Cloud PCs enter a grace period before permanent removal. In some cases, you might want to remove these Cloud PCs from grace manually, such as to reassign the license to another user.

This article provides step-by-step instructions for using Microsoft Graph Explorer and the Microsoft Graph API to perform this deprovision.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator access to your Microsoft 365 tenant

- Permissions to use Microsoft Graph API (Cloud PC administrator or equivalent)

- Access to Microsoft Graph Explorer

- Cloud PCs in `inGracePeriod` status in your Windows 365 environment

## Step 1: Sign in to Graph Explorer

1.  Go to [Graph Explorer \| Try Microsoft Graph APIs - Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer)

1.  Select **Sign in to Graph Explorer** (top right corner).

1.  Authenticate by using your administrator credentials and set the tenant.

## Step 2: Identify Cloud PCs in grace period

1.  In the query box, set the following **GET** request:

> https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/cloudPCs?\$filter=status eq 'inGracePeriod'

1.  In Graph Explorer, select **Modify Permissions**.

1.  Consent to the following permissions for your session:

- CloudPC.Read.All

- CloudPC.ReadWrite.All

1.  If not already granted, select **Consent** to add these permissions.

1.  Select **Run Query**.

1.  Review the results to locate the Cloud PCs you want to remove. Note the **id** value for each relevant Cloud PC.

## Step 3: Remove a Cloud PC from grace

1.  For each Cloud PC, send a **POST** request to remove it from grace. In the query box, select **POST** and use the following request:

> https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/cloudPCs/{cloudPCId}/endGracePeriod

1.  Replace `{cloudPCId}` with the actual ID of the Cloud PC. For example:

> https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/virtualEndpoint/cloudPCs/4b18de4b-ab05-4059-8c61-0323a7df4ced/endGracePeriod

1.  Leave the request body empty.

1.  Select **Run Query**.

1.  If successful, you receive a **No Content - 204** response.

## Step 4: Verify removal

1.  To confirm removal from grace, repeat the **GET** request from Step 3.

1.  The Cloud PC shouldn't appear with status eq 'inGracePeriod'.

## Troubleshooting and notes

- If you receive a permissions error, verify that you have the correct roles and all necessary permissions are consented.

- Changes made through the Graph API might take a few minutes to reflect in the Windows 365 portal.

- Removing a Cloud PC from grace permanently deletes the Cloud PC and any associated user data.
