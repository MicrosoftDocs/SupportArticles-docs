# Windows 365 BCDR known issues

This article addresses a known issue that's related to Windows 365 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) scenarios.

## Classic Outlook is corrupted after disaster recovery failover or failback

After you restore a Cloud PC from a snapshot during a disaster recovery failover or upon failing back to the primary region after the disaster, users might encounter an error message when they start classic Outlook.

This issue occurs because the Outlook offline cache becomes corrupted because the client and the server become out of sync during a failover. The client on the snapshot reflects a past state relative to the server's current status. The process of re-synchronizing the Offline Storage Table (OST) file can take time.

This process does not cause any data loss.

### Workaround

After you complete a failover or failback operation, delete the Cloud PC's OST file.

This action forces Outlook to rebuild the search index and the offline cache of the mailbox. This process does not cause any data loss.

### Resolution

Use the new Outlook app. The new Outlook app uses a different caching mechanism that eliminates this synchronization issue.
