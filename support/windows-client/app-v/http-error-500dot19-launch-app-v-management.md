# HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error when launching the App-V Management console

This article provides a solution to an issue where launching the App-V 5.0 Management console that's installed on a drive other than the C: drive fails.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2800730

## Symptoms

When the App-V 5.0 Management console is installed on a drive other than the C: drive, launching the console may fail and generate the following error message:

> HTTP Error 500.19 - Internal Server Error  
Module IIS Web Core  
Notification Unknown  
Handler Not yet determined  
Error Code 0x80070005  
Config Error Cannot read configuration file due to insufficient permissions  
Config File \\\\?\\E:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Application Virtualization Server\\ManagementService\\web.config

## Cause

This occurs due to invalid NTFS permissions on the drive hosting the App-V 5.0 Management Service INSTALLDIR directory.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, give the local computers Users group Read & execute, List folder contents and Read permissions to the root of the drive the hosts the App-V Management consoles INSTALLDIR directory. The INSTALLDIR parameter can be found referencing the following registry key:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AppV\Server\ManagementService`

The local computer User group contains the following users by default:

- Local Administrator Account
- NT AUTHORITY\\Authenticated users (S-1-5-11)
- NT AUTHORITY\\INTERACTIVE (S-1-5-4)
- Domain\\Domain users

After updating the permissions on the drive that hosts the INSTALLDIR directory, either stop and start the Microsoft App-V Management Service website in IIS or issue an IISRESET.

## More information

Process Monitor can be used to troubleshoot these types of issues.

For more information, see [Process Monitor v3.60](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon).
