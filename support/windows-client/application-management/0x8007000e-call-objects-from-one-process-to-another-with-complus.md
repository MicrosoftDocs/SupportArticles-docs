# Error when you call many objects from one process to another by using COM+: Not enough storage is available to complete this operation (0x8007000e)

This article provides a solution to an issue where calling many objects from one process to another by using Microsoft COM+ fails.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 890425

## Symptoms

When you call many objects from one process to another by using Microsoft COM+, you may receive the following error message:

> Not enough storage is available to complete this operation (0x8007000e)

If you attach a debugger to the client process, you may see 8007000E first chance exceptions reported by the debugger.

## Cause

This problem is caused by the limitation in the remote procedure call (RPC) layer where only 256 unique interfaces can be called from one process to another. This problem typically occurs when you use COM+ or Microsoft Transaction Server with many objects in the program or package.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods:

- Split objects between multiple processes.
- Reduce the number of interfaces that are called between one process and another.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed at the beginning of this article.
