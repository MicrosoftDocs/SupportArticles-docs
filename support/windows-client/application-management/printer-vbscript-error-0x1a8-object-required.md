## Resolution

- Use REGSVR32.EXE located in the %windir%\syswow64 folder to register PRNADMIN.DLL.

    ```console
    %windir%\syswow64\regsvr32.exe PRNADMIN.DLL
    ```

- Use CSCRIPT.EXE located in the %windir%\syswow64 folder to run the script:

    ```console
    %windir%\syswow64\cscript.exe <vbscript>
    ```
