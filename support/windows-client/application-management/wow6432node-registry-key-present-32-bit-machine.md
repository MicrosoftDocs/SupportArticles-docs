# Registry key WOW6432Node may be listed in system registry in 32 bit (x86) version of Windows 7

This article fixes an issue in which a registry subkey labeled Wow6432Node is listed in system registry on x86 machines.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2582176

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- A computer running 32 Bit (x86) Platform of Windows 7.
- Install Windows 7 with SP1 or install Windows 7 RTM Upgraded to SP1.
- Click the **Start** button, type *regedit* in the search box to open the Registry Editor.
- Expand the following registry key:

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE`

In this scenario, you may notice a registry subkey labeled **Wow6432Node** and feel that the system may have been incorrectly installed or upgraded.

## Cause

This registry key is typically used for 32-bit applications on 64-bit machines. If they're present on x86 machines, they don't cause any issues as they aren't used.

## Resolution

You can safely ignore the registry value.

## How to determine Windows 7 platform

There are a number of tools that you can use to identify which platform is installed on the system. Below are two ways that you can use to help identify the platform

### Method 1: Use System Information Tool to view Processor Architecture

1. Click on the **Start** button.
2. In the **Search** box, type the command `MSINFO32` without the quotes.
3. In the left-hand pane, click **System Summary**.
4. In the right-hand pane, view the entry labeled **System Type**.

    If the entry states **x86-Based PC**, this is 32-bit platform. If the entry states **x64-Based PC**, this is 64-bit platform.

### Method 2: Use the Set command to display Processor Architecture

1. Open an Administrative command prompt
2. Type the following command:

    ```console
    set processor_architecture
    ```

    If the result is **PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE=x86**, this is 32-bit platform. If the result is **PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE=AMD64** this is 64-bit platform.
