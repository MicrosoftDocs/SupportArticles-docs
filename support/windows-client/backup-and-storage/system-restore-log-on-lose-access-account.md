- Scenario 1: You recently set a new password for the protected administrator account. However, you don't remember the password.
- Scenario 2: You type the correct logon password. However, Windows Vista or Windows 7 does not accept the password because the system is corrupted.
- Scenario 3: You delete a protected administrator account. Now, you can't log on to another administrator account.
- Scenario 4: You change a protected administrator account to a standard user account. Now, you can't log on to another administrator account.
