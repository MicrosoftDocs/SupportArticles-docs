# Activation failures and (not genuine) notifications around January 8, 2019, on volume-licensed Windows 7 Service Pack 1 KMS clients

This article provides a solution to an issue where users may receive the Windows Activation or "Windows is not genuine" notifications starting at or after 10:00 UTC, January 8, 2019.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4487266

## Summary

This article applies to volume-licensed Windows 7 Service Pack 1 devices that use Key Management Service (KMS) activation and have the [KB 971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) update installed. Some users may receive the Windows Activation or "Windows is not genuine" notifications starting at or after 10:00 UTC, January 8, 2019.

On January 9, 2019, we reverted a change that was made to Microsoft Activation and Validation servers. For devices that continue to report activation and "not genuine" notifications, you should remove [KB 971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) by following the steps in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.

Windows editions that support volume-licensing activation include the following:

- Windows 7 Professional
- Windows 7 Professional N
- Windows 7 Professional E
- Windows 7 Enterprise
- Windows 7 Enterprise N
- Windows 7 Enterprise E

For Windows editions that experience activation and "not genuine" errors that are not caused by the Microsoft Activation and Validation server change around January 8, 2019, we recommend that you follow standard activation troubleshooting.

## Symptoms

1. You receive a **Windows is not genuine** error message after you log on.

## Cause

A recent update to the Microsoft Activation and Validation unintentionally caused a "not genuine" error on volume-licensed Windows 7 clients that had [KB971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) installed. The change was introduced at 10:00:00 UTC on January 8, 2019, and was reverted at 4:30:00 UTC on January 9, 2019.

> [!NOTE]
> This timing coincides with the release of the "1B" January 2019 updates ([KB 4480960](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4480960) and [KB 4480970](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4480970)) that were released on Tuesday, January 8, 2019. These events are not related.

Windows 7 devices that have [KB971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) installed but did not experience this issue between the time of the change (10:00:00 UTC, January 8, 2019) and the time of the reversion of that change (4:30:00 UTC, January 9, 2019)  should not experience the issue that is described in this article.

[KB971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) contains the following text:

"Note For an Enterprise customer who uses Key Management Service (KMS) or Multiple Activation Key (MAK) volume activation, we generally recommend to NOT install this update in their reference image or already deployed computers. This update is targeted at consumer installs of Windows using RETAIL activation."

We strongly recommend that you uninstall [KB971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) from all volume-licensed Windows 7-based devices. This includes devices that are not currently affected by the issue that is mentioned in the [Symptoms](#symptoms) section.

    ```console
    dism /online /get-packages
    ```

    wmic qfe where HotFixID="KB971033"
    ```

    ```  

After [KB 971033](https://support.microsoft.com/help/971033) is uninstalled, or after it no longer appears as installed, rebuild the activation-related files and then reactivate the system by running the following commands in a Command Prompt window as administrator:

```console
net stop sppuinotify
sc config sppuinotify start= disabled
net stop sppsvc
del %windir%\system32\7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-5P-0.C7483456-A289-439d-8115-601632D005A0 /ah

cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk <edition-specific KMS client key>
cscript c:\windows\system32\slmgr.vbs /ato
sc config sppuinotify start= demand
```

> [!NOTE]
> In the first cscript command, replace \<edition-specific KMS client key> with the actual key. For more information, see [KMS Client Setup Keys](/windows-server/get-started/kmsclientkeys).

The following table lists the KMS client keys for each edition of Windows 7.
