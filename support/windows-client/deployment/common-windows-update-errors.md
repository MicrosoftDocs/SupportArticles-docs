This error generally means that the Windows Update Agent was unable to connect to the update servers or your own update source, such as WSUS, Configuration Manager, or Microsoft Intune, due to a proxy error. <br> Verify the proxy settings on the client. The Windows Update Agent uses WinHTTP to scan for available updates. When there's a proxy server between the client and the update source, the proxy settings must be configured correctly on the clients to enable them to communicate by using the source's FQDN. <br> Check with your network and proxy teams to confirm that the device can the update source without the proxy requiring user authentication. |

## 0x80244022

|CBS_E_INSTALLERS_FAILED|The July cumulative update failed to be installed on Windows Server 2016|In the CBS.log, you may find that updates sometimes roll back when License and Product key tokens fail to be updated. This issue can be resolved by adding write permissions for the "User" and "Network Service" accounts to the _C:\\Windows\\System32\\spp\\_ folder.|

## 0x80070bc9

| Message | Description | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
|ERROR_FAIL_REBOOT_REQUIRED|The TrustedInstaller service startup type is set to "Manual" by Group Policy (GPO), which prevented it from starting to complete pending operations.|The TrustedInstaller service changes the startup type from Manual to Automatic when it encounters an update that has to process a transaction after a restart. When the value is set back to Manual before the restart, the transaction cannot be applied. This transaction will be pending and block all other update installations.<br/>To fix this issue, change the TrustedInstaller policy to **Automatic** and restart the computer. If it doesn't work, start the computer to WinRE to revert the pending actions. For example, `dism /Image:C:\ /Cleanup-Image /RevertPendingActions`. If it doesn't work either, start the computer to WinRE, rename *\WinSxS\Pending.xml*, and remove the PendingXMLIdentifier from COMPONENTS Hive.|

## 0x800706be

To resolve this issue, navigate to the registry key for the corrupted update package. Change the “current state” value to 000020 hex (32 dec) - resolved, or 000040 hex (64 dec) - staged, or 000070 hex (112 dec) - installed.|
