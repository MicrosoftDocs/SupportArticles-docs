# DISM /Apply-Image command fails with error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED)

This article provides a workaround for an issue where `DISM /Apply-Image` command fails with error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3179598

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a Windows 10 image.
- You enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature.
- You download and install Ubuntu package by using the command that's documented [here](/windows/wsl/reference).
- You capture the Windows 10 image by using the `DISM /Capture-Image` command.
- You try to apply the captured Windows 10 image by using the `DISM /Apply-Image` command.

In this scenario, the `DISM /Apply-Image` command fails with error code 5 (ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED).

## Cause

The files that are installed by the Ubuntu package may cause `DISM /Apply-Image` to fail.

## Workaround

Do not download and install the Ubuntu package before you capture the Windows 10 image by using the `DISM /Capture-Image` command. The Ubuntu package can be downloaded and installed after the Windows 10 image is applied to a device. You can install the Ubuntu package by following the steps in this [installation guide](/windows/wsl/install-win10).
