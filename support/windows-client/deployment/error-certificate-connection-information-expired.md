This article helps resolve an issue in which you receive the "certificate in the connection information has expired" error when accessing an Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) virtual machine (VM).

When you try to connect to an AVD VM by using the Remote Desktop client for Windows, you receive the following error message:

This issue occurs when multiple users try to connect to the AVD VMs.

## Reset and reinstall the Remote Desktop client for Windows

To fix this issue, follow these steps:

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the `.\msrdcw.exe /reset /f` cmdlet to force a reset of the user data.

1.	Start the Remote Desktop client for Windows, select the three dots (â€¦) at the top right corner, and then select Reset.

2.	Close and uninstall the client.
3.	Install [the latest version of the client](/azure/virtual-desktop/whats-new-client-windows).

For proper functionality, make sure that safe URLs are not subject to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) inspection from the perspective of the Remote Desktop client. Also, verify that no blocking mechanisms are interfering with the safe URLs listed for the Remote Desktop client. If the above method doesn't work, try to disable or uninstall the antivirus software.
