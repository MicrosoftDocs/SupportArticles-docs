## Update the Automatic Updates feature (Windows XP and Windows 2000 only)

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Automatic Updates, the feature may have been automatically updated on your computer. To make sure that the new feature is installed, use the procedure that is described in the [Schedule Automatic Updates](#schedule-automatic-updates) section of this article to confirm that the **Automatically download the updates, and install them on the schedule that I specify** option is available on your computer.

To use the new Automatic Updates feature, install the following updates:

Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1). For additional information about how to obtain SP1, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

> [!NOTE]
> You must restart your computer after you install this update. Automatic Updates does not download any updates until you have configured it to do so. If Automatic Updates is not configured in 24 hours after you install it, either the network administrator or the user who is logged on locally as an administrator is prompted to configure it.

## Schedule automatic updates

> [!NOTE]
> To modify Automatic Updates settings, you must be logged on as an administrator or a member of the Administrators group. If your computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from completing this procedure.
