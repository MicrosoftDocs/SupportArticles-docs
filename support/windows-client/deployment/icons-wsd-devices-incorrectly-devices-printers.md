# Icons for WSD devices may show up incorrectly as a different class under Devices and Printers

This article provides a resolution to an issue where icons for Web Services for Devices (WSD) devices may show up incorrectly as a different class under Devices and Printers.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2403006

## Symptoms

A WSD device may show the incorrect icon when viewed in Devices and Printers. For example, a WSD printer may show up with a Server icon and appear under Devices instead of showing a printer icon under Printers and Faxes.

## Cause

This issue is caused by an incorrect Device Stage package released by Microsoft and available between June 8 and June 22, 2010.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, clear out the Device Stage Metadata Store and download new packages. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open an elevated (Administrator) Command Prompt.
2. Type `del /s "%systemdrive%\users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Device Metadata\\\*.*"` and press Enter.
3. Type *Y* to the **Are you sure (Y/N)** prompt and press Enter.
4. You may need to type *Y* to confirm several more deletions, depending on the number of Device Stage packages currently on your computer. (all of them will be freshly downloaded by Windows)

These steps will delete the cache contents containing the incorrect package and prompt Windows 7 to redownload the appropriate packages with the correct Device Metadata.

## Data collection

If you need assistance from Microsoft support, we recommend you collect the information by following the steps mentioned in [Gather information by using TSS for deployment-related issues](../windows-troubleshooters/gather-information-using-tss-deployment.md).
