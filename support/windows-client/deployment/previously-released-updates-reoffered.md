## Cause

The updates that are listed here were not included in the stand-alone November 2014 update package or released in conjunction with that update package.

## Resolution

When you build your reference image, you should either install these updates through Windows Update or download and install them manually.

## More information

There are scenarios in which update [2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2919355)  (Windows RT 8.1, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 R2 update: April 2014) or will also be reoffered. These scenarios and their resolutions are as follows.

### Scenario 1

Images were built by using the April 2014 volume license media, and you have update 3000850 installed.

Resolution Integrate update 2959977 and update 2934018 by using the DISM method. (This method is described later.)

### Scenario 2

Images that were built by using the November 2014 or April 2014 volume license media on which one of the following language packs was later installed: cs-cz, da-dk, de-de, el-gr, es-es, fi-fi, fr-fr, hu-hu, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, nb-no, nl-nl, pl-pl, pt-br ,pt-pt, ru-ru, sv-se, tr-tr, zh-cn, zh-hk, zh-tw.

Resolution Install the language packs that are required for the environment before you install update 2913955. Or, install update 2934018 by using the stand-alone installer.

### Scenario 3

Images that were built by using the November 2014 volume license media in which a language pack was later installed may be reoffered.

Resolution: Use Windows Update to complete the installation of the missing language components

### The DISM method

To integrate packages into an image by using the DISM method, follow these steps:

1. Download the standalone package for the update or updates that you want to integrate.
2. Create a new directory to expand the update package.
3. Extract the update package by using the following command:

    expand -f:* < **path to .msu** > < **destination** >

    For example, the following command expands update 2959977 to the C:\Cabs folder:

    expand -f:* Windows8.1-KB2959977-x64.msu c:\cabs

4. Integrate the expanded cabinet (.cab) file into the image from the expanded package by using the following command:

    DISM /Online /Add-Package /PackagePath:< **path to extracted .cab file from step 3** >

    For example, the command to integrate the update 2959977 .cab file would be as follows:

    DISM /Online /Add-Package /PackagePath:c:\cabs\Windows8.1-KB2959977-x64.cab
