# Sysprep and Capture task sequence fails when it tries to capture Windows images

This article provides a workaround for an issue where the Sysprep and Capture task sequence fails when it tries to capture Windows images.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2797676

## Symptoms

The issue affects the Sysprep and captures TS in the following products:

- Microsoft Deployment 2012 Update 1
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit 2013

The Sysprep and Capture task sequence fails when it tries to capture a Windows image that was installed from a media. Additionally, you may receive the following errors:

> Deployment Summary

Review the log files to determine the cause of the problem.  
During the deployment process, 14 errors and 0 warning were reported.

Also, when you check the BDD.log file, you may notice that the following errors are logged:

## Cause

This problem occurs because the LTIApply.wsf script fails to check for the existence of the boot folder on the system partition before the script runs the `takeown.exe` command to change ownership on the folder. The `takeown.exe` command fails with a "Not Found" error if the boot folder doesn't exist. This causes the Sysprep and Capture task sequence to fail.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, edit the following files:  

- %DeployRoot%\Scripts\LTIApply.wsf

    > [!NOTE]
    > %DeployRoot% is the path that you specified when the deployment share was created.

- C:\Program files\Microsoft Deployment Toolkit\Templates\Distribution\Scripts\LTIApply.wsf  

Locate the "Copy bootmgr" section in LTIApply.wsf, and then add the following code above the existing code under the "Copy bootmgr" section:

```vbscript
If not oFSO.FolderExists(sBootDrive & "\Boot") then
 oFSO.CreateFolder(sBootDrive & "\Boot")
End if
```

## More information

This issue doesn't occur if you capture a Windows image that was originally deployed by using MDT 2012 Update 1. This is because when Windows is deployed by using MDT, a System Reserved partition is created that has a size of 499 megabytes (MB). There is enough free space in the System Reserved partition to apply the WinPE image that is required for the capture.

If the Windows image that you are trying to capture with the Sysprep and Capture task sequence was originally deployed from a Windows media, the System Reserved partition that is created has a size of 350 MB. And because it already contains the WinRE image, it does not have enough free space for MDT to apply the WinPE image. In this case, the LTIApply script automatically selects the System Partition to apply the WinPE image. As part of this process, the LTIApply script changes ownership on the bootmgr file and the boot folder on the System Partition. The problem occurs because the LTIApply script doesn't check for the existence of the boot folder on the System Partition before it runs the `takeown.exe` command to change ownership.
