# Windows Update automatically downloads and installs updates when you connect to the Internet for the first time

This article describes that if you select the default Windows Update option when you install Windows Vista, important updates are automatically downloaded and installed.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Vista  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 931275

## Summary

In Windows Vista, when you connect to the Internet for the first time, you're prompted to install driver updates, critical software updates, and recommended software updates. Or, if you select the default Windows Update option when you install Windows Vista, these updates are automatically downloaded and installed. So you don't have to wait until the scheduled time to download the updates. By default, updates are downloaded and installed at 3:00 A.M. every morning.

This process occurs regardless of how you connect to the Internet. For example, this process occurs whether you connect to the Internet by using a cable connection, a DSL connection, or a dial-up modem.

## More information

We recommend that you use Windows Update to check for the updated hardware drivers.

To manually update Windows Vista by using Windows Update, follow these steps:

1. Select **Start**, type update in the **Start Search** box, and then select **Windows Update** in the **Programs** list.
2. In the upper-left corner of the **Windows Update** window, select **Check for updates**.
3. Select **View available updates** when you're presented with a summary of available updates.
4. In the **View available updates** window, click to select the updates that you want to install, and then select **Install**.
