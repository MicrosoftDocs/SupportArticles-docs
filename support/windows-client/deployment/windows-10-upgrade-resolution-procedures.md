# Windows 10 upgrade resolution procedures

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a 200 level topic (moderate).
>  
> For IT professionals, check more information in [Resolve Windows 10 upgrade errors](/windows/deployment/upgrade/resolve-windows-10-upgrade-errors).

This article provides some common causes and solutions that are associated with specific upgrade error codes. If a Windows 10 upgrade fails, you can write down the error code that is displayed, or find the error code in the Windows [Event Log](/windows/deployment/upgrade/windows-error-reporting) or in the Windows Setup [log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files) (ex: *setuperr.log*) and review the cause and solutions provided here. You should also try running the free [SetupDiag](/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag) tool provided by Microsoft, which can automatically find the reason for an upgrade failure.

## 0xC1900101

A frequently observed [result code](/windows/deployment/upgrade/upgrade-error-codes#result-codes) is 0xC1900101. This result code can be thrown at any stage of the upgrade process, with the exception of the downlevel phase. 0xC1900101 is a generic rollback code, and usually indicates that an incompatible driver is present. The incompatible driver can cause blue screens, system hangs, and unexpected reboots. Analysis of supplemental log files is often helpful, such as:  

- The minidump file: *$Windows.~bt\\Sources\\Rollback\\setupmem.dmp*
- Event logs: *$Windows.~bt\\Sources\\Rollback\*.evtx*
- The device install log: *$Windows.~bt\Sources\Rollback\setupapi\setupapi.dev.log*

The device install log is helpful if rollback occurs during the sysprep operation (extend code 0x30018).  

To resolve a rollback that was caused by driver conflicts, try running setup using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs by performing a [clean boot](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135) before initiating the upgrade process.

See the following general troubleshooting procedures associated with a result code of 0xC1900101:

| Code | Mitigation | Cause |
| :---     |  :---  |  :--- |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x20004   | Uninstall antivirus applications.<br>Remove all unused SATA devices. <br>Remove all unused devices and drivers. <br>Update drivers and BIOS.     | Windows Setup encountered an error during the SAFE_OS with the INSTALL_RECOVERY_ENVIRONMENT operation. <br>This error is caused by out-of-date drivers.    |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x2000c     | Disconnect all peripheral devices that are connected to the system, except for the mouse, keyboard and display.<br> Contact your hardware vendor to obtain updated device drivers.<br> Ensure that "Download and install updates (recommended)" is accepted at the start of the upgrade process.       | Windows Setup encountered an unspecified error during Wim apply in the WinPE phase.<br> This error is caused by out-of-date drivers      |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 | Ensure that all that drivers are updated.<br>Open the Setuperr.log and Setupact.log files in the %windir%\Panther directory, and then locate the problem drivers.<br>For more information, see [Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 setup log file locations](windows-setup-log-file-locations.md).<br>Update or uninstall the problem drivers. | A driver has caused an illegal operation.<br>Windows wasn't able to migrate the driver, resulting in a rollback of the operating system.<br>This is a SafeOS boot failure, typically caused by drivers or non-Microsoft disk encryption software.<br>This can also be caused by a hardware failure. |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x30018 | Disconnect all peripheral devices that are connected to the system, except for the mouse, keyboard and display.<br>Contact your hardware vendor to obtain updated device drivers.<br>Ensure that &quot;Download and install updates (recommended)&quot; is accepted at the start of the upgrade process. | A device driver has stopped responding to setup.exe during the upgrade process. |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x3000D | Disconnect all peripheral devices that are connected to the system, except for the mouse, keyboard and display.<br>Update or uninstall the display driver. | Installation failed during the FIRST_BOOT phase while attempting the MIGRATE_DATA operation.<br>This can occur due to a problem with a display driver. |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x4000D | Check supplemental rollback logs for a setupmem.dmp file, or event logs for any unexpected reboots or errors.<br>Review the rollback log and determine the stop code.<br>The rollback log is located in the *$Windows.~BT\\Sources\\Rollback* folder.  An example analysis is shown below. This example isn't representative of all cases:<br>&nbsp;<br>Info SP     Crash 0x0000007E detected<br>Info SP       Module name           :<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 1: 0xFFFFFFFFC0000005<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 2: 0xFFFFF8015BC0036A<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 3: 0xFFFFD000E5D23728<br>Info SP       Bugcheck parameter 4: 0xFFFFD000E5D22F40<br>Info SP     Can't recover the system.<br>Info SP     Rollback: Showing splash window with restoring text: Restoring your previous version of Windows.<br>&nbsp;<br>Typically, there's a dump file for the crash to analyze. If you aren't equipped to debug the dump, then attempt the following basic troubleshooting procedures:<br>&nbsp;<br>1. Make sure you have enough disk space.<br>2. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.<br>3. Try changing video adapters.<br>4. Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates.<br>5. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. | A rollback occurred due to a driver configuration issue.<br>Installation failed during the second boot phase while attempting the MIGRATE_DATA operation.<br>This can occur because of incompatible drivers. |
| 0xC1900101 - 0x40017 | Clean boot into Windows, and then attempt the upgrade to Windows 10. For more information, see [How to perform a clean boot in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135).<br>Ensure that you select the option to "Download and install updates (recommended)."<br>&nbsp;<br>Computers that run Citrix VDA  <br>You may see this message after you upgrade a computer from Windows 10, version 1511 to Windows 10, version 1607. After the second system restart, the system generates this error and then rolls back to the previous version. This problem has also been observed in upgrades to Windows 8.1 and Windows 8.  <br>&nbsp;<br>This problem occurs because the computer has Citrix Virtual Delivery Agent (VDA) installed. Citrix VDA installs device drivers and a file system filter driver (CtxMcsWbc). This Citrix filter driver prevents the upgrade from writing changes to the disk, so the upgrade can't complete and the system rolls back.  <br>&nbsp;<br>Resolution<br>&nbsp;<br>To resolve this problem, install [Cumulative update for Windows 10 Version 1607 and Windows Server 2016: November 8, 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3200970/cumulative-update-for-windows-10-version-1607-and-windows-server-2016).<br>&nbsp;<br>You can work around this problem in two ways:<br>&nbsp;<br>Workaround 1<br>&nbsp;<br>1. Use the VDA setup application (VDAWorkstationSetup_7.11) to uninstall Citrix VDA.<br>2. Run the Windows upgrade again.<br>3. Reinstall Citrix VDA.<br>&nbsp;<br>Workaround 2<br>&nbsp;<br>If you can't uninstall Citrix VDA, follow these steps to work around this problem:  <br>&nbsp;<br>1. In Registry Editor, go to the following subkey:<br> `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\CtxMcsWbc`<br>2. Change the value of the `Start` entry from **0** to **4**. This change disables the Citrix MCS cache service.<br>3. Go to the following subkey:<br> `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}`<br>4. Delete the `CtxMcsWbc` entry.<br>5. Restart the computer, and then try the upgrade again.<br>&nbsp;<br>Non-Microsoft information disclaimer  <br>The non-Microsoft products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products. | Windows 10 upgrade failed after the second reboot.<br>This is caused by a faulty driver. For example: antivirus filter drivers or encryption drivers. |

## 0x800xxxxx

Result codes that start with the digits 0x800 are also important to understand. These error codes indicate general operating system errors, and aren't unique to the Windows upgrade process. Examples include timeouts, devices not functioning, and a process stopping unexpectedly.

See the following general troubleshooting procedures associated with a result code of 0x800xxxxx:

| Code | Mitigation | Cause |
| :---     |  :---  |  :--- |
| 80040005 - 0x20007     |  This error has more than one possible cause. Attempt [quick fixes](windows-10-upgrade-quick-fixes.md), and if not successful, [analyze log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files#analyze-log-files) in order to determine the problem and solution.  |   An unspecified error occurred with a driver during the SafeOS phase.   |
| 0x80073BC3 - 0x20009<br>0x80070002 - 0x20009<br>0x80073B92 - 0x20009     |  These errors occur during partition analysis and validation, and can be caused by the presence of multiple system partitions. For example, if you installed a new system drive but left the previous system drive connected, this can cause a conflict. To resolve the errors, disconnect or temporarily disable drives that contain the unused system partition. You can reconnect the drive after the upgrade has completed. Alternatively, you can delete the unused system partition.  |   The requested system device can't be found, there's a sharing violation, or there are multiple devices matching the identification criteria.   |
| 800704B8 - 0x3001A   |  Disable or uninstall non-Microsoft antivirus applications, disconnect all unnecessary devices, and perform a [clean boot](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135).  |   An extended error has occurred during the first boot phase.   |
| 8007042B - 0x4000D    |  [Analyze log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files#analyze-log-files) in order to determine the file, application, or driver that isn't able to be migrated. Disconnect, update, remove, or replace the device or object.  |   The installation failed during the second boot phase while attempting the MIGRATE_DATA operation.<br>This issue can occur due to file system, application, or driver issues.   |
| 8007001F - 0x3000D    |  [Analyze log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files#analyze-log-files) in order to determine the files or registry entries that are blocking data migration.<br>&nbsp;<br>This error can be due to a problem with user profiles. It can occur due to corrupt registry entries under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList` or invalid files in the *\\Users* directory.<br>&nbsp;<br>Note: If a previous upgrade didn't complete, invalid profiles might exist in the *Windows.old\\Users* directory.<br>&nbsp;<br>To repair this error, ensure that deleted accounts aren't still present in the Windows registry and that files under the *\\Users* directory are valid. Delete the invalid files or user profiles that are causing this error. The specific files and profiles that are causing the error will be recorded in the Windows setup log files.|   The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation.   |
| 8007001F - 0x4000D     |  [Analyze log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files#analyze-log-files) in order to determine the device that isn't functioning properly. Disconnect, update, or replace the device.  |   General failure, a device attached to the system isn't functioning.   |
| 8007042B - 0x4001E   |  This error has more than one possible cause. Attempt [quick fixes](windows-10-upgrade-quick-fixes.md), and if not successful, [analyze log files](/windows/deployment/upgrade/log-files#analyze-log-files) in order to determine the problem and solution.  |   The installation failed during the second boot phase while attempting the PRE_OOBE operation.   |
