# Multiple operations fail if Windows 8 is improperly identified as a Windows To Go installation

This article discusses issues that occur when Windows 8 is improperly identified as a Windows To Go installation.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 8  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2778881

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:  

- You have a computer that is running Windows 8.
- The Windows may report that it's running as a Windows To Go (WTG) installation, while it's not.
- Running or configuring certain Windows components may fail since the OS is reported as Windows to Go. Since these components aren't expected to work and shouldn't work when running Windows To Go installations.

In this scenario, you may notice the following issues:  

- Refresh your PC fails reporting:

    Your PC can't be refreshed because it's running Windows To Go  

- The Windows To Go control panel reports:

    Can't change startup options when you're in a Windows To Go Workspace  

- Microsoft Store fails with error

    Microsoft Store isn't available on Windows To Go Workspaces  

## Cause

Certain functionality may be blocked from working on Windows To Go Installations as the user experience may not work as desired or expected.
