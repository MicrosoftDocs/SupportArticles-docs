# Access Denied when you access an SMB file share in Windows

This article helps fix the **Access Denied** error that occurs when you access a Server Message Block (SMB) file share.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3035936

## Symptoms

When you try to access a specific folder that's located on a Network Appliance (NetApp) Filer or a Windows Server that supports SMB2 from a Windows-based system through the SMB Version 2 protocol, the access is denied. This issue occurs in the following version of Windows:

- Windows 8.1
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows 8
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows 7
- Windows Server 2008 R2
- Windows Vista
- Windows Server 2008

> [!NOTE]
> This issue doesn't occur if you disable the SMB2 protocol on the client or use a Windows SMB client, such as Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.

## Cause

This issue occurs because the target folder on the SMB share is missing the SYNCHRONIZE access control entries.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use the [ICACLS utility](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc753525(v=ws.10)) to set the desired permissions that contain the Synchronize bit.

For example, at a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

```console
ICACLS h:\folder /grant domain\user:(RC,RD,REA,RA,X,S)
```

A comma-separated list in parentheses of specific rights:

- RC - read control
- RD - read data/list directory
- REA - read extended attributes
- RA - read attributes
- X - execute/traverse
- S - Synchronize

## Troubleshooting

You can use the following methods to verify and troubleshoot the issue.

1. Verify that the NetApp Filer has the Synchronize bit set on the folder.
2. A network trace can show the **DesiredAccess** error for the SMB2 CREATE process on the folder for the Request and Response packet.
3. The [AccessChk.exe tool](/sysinternals/downloads/accesschk) is available on [Windows Sysinternals](/sysinternals/) site for reading out the permission settings.

    For example, run the following command:

    ```console
    C:\tools\Sysinternals\accesschk.exe -ld
    ```

    Then, you can see the following result that shows the SYNCHRONIZE bit is set:

    > [2] ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE: BUILTIN\Users  
    [OBJECT_INHERIT_ACE]  
    [CONTAINER_INHERIT_ACE]  
    [INHERITED_ACE]  
    FILE_LIST_DIRECTORY  
    FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES  
    FILE_READ_EA  
    FILE_TRAVERSE  
    SYNCHRONIZE  
    READ_CONTROL

    See the [behavior of the SYNCHRONIZE bit](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb2/a64e55aa-1152-48e4-8206-edd96444e7f7) on Windows SMB2 clients.
