Instead of obtaining an IP address automatically, specify an IP address. Follow these instructions:

1. Select **Use the following IP address** if you want to specify the IP address for the network adapter.
2. In the **IP address** box, type the IP address that you want to assign to this network adapter. This IP address must be a unique address in the range of addresses that are available for your network. Contact the network administrator to obtain a list of valid IP addresses for your network.
3. In the **Subnet mask** box, type the subnet mask for your network.
4. In the **Default gateway** box, type the IP address of the computer or device on your network that connects your network to another network or to the Internet.
5. In the **Preferred DNS server** box, type the IP address of the computer that resolves host names to IP addresses.
6. In the **Alternate DNS server** box, type the IP address of the DNS computer that you want to use if the preferred DNS server becomes unavailable.
7. Select **OK**. In the **Local Area Connection Properties** dialog box, select **Close**.
8. In the **Local Area Connection Status** dialog box, select **Close**.
