# Can't install the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features in Windows 10 or Windows 11

This article provides workarounds to install the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) SNMP Provider features in Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## Error when installing the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features

You try to install the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features in Windows 10 or Windows 11 by using the [Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe)](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/what-is-dism) tool as follows:

```console
dism /online /enable-feature /featureName:SNMP /featureName:WMISnmpProvider
```

Then, you receive this error message:

> Error: 0x800f080c  
> Feature name SNMP is unknown.  
> Feature name WMISnmpProvider is unknown.  
> A Windows feature name was not recognized.  
> Use the /Get-Features option to find the name of the feature in the image and try the command again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This issue occurs because the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features are deprecated.

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

## Install the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features from the Settings page

1. Go to Start, select **Settings** > **Apps**.
2. Under **Apps & features**, select **Optional features** > **Add a feature**.
    - To install the SNMP feature, select **Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)** > **Install**.
    - To install the WMI SNMP Provider feature, select **WMI SNMP Provider** > **Install**.

To verify the installation state, select **See optional features history**.

## Install the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features by using Windows PowerShell

1. Start Windows PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Run the following [Add-WindowsCapability](/powershell/module/dism/add-windowscapability) cmdlets to install the SNMP and WMI SNMP Provider features.

    ```powershell
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "SNMP.Client~~~~0.0.1.0"
    ```

    ```powershell
    Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "WMI-SNMP-Provider.Client~~~~0.0.1.0"
    ```

To verify the installation state, run the following [Get-WindowsCapability](/powershell/module/dism/get-windowscapability) cmdlets.

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "SNMP.Client~~~~0.0.1.0"
```

```powershell
Get-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "WMI-SNMP-Provider.Client~~~~0.0.1.0"
```

The state is **Installed** if these features are installed correctly.
