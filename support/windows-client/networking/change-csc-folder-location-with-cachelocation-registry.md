> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

To change the location of the CSC folder, follow these steps.

> [!NOTE]
> There is only one cache folder in Windows Vista. Therefore, you do not have to repeat these steps for additional users.

1. Click **Start**, type **regedit** in the **Search** box, and then press ENTER.
2. Locate the following registry subkey, and then and right-click it:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CSC`  

3. Point to **New**, and then click **Key**.
4. Type Parameters in the name box for the new key.
5. Right-click the **Parameters** key, point to **New**, and then click **String Value**.
6. To name the new value, type CacheLocation, and then press ENTER.

7. Right-click **CacheLocation**, and then click **Modify**.

8. In the **Value data** box, type the name of the new folder in which you want to create the cache.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use the Microsoft Windows NT format for the folder name.

    For example, if you want the cache location to be d:\csc, type the following: \??\d:\csc  

9. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

> [!NOTE]
> The network administrator can set this value before the computer is on the network or before this value is given to the end-user. In this situation, no content is put in the default location. Additionally, you can set the location of the CSC folder by using a script.
