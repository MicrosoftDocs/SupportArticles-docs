For Windows 8.1, install [Offline Files network shares might not be available in Windows 8.1](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3078627).

Under some circumstances, it might be necessary to reset the Offline Files database to reestablish the sync partnerships. These KB articles describe how to do it, or you can run the reg.exe command line to set the key followed by a reboot.

Folder redirection can move content when the folder redirection target is changed.

It's straight forward, except when moving between different names that are actually the same location - for example from NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) to FQDN name, or from server name to DFSN name.

To make sure that the move in these situations is successful, following group policy has to be set:

_Verify Old and New folder redirection targets point to the same share before redirecting_ under `Windows Components\File Explorer` (or Windows Explorer)

Next of course Offline Files is involved because the redirected folder target is by default made offline available.

When the path is changed FR copies the data to the new location that can cause significant delays and corresponding network traffic (especially links with higher latency or when many users are migrated at the same time).

The bandwidth usage for this can't be controlled easily so an option is to copy the data on the backend to the new location with, for example, robocopy.

To make sure the minimum traffic is generated with the already copied data Folder Redirection will try to rename the data in the cache to the new location, rather than actually copying it. For this to work, you must set following registry key (via GPO preferences for example) for the user.

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ DWORD: FolderRedirectionEnableCacheRename: 1`

This key always has to be set.

Other data that is made available offline through admin assigning or manually making offline available is NOT automatically moved/ renamed.
