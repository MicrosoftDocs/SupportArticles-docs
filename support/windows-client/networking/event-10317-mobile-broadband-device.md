>Log Name: System

Event ID: 10317  
Task Category: PnP  
Level: Error  
Keywords: (16384),(16),(4),(2)  
User: <*User Name*>  
Computer: <*Computer Name*>  
Description:  
Miniport <*Mobile broadband device name*>, {*GUID*}, had event Fatal error: The miniport has failed a power transition to operational power  

## Cause

This error is logged when a request is sent to the mobile broadband device and a response is not received in 400 milliseconds. This frequently occurs when the mobile broadband device was turned off and is restarting. For example, this may occur during an initial start or when the device resumes from sleep or hibernation. In most cases, the device cannot start fast enough to be able to respond in the 400-millisecond window. After the device is fully turned on, these errors are typically no longer logged because the device is awake and able to respond quickly.

## Resolution

These errors can safely be ignored when they are logged during or shortly after the device is turned on or resumed from sleep.
