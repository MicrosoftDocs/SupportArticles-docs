# Error 2250 (NERR_UseNotFound) when LanmanWorkstation service doesn't start

This article describes how to resolve an issue in which the LanManWorkstation service doesn't start and Windows generates Error 2250.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows 11, Windows 10

## Symptoms

The LanmanWorkstation service doesn't start, and Windows generates the following message:

> Windows could not start the Workstation on Local Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 2250.

> [!NOTE]  
> This behavior might affect other services in addition to the LanmanWorkstation service.

## Cause

This error typically indicates that the following volatile registry entry is missing:

> Registry subkey: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ActiveComputerName`
> - Registry type: REG_SZ
> - Registry key: `ComputerName`
> - Value: <*Computer_Name*>

This value should be the same value as the value of the following non-volatile entry:

> Registry subkey: `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName`
> - Registry type: REG_SZ
> - Registry key: ComputerName
> - Value: <*Computer_Name*>

> [!NOTE]  
> In both registry entries, <*Computer_Name*> represents the name of the local computer.

## Resolution

[!INCLUDE [registry](../../includes/registry-important-alert.md)]

To resolve this issue, add the missing registry entry on the affected computer. Either use Registry Editor to manually create the entry, or open an administrative Command Prompt window, and then run the following command:

```console
reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ActiveComputerName /t REG_SZ /v ComputerName /d <Computer_Name> /f
```

> [!NOTE]  
> In this command, <Computer_Name> represents the name of the local computer.

After you edit the registry, restart the computer.
