# Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP) option is missing while creating the Wireless Profile

This article provides a solution to an issue where Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP) option is missing in some cases.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2699785

## Symptoms

There are multiple symptoms for the issue:

- Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP) option may be missing while creating the Wireless Profile on a client.
- Microsoft: Protected EAP (PEAP) option may go missing once we start file transfer using Window Easy Transfer wizard.
- Remote Access Connection Manager does not start.

## Cause

The default location of the file SymRasMan.dll is %SystemRoot%\System32\rastls.dll. On installing Symantec Antivirus or Symantec Endpoint Protection the default location is then changed and edited in the registry to C:\Program Files\ Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection \SymRasMan.dll. After uninstallation this location is not reversed. The issue occurs because of a problem with registry keys that are not reverted to the defaults or .dll files indicated in registry values do not exist after removing Symantec Endpoint Protection 11.0.

These 2 registry hives are affected:

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\25`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13`

The values of the following keys under EAP are modified from C:\System32\rastls.dll to C:\Program Files\Symantec\Symantec Endpoint Protection\SymRasMan.dll.

- ConfigUiPath
- IdentityPath
- InteractiveUIPath
- Path

4 new registry keys with their value as C:\Windows\ System32\rastls.dll are created.

- ConfigUiPathBack
- IdentityPathBack
- InteractiveUIPathBack
- PathBack
