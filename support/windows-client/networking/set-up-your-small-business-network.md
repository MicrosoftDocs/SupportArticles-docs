## Evaluate network types

Many small businesses use a network to share access to the Internet, printers, and files from one computer to another. While having a network almost surely benefits your business, you need to decide which kind of network is the best option for your business depending on its unique and specific needs. The choices you have are wired, wireless, and hybrid networks.
When you select a network for your business, you should consider two main points - the location of your devices and how fast you want your network to be. Although costs are similar between the different types, prices will vary according to the network speed that you select.

The following sections describe the different network options available.

### Wired networks

Wired or Ethernet networks can transfer data from 10 Mbps to 1000 Mbps, depending on the type of cables you use. Gigabit Ethernet provides the fastest transfer rate at up to 1 gigabit per second (1000 Mbps).

#### Advantages

- Ethernet networks are highly secure and fast.
- Ethernet networks are safer than wireless networks because they're fully contained.
- Ethernet networks aren't affected by interference of objects or walls.

#### Drawbacks

- You must run Ethernet cables between each device and a hub, switch, or router. It can be time-consuming and difficult when devices are in different rooms.
- The hardware is more expensive.

#### Hardware requirements

|Hardware|How many|
|---|---|
|Ethernet network adapter<br/>An adapter connects devices to a network so that they can communicate. You can connect a network adapter to a USB port with either Ethernet cables or USB cables, depending on the type of adapter. You can also install a network adapter inside a device.|One for each device on your network. Desktop computers usually have these adapters built in.|
|Ethernet hub or switch<br/>A hub passes data from one device to another. Because the hub can't identify the data source as coming from the Internet or another device, it sends the information to all connected devices, including the one that sent it. A switch works similar to a hub. But a switch can also identify the intended destination of the information so that only the intended devices receive it. A switch costs a bit more than a hub, but has faster speed.|One. A 10/100/1000 hub or switch is best and should have enough ports to accommodate all the devices on your network.|
|Ethernet router (only needed if you want to connect more than two devices that share an Internet connection)<br/>A router helps you share a single Internet connection among several devices. You don't require a router to set up a wired network, but you should use one if you want multiple devices to share an Internet connection.|One. You might need an extra hub or switch if your router doesn't have enough ports for all of your devices.|
|Modem<br/>Devices use modems to send and receive information over telephone or cable lines. You need a modem if you want to connect to the Internet.|One.|
|Ethernet cables<br/>Network cables connect devices to one another and to other related hardware, such as hubs, routers, and external network adapters.|One for each device that needs to connect to the network hub or switch. 10/100/1000 Cat 6 cables are best, but not required.|
|||

### Wireless networks

Wireless networks can transfer data anywhere from 10-600 megabytes per second (Mbps) depending on the type of wireless standard that your modem uses.

#### Advantages

- You can easily move devices because there are no cables.
- Wireless networks are cheaper to install than wired networks.
- You can often improve the wireless signal by using a wireless repeater. Wireless repeaters pick up a signal, and if the signal has degraded, the repeater can rebroadcast it again at full strength.

#### Drawbacks

- Wireless technology is often slower than wired technologies.
- Wireless technology can be affected by interference from walls, large metal objects, and pipes. Also, many cordless phones and microwave ovens can interfere with wireless networks when in use.
- Wireless networks are frequently about half as fast as their rated speed.

#### Hardware requirements

|Hardware|How many|
|---|---|
|Wireless network adapter<br/>An adapter connects devices to a network so that they can communicate.|One for each device on your network. Portable devices usually have them built in.|
|Wireless router<br/>A router helps you share a single Internet connection among several devices. You don't require a router to set up a wired network, but you should use one if you want multiple devices to share an Internet connection.|One.|
|||

If your device has built-in wireless capabilities, then you don't need a wireless network adapter.

### Hybrid networks

Hybrid networks use a combination of wireless and wired networks and offer the best of both network types so that you can use faster wired desktops and portable wireless mobile devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. A hybrid network relies on special hybrid routers, hubs, switches, and Ethernet cables to connect wired and wireless devices. A hybrid router does two things - broadcasts a wireless signal and provides wired access ports. It's most commonly referred to as a wireless or Wi-Fi router with Ethernet ports or "LAN ports".

A hybrid wired/wireless network seems to offer the best of both worlds in speed, mobility, affordability and security. If users need maximum Internet and file-sharing speed, they can plug into the network with an Ethernet cable. If they need to share a streaming video in the office hallway, they can access the network wirelessly. With the right planning, an organization can save money on CAT5/CAT6 cables and routers by maximizing the reach of the wireless network. With the right encryption and password management in place, the wireless portion of the network can be as secure as the wired.

|Hardware|How many|
|---|---|
|Network adapter<br/>An adapter connects devices to a network so that they can communicate.|One for each device on your network. Both desktops and portable devices usually have these adapters built in.|
|hybrid router<br/>A router helps you share a single Internet connection among several devices. You don't require a router to set up a wired network, but you should use one if you want multiple devices to share an Internet connection.|At least one. If you need to connect more than four wired devices, add an extra wired router.|
|Ethernet cables<br/>Network cables connect devices to one another and to other related hardware, such as hubs, routers, and external network adapters.|One for each device connected to the network hub or switch. 10/100/1000 Cat 6 cables are best, but not required.|

## Install a wired network

Wired networks are faster, more secure, and reliable than wireless networks. They also reduce the chance of outside interference. At the same time, they require a bit more work to set up and the hardware is more expensive.

> [!Note]
> If your small business has lots of floor space, such as a manufacturing facility, you may experience signal degradation if there are very long cables between devices. You can often improve the signal by using an Ethernet repeater to strengthen the signal. To begin, follow the procedure for the version of Windows running on the device that you want to connect to your network. All of your devices don't need to run the same version of Windows to be a part of your business network.

### Connect the cables

To begin, run an Ethernet cable from the router or hub to each device that you want to connect to the network.

#### Install the network adapters

Windows can automatically detect and install the correct network adapter software for you.

To check whether your device has a network adapter, follow the instructions.

1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen (if using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen and move the mouse pointer down).

4. Select the device from the list that appears and click **Connect**.

## Install a wireless network

Now that you've decided to invest in a wireless network for your business, you have to select a network standard and set up your network. Wireless networks (WLANs) don't require much in the way of network infrastructure. Many small business owners select wireless networking because it's flexible, inexpensive, and easy to install and maintain. You can use a wireless network to share Internet access, files, printers, file servers, and other devices in your office. Once you have the network set up, you can enable sharing, set permissions, and add printers and other devices.

To begin, follow the procedure for the version of Windows running on the device that you want to connect to your network. All of your devices don't need to run the same version of Windows to be a part of your business network.

### Select a wireless network standard

The most common wireless network standards are 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11a, and 802.11n. Prices vary for each standard as do data transfer rates. Typically the faster the data transfer rate, the more you pay. In general, data transfer rates for each standard work as follows:

1. 802.11b ―11 Megabytes per second (Mbps)
2. 802.11g ― 54 Mbps
3. 802.11a ― 54 Mbps
4. 802.11n ― 300-600 Mbps

> [!Note]

## Create and manage workgroups

A workgroup is a group of devices that are connected to a home or small office network and share resources, such as printers and files. When you set up a network, Windows automatically creates a workgroup and gives it a name. In a workgroup:

- All devices are peers; no device has control over another device.
- Each device has a set of user accounts. To log on to any device in the workgroup, you must have an account set up on it.
- There are typically no more than 20 devices in a workgroup.
- A workgroup isn't protected by a password.
- All devices must be on the same local network or subnet. If your network includes devices running different versions of Windows, you should put all the devices in the same workgroup so that they can find one another and easily share files and printers.

## Install a hybrid network

A hybrid network refers to any computer network that contains two or more communications standards such Ethernet (802.3) and Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g). A hybrid network relies on special hybrid routers, hubs, and switches to connect both wired and wireless computers and other network-enabled devices. It enables the network to maximize the benefits of both these network types.

### Central access point

In a wired computer network, all devices are connected by physical cables to a central access point. This access point can be a router, hub, or a switch. The function of this access point is to share a network connection among several devices. All the devices are plugged into the access point using individual Ethernet (CAT 5) cables. If the devices need to share an Internet connection as well, then the access point is plugged into a broadband Internet modem, either cable or DSL.

In a standard wireless network, all networked devices communicate with a central wireless access point that broadcasts a signal. The devices themselves need to contain wireless modems or cards that conform with one or more Wi-Fi standards, either 802.11 a, b or g, to receive the signal. In this network configuration, all wireless devices can share files with each other over the network. If they also want to share an Internet connection, then the wireless access point is plugged into a broadband Internet modem.

A standard hybrid network uses a hybrid access point, a networking device that broadcasts a wireless signal and contains wired access ports. The most common hybrid access point is a hybrid router. The typical hybrid router broadcasts a Wi-Fi signal using 802.11 a, b, or g and contains four Ethernet ports for connecting wired devices. The hybrid router also has a port for connecting to a cable or DSL modem via an Ethernet cable.

When shopping for a hybrid router, you might not see the word "hybrid" anywhere. You're more likely to see the router advertised as a wireless or Wi-Fi router with Ethernet ports or "LAN ports".

After you determine which of your devices you want to connect with wires and which ones wirelessly, follow the procedures that are listed in **Install a wired network**, and **Install a wireless network** respectively to set up these parts of the hybrid network.

### Network configurations

There are several different possible network configurations for a hybrid network. The most basic configuration has all the wired devices plugged into the Ethernet ports of the hybrid router, and the wireless devices connected to the router wirelessly. Then the wireless devices can communicate with the wired devices via the hybrid router.

If you want to network more than four wired devices, you can string several routers together, both wired and wireless, in a daisy chain formation. You'll need enough wired routers to handle all of the wired devices (the number of devices divided by four). And you'll need enough wireless routers in the right physical locations to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal to every corner of the network. In this way, you can connect both computers and peripherals such as printers and fax machines and place them where it will easy to access them.

A hybrid wired/Wi-Fi network offers the best of both worlds: the speed and security of a wired network and the mobility and affordability of a wireless network. When you need the maximum Internet and file-sharing speed for your work, you can plug into the network with an Ethernet cable. If you need to show a streaming video to your colleague in the office hallway, you can access the network wirelessly. With the right planning, your small business can save money on CAT 5 cables and routers by maximizing the reach of the wireless network. And with the right encryption and password management in place, the wireless portion of the network can be as secure as the wired.

## Share files and folders on your network

After you set up your network, you might want to add more sharing options for your work and devices. Some of these options are set automatically, while others can be set manually.

Sharing options for your device include:

- Finding other devices on your home network and having other devices find yours
- Sharing files and folders
- Sharing public folders

### Sharing options that turn on automatically

In Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, when you connect to a network for the first time, you're given the option to turn on sharing and set the network location based upon your selection.

#### Sharing options that need to be turned on manually

If certain sharing options don't turn on automatically, you can activate them manually. These manual activation options include:

- Network discovery
- Network sharing (formerly location)
- Printer sharing
- File sharing

### Network discovery

Network discovery is a network setting that lets your device find other devices on the network and other devices find your device. Such functionality makes it easier to share files and printers.

There are three network discovery states:

- **On:** Enables your device to see other network devices and people on other network devices to see your device.
- **Off:** Prevents your device from seeing other network devices and prevents people on other network devices from seeing your device.
- **Custom:** Enables limited network discovery. For example, if you run network discovery without meeting all required firewall conditions, the network discovery state would be shown as Custom.

To manually activate network discovery, follow the instructions.

1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen (if using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen and move the mouse pointer down).
2. Tap or click **Search**.
3. Type *network and sharing center* in the Search box.
4. Tap or click **Settings**.
5. Tap or click **Network and Sharing Center** on the left side of your screen.
6. Tap or click **Change Advanced sharing settings** on the left pane.
7. Tap or click the chevron button to expand your current network profile.
8. Tap or click **Turn on network discovery** and then tap or click **Save changes**.
   > [!Note]
   > You might be asked for an administrator password or to confirm your choice.

### Network sharing (formerly network location)

Network sharing automatically adjusts security and other settings based on the type of network connected to your device. To check whether network sharing is enabled, follow the instructions.

The first time you connect to a network, you'll be asked if you want to turn on sharing between devices and connect to network devices such as printers. Your answer automatically sets the appropriate firewall and security settings for the type of network. You can turn sharing on or off at any time.

##### Turn sharing on or off in Windows 8.1 and Windows 8

1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen (if using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen and move the mouse pointer down).
2. Tap or click **Settings**.
3. Tap or click the **Network** icon.
4. Press and hold or right-click the network name.
5. Tap or click **Turn sharing on or off**.
6. Select one of the following options:  
   **Yes, turn on sharing and connect to devices.** Use this option for home or small office networks or when you know and trust the people and devices on the network.  
   **No, don't turn on sharing or connect to devices.** Use this option for networks in public places (such as coffee shops or airports), or when you don't know or trust the people and devices on the network.

> [!Note]
> - Network sharing is only available for Wi-Fi, Ethernet, VPN (non-domain), and dial-up (non-domain) connections. It's unavailable for domain networks. On VPN or dial-up connections, you must connect to the network first, then press and hold or right-click the network name.
> - Turning on sharing changes your firewall settings to enable some communication, which can be a security risk. If you know you won't need to share files or printers, the safest choice is **No, don't sharing or connect to devices**.
> - Choosing **No, don't turn on sharing or connect to devices** blocks the following apps and services from working:
>   1. PlayTo
>   2. File sharing
>   3. Network discovery
>   4. Automatic setup of network devices

#### Check the network location devices

There are four network locations you can use for Windows 7 devices:

- **Home.** The network offers some protection from the Internet (such as a router and firewall) and contains known or trusted devices. Network discovery is turned on automatically.

- **Work.** The network offers some protection from the Internet (such as a router and firewall) and contains known or trusted devices. Network discovery is turned on automatically. Most small business networks fall into this category.

- **Public.** The network is available for public use. Examples of public networks are public Internet access networks, such as those found in airports, libraries, and coffee shops. This network location helps keep your device from being seen by other devices around you and helps protect your device from malicious software on the Internet. You should also select this option if you're connected directly to the Internet without using a router or if you have a mobile broadband connection.
  > [!Note]
  > This is the safest setting, but you can't share printers or files.  

- **Domain.** The device is connected to a network that contains an Active Directory domain controller. A corporate network is one example of a domain network. This network location isn't available as an option. It must be set by the domain administrator.

This makes it possible for devices that are running different versions of Windows to detect and access one another. Remember that the default workgroup name is not the same in all versions of Windows.

### Password-protected sharing

With password-protected sharing, people on your network can't access shared folders on other devices, including Public folders, unless they have a user name and password on the device for shared folders.

With Windows XP, password protected sharing is turned on by default.

### Network map

The network map is a graphical view of the devices and devices on your network. The map shows how devices are connected and includes any problem areas. It can be helpful for troubleshooting.

If you want a device running Windows XP to appear on the network map, you might have to install the Link-Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol on that device.

If Windows XP devices still don't appear on the network map even after you install the LLTD protocol, check your Windows firewall settings and make sure that file and printer sharing is enabled. "To learn more about this issue, open **Help and Support** and search for *Enable file and printer sharing*". If you're using another firewall, see the information that was included with your firewall.
