# Slow network performance when you open a file that is located in a shared folder on a remote network computer

This article helps fix a slow network performance issue that can occur when you open a file that is located in a shared folder on a remote network computer.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 829700

## Symptoms

When you use Windows Explorer to connect to a shared folder on a remote computer on your network, and you double-click a file in that shared folder to open it, it may take a longer time than expected to open the file. For example, you may experience this issue when you open a Microsoft Office document over a slow connection, such as a 64-kilobits-per-second (kbps) Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) connection on a wide area network (WAN).

## Cause

This issue occurs because Windows Explorer tries to obtain detailed information about the remote share and about the file that you are opening. This operation may take a long time over a slow connection.

## Resolution

### Adding a Group Policy

Administrators can control which shell extensions can run by using the **Approved** key and the EnforceShellExtensionSecurity policy. The SuppressionPolicy value is tied to the EnforceShellExtensionSecurity policy. You can add this policy to enable the modified shell behavior.

To do this, follow these steps:  

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type Gpedit.msc, and then click **OK**.
2. Under **User Configuration** in the left pane, expand **Administrative Templates**, expand **Windows Components**, and then click **Windows Explorer**.
3. In the right pane, double-click **Allow only per user or approved shell extensions**, click **Enabled**, and then click **OK**.
