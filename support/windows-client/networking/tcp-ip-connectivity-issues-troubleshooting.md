This article provides a comprehensive guide for troubleshooting TCP/IP connectivity errors.

## Symptoms and analysis

You might encounter connectivity issues at the application level or might experience timeout errors. Here are some common scenarios:

- Application connectivity to a database server
- SQL timeout errors
- BizTalk application timeout errors
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) failures
- File share access failures
- General connectivity

When a network-related issue is suspected, we recommend collecting a network packet capture. This capture can be filtered to identify the problematic TCP connection and determine the cause of the failure.

During the troubleshooting process, you might encounter a TCP RESET in the network capture, which could indicate a network issue.

## Introduction of TCP

TCP is characterized as a connection-oriented and reliable protocol. It ensures reliability through the handshake process. A TCP session initiates with a three-way handshake, followed by data transfer, and concludes with a four-way closure.

- A four-way closure, where both the sender and receiver agree to close the session, is known as a graceful closure. This is identified by the FIN flag in the TCP header being set to 1.

- After the four-way closure, the machine waits for 4 minutes (by default) before releasing the port. This is termed as TIME_WAIT state. During this TIME_WAIT state, any pending packets for the TCP connection can be processed. Once the TIME_WAIT state completes, all resources allocated for the connection are released.  
- A TCP reset is an abrupt session closure, causing the immediate release of allocated resources and erasure of all connection information. This is identified by the RESET flag in the TCP header being set to 1. 
A network trace collected simultaneously on the source and the destination helps you to determine the flow of the traffic and identify the point of failure.

The following sections outline scenarios in which a RESET could occur.

## Packet loss over the network

When a TCP peer sends packets without receiving a response, the peer retransmits the data. If there's still no response, the session ends with an ACK RESET, indicating that the application acknowledges the exchanged data but closes the connection due to packet loss.

Simultaneous network traces at both the source and destination can verify this behavior. On the source side, you can see the retransmitted packets. On the destination side, these packets don't be present. This scenario indicates that a network device between the source and destination is dropping the packets.

### Scenario 1: Packet loss during initial TCP handshake

If the initial TCP handshake fails due to packet drops, the TCP SYN packet is retransmitted three times by default.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of times that the TCP SYN packet is retransmitted can be different based on the OS. This is determined by the value **Max SYN Retransmissions** under **TCP Global** parameters, which can be viewed using the command `netsh int tcp show global`.

Assume that a source machine with IP Address 10.10.10.1 is connecting to destination with IP Address 10.10.10.2 over TCP port 445. The following is a screenshot of the network trace collected on the source machine, which shows the initial TCP handshake wherein TCP SYN packet is sent and then retransmitted by the source since no response was received from destination.

The same TCP conversation seen in the network trace collected on the destination shows that none of the above packets were received by the destination. This implies that the TCP SYN packet was dropped over the intermediate network.

:::image type="content" source="media/tcp-ip-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting/destination-side-same-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot of frame summary with filter in Network Monitor.":::

If the TCP SYN packets are reaching the destination, but the destination doesn't response, verify whether the TCP port that is connected to is in the LISTENING state on destination machine. This can be checked in the output of the command `netstat -anob`.

If the port is listening and there's still no response, there could be a drop at the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP).

### Scenario 2: Packet loss during data transfer post TCP connection establishment

In a scenario where a data packet sent after the TCP connection is established gets dropped over the network, TCP retransmits the packet five times by default.

Assume that a source machine with IP Address 192.168.1.62 has established a connection with destination machine having IP Address 192.168.1.2 over TCP port 445. The source machine is sending data (SMB Negotiate packet) which is being retransmitted five times, as seen below. After no response from destination, the source machine is sending an ACK-RST to close this TCP connection.

Source 192.168.1.62 side trace:

:::image type="content" source="media/tcp-ip-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting/source-192-168-1-62.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing packet side trace.":::

You wouldn't see any of the above packets reaching the destination.

You need to engage your internal network team to investigate the different hops between the source and the destination, and check whether any of the hops are potentially causing packet drops.

## Incorrect parameter in the TCP header

This behavior occurs when intermediary devices in the network modify packets, causing TCP at the receiving end to reject them. For instance, the TCP sequence number might be altered, or packets could be replayed by an intermediary device with a modified TCP sequence number.

A simultaneous network trace on the source and destination can help identify any modifications to the TCP headers.

Begin by comparing the source and destination traces to detect any changes in the packets or the presence of new packets reaching the destination on behalf of the source.

In such cases, we recommend seeking assistance from the internal network team to identify any devices that are modifying or replaying packets to the destination. Common culprits include Riverbed devices or WAN accelerators.

## Application-level reset

When you have determined that the resets aren't due to packet drops, incorrect parameters, or packet modifications (as identified through network traces), you can conclude that the issue is an application-level reset.

Application-level resets are characterized by the Acknowledgment (ACK) flag being set to 1 along with the Reset (R) flag. This indicates that the server acknowledges the receipt of the packet, but doesn't accept the connection for some reason. This issue typically occurs when the application receiving the packet finds something unacceptable in the data.  

In the screenshots below, you can observe that the packets at both the source and destination are identical, with no modifications or drops. However, an explicit reset is sent by the destination to the source.

Source-side trace:

Destination-side trace:

:::image type="content" source="media/tcp-ip-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting/screenshot-of-packets-on-destination-side-in-network-monitor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of packets on destination side in Network Monitor.":::

An ACK+RST flagged TCP packet can also occur when a TCP SYN packet is sent out. The TCP SYN packet is initiated by the source machine to establish a connection on a specific port. However, if the destination server doesn't want to accept the packet for any reason, the server responds with an ACK+RST packet.

:::image type="content" source="media/tcp-ip-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting/ack-rst-flag-packet.png" alt-text="Screenshot of packet with ACK RSK flag.":::In such cases, it's essential to investigate the application causing the reset (identified by port numbers) to understand why the connection is being reset.

> [!NOTE]
> The above information pertains to resets from a TCP perspective and not UDP. UDP is a connectionless protocol, and packets are sent unreliably. Consequently, retransmissions or resets are not observed when using UDP as a transport protocol. However, UDP utilizes ICMP as an error reporting protocol. When a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not listed at the destination, the destination will immediately respond with an ICMP "**Destination Host Unreachable: Port Unreachable**" message.

```output
10.10.10.1  10.10.10.2  UDP UDP:SrcPort=49875,DstPort=3343
 
10.10.10.2  10.10.10.1  ICMP    ICMP:Destination Unreachable Message, Port Unreachable,10.10.10.2:3343
```

During the troubleshooting of TCP/IP connectivity issues, you may observe in the network trace that a machine receives packets but doesn't respond to them. This could indicate a drop at the destination server's network stack.

To determine whether the local Windows Firewall is dropping the packet, enable auditing for the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) on the machine using the following command.

```console
auditpol /set /subcategory:"Filtering Platform Packet Drop" /success:enable /failure:enable
```

You can then review the Security event logs to identify a packet drop on a specific TCP port and IP address, along with an associated WFP filter ID.

:::image type="content" source="media/tcp-ip-connectivity-issues-troubleshooting/security-event-log.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Event Properties with filter ID." border="false":::

Next, run the command `netsh wfp show state` which generates a *wfpstate.xml* file.

You can open this file by using Notepad and filter for the ID found in the event logs (for example, 2944008 in the sample event). The result reveals the firewall rule name associated with the Filter ID that is blocking the connection.
