# Windows Security Alert appears when connecting to a wireless network on a workgroup machine

This article helps fix an issue where a Windows Security alert appears when you connect to a wireless network on a workgroup machine.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2518158

## Symptoms

While connecting to a wireless network on a Windows system that is part of a workgroup, a Windows Security Alert dialog similar to the following may be displayed:  
> The server `<Authentication server>` presented a valid certificate issued by `<CA name>`, but `<CA name>` is not configured as a valid trust anchor for this profile. Further, the server `<Authentication server>` is not configured as a valid NPS server to connect to this profile.  

or  

> The server `<Authentication server>` presented a valid certificate issued by `<CA name>`, but `<CA name>` is not configured as a valid trust anchor for this profile.  

If you click the Connect button on the dialog box, the wireless connection will be established successfully.  

## Cause

To validate the server certificate, Windows will check if the second element in the chain, the Certification Authority (CA) that issued the end certificate, is a trusted CA for Windows NT Authentication. A CA is considered to be trusted if it exists in the `NTAuth` system registry store found in the `CERT_SYSTEM_STORE_LOCAL_MACHINE_ENTERPRISE` store location. If this verification fails, either of the warning messages in the Symptoms section could occur. By default, the CA certificate is not in the NTAuth store on a Windows system that is part of a workgroup.

## Resolution  

To work around the issue, you can export the certificate of the CA that issued the certificate to the authentication server to a file. Copy the file to the workgroup machine and then run the following command from an elevated Command Prompt:

`certutil -enterprise -addstore NTAuth CA_CertFilename.cer`
