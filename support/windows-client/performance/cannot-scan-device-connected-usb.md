# Can't scan from a scanning device connected through USB to a USB-zero-client-connected station

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a server that is running Windows Multipoint Server 2011.
- A scanning device is connected through USB to a USB-zero-client-connected station.
- You select **Scan from device or camera** from a scan application such as Microsoft Paint.

In this scenario, you receive an error message that resembles the following:

> Unable to retrieve picture from device. Verify the device is properly connected and try again.

Additionally, Windows Multipoint Server might restart unexpectedly from a Stop 0x3B error if the scanning device is connected directly to a USB port on the server. In this case, an event similar to the following is logged in Event Viewer under **Windows Logs** > **System**:

```output
