This article provides a solution to a reboot loop issue that's caused by changing the ATA Drive setting.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 8  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2751461

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You boot into the BIOS and changed the ATA setting from ATA Mode to AHCI Mode pressed enter to accept the change.
- You click Yes to the Warning about the detected mode change on the embedded ATA controller.
- You restart the computer and boot normally.
In this scenario, during the system boot when Windows tries to start, you will receive an error with regards to a system failure. The system will be stuck in a reboot loop.

5. Open an elevated command prompt and run the following command to enable SafeMode boot:
bcdedit /set {current} safeboot minimal
6. Restart the computer and boot to the system BIOS.
7. Change the ATA Drive setting from ATA Mode to AHCI Mode, press enter to accept the change.
8. Click Yes to the Warning about the detected mode change on the embedded ATA controller.
