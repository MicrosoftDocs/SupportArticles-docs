# Windows 10 causes issues when it calls CreateWindowEx in some 32-bit applications

This article provides a workaround for an issue in which Windows 10 causes issues when it calls CreateWindowEx in some 32-bit applications.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1803, Windows 10, version 1709  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4054150

## Symptoms

In some cases, the Windows 10 causes crashes or other issues when it calls the **CreateWindowEx** function in some 32-bit applications. We are aware of issues that affect some Microsoft Visual Studio extensions and the Bloomberg Professional service.

To determine whether your system is running Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (Version 1709, build 16299.19 or 16299.15), select **Start**, select **Settings**, select **System**, select **About**, and then look under **Windows specifications**  for the Windows version information.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, roll back your Windows 10 installation to the previous version.

The roll back option is available for 10 days after you've upgraded your Windows 10 installation. To roll back, select **Start**, select **Settings**, select **Update & Security**, and then select **Recovery**. This keeps your personal files, but removes applications and drivers that were installed after the upgrade, and also reverses any changes that you made to settings.

If the roll back option isn't available, please contact your IT support or helpdesk for help to restore the computer to the previous Window 10 version.

We recommend that you make a backup of your personal files before you contact your IT support, helpdesk, or [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).

## Status

Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.
