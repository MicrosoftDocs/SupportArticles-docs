# SuperFetch(SysMain) service spikes the CPU for 1-2 minutes when a 64-bit application is running in Windows

This article provides a workaround for an issue where the system experiences CPU spike for 1-2 minutes when a 64-bit application runs in the 64-bit version of Windows.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp;Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;2723033

## Symptoms

When a 64-bit application compiled with /LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO option is running in the 64-bit versions of Windows, the system may experience CPU spike for 1-2 minutes and this goes on in-definitely. In this situation, the Task Manager shows the svchost.exe process hosting the SysMain(SuperFetch) service is consuming the CPU utilization.

## Cause

Windows creates a single read-only Virtual Address Descriptor (VAD) for the address space above 2 GB while creating the process. SuperFetch while scanning the VAD tree of the running process encounters the VAD and spins with the huge VAD size, causing the CPU to spike.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, avoid option /LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO while compiling the applications.

> [!Note]
> By default a 64-bit application makes use of the Extended Address Space (8 terabytes per process).
