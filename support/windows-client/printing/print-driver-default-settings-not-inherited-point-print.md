# Print driver default settings are not inherited through "Point and Print" in Windows 10 Version 1709

This article provides a solution to the issue in which print driver default settings are not inherited through "Point and Print" in Windows 10 Version 1709.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, version 1709  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4052855

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You have a client that is running Windows 10 Version 1709 or Windows Server Version 1709.
- You have a print server that is running Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows Server 2008 R2.
- You install printer drivers by using the "Point and Print" process.

In this scenario, the client does not inherit default settings from the print server.

## Resolution

To fix this issue, set the printer settings manually on the client following these steps:

1. Right-click the **Start** button, and then select **Settings**.
2. Select **Devices**.
3. In the center of the **Devices** window, select **Devices and printers**.
4. In the **Devices and Printers**  window, right-click the icon of a printer that you installed from the server computer. Then, select **Printing preferences**.
    > [!Note]
    > The **Printing Preferences** dialog box opens.
5. In the dialog box, select the **Advanced**  button.
    > [!Note]
    > The **Advanced Options** dialog box opens. You can change the printer settings in this dialog box.

## Status
