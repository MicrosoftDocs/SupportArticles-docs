## Symptoms

When a 32-bit TWAIN aware application scans using a WIA driver on a 64-bit Windows Vista or Windows 7 system, the TWAIN application may stop responding.

## Cause

If you leave the scan dialog open for about 10 minutes before you push the [Scan] button, the message used to transfer the scanned image from the WIA driver to the TWAIN application is not sent to the TWAIN application.

## Resolution

This problem can be avoided by doing either of the followings:

- Scan image soon after you open the scan dialog.

- Use a WIA aware application, not a TWAIN aware application.

## More information

This behavior is by design.
