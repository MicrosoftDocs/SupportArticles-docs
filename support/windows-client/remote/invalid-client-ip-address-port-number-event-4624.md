# Invalid client IP address in security event ID 4624 in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2

This article provides a resolution to an issue where event 4624 and an invalid client IP address and port number are generated when a client computer tries to access a host computer that's running RDP 8.0.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3097467

## Symptoms

Assume that the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 8.0 update for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 (KB2592687) is installed and enabled through policy settings. When a user's remote desktop logs on to that computer, security event ID 4624 is logged and shows an invalid client IP address and port number, as follows:

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe. The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network). The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on. The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

## Cause

This issue occurs because of a code change in RDP 8.0. In RDP 8.0, the client IP address is stored in a WTS_SOCKADDR structure. This differs from RDP 7.0 (the default RDP version in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2).

In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 (and later versions of Windows), the code logic for logging this event is rewritten based on the new design. That prevents this issue from occurring.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, upgrade the RDP target computer to Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012 (or later). Or, disable RDP 8.0 in Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2.

## More information

You may also encounter this issue if you're using a third-party RDP component to log on to Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 when that third-party component uses the same WTS_SOCKADDR structure. In this situation, consider upgrading the OS, or contact the component provider for assistance.
