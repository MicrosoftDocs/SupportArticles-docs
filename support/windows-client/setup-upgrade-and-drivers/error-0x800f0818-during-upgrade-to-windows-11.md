# "0x800F0818 - 0x20003" error during upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11

This article provides a solution for an error that occurs on some computers when you upgrade them from Windows 10 to Windows 11.

## Symptoms

You use one of the following systems to service Windows client computers:

- System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
- Windows Update for Business

A feature update from Windows 10 22H2 to Windows 11 23H2 or 24H2 fails in the Safe_OS phase, and generates error 0x800F0818 - 0x20003. After the failure occurs, the update rolls back.

If you run a diagnostic tool such as [SetupDiag](/windows/deployment/upgrade/setupdiag), the tool returns the same error code.

An error entry is logged in the C:\\$Windows.~BT\\Sources\\Rollback\\setupact_rollback.log file that contains text that resembles the following excerpt:

```output
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, Info MOUPG InitializeRoutine: MOSETUP_ACTION_IMAGE_EXIT
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, Info MOUPG ImageExit: Initializing SetupResult: [0x800f0818]

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, Info MOUPG ImageExit: Initializing PostReboot: [TRUE]
```

Additionally, multiple error entries are logged in the C:\\$Windows.~BT\\Sources\\Panther\\setupact.log file. The contents of these entries resemble the following excerpts:

```output

```

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, Info CBS Failed to check capability logic [HRESULT = 0x800f0818 - CBS_E_IDENTITY_MISMATCH]
```

## Cause

This issue affects devices that have one of the following histories:

- The device previously received a Windows 10 feature update that used a custom SetupConfig.ini file.
- Earlier updates or upgrades to the device used language packs or post-upgrade scripts that were manually configured or deployed.

The upgrade failed because of a legacy SetupConfig.ini file that contains hard-coded paths to outdated language packs and scripts. Those language packs and scripts aren't compatible with Windows 11. The path to the legacy file typically is C:\Users\Default\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WSUS\SetupConfig.ini. The contents of the file resemble the following excerpt:

```output
[SetupConfig]
InstallLangPacks=C:\ProgramData\Temp\Inplaceupgrade\W10_22H2\LP
PostOOBE=C:\ProgramData\Temp\Inplaceupgrade\W10_22H2\Scripts\SetupComplete.cmd
PostRollback=C:\ProgramData\Temp\Inplaceupgrade\W10_22H2\Scripts\ErrorHandler.cmd
DynamicUpdate=Disable
```

These outdated references cause identity mismatches during the upgrade process. Therefore, the upgrade fails and rolls back.

## Resolution

[!INCLUDE [Important registry alert](../../../includes/registry-important-alert.md)]

To remove the legacy information, follow these steps:

1. On the affected computer, open File Explorer, and then go to C:\\Users\\Default\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WSUS\\.
   > [!NOTE]  
   > If you can't see the AppData folder, select **View** > **Show**, then select **Hidden items** to view hidden files and folders.

1. Delete the SetupConfig.ini file.

1. Open Registry Editor, and then go to the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup` subkey.

1. Delete the `UnattendFile` registry entry.
