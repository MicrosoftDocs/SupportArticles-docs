1. On the **Tools** menu, select **Options**.
2. Select the **Player** tab, select the **Download codecs automatically** check box, and then select **OK**.
3. Try to play the file.

If you're prompted to install the codec, select **Install**. If you still can't play the file correctly, try the steps in the **Advanced troubleshooting** section.

### Advanced troubleshooting

The following steps are intended for advanced computer users.

Obtain and install the codec by following these steps in Windows Media Player 11:

1. Determine whether the codec is installed on the computer that you are using to play the file. To do so, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Now Playing** area, right-click the file that you try to play, and then select **Properties**.
    2. Select the **File** tab, note the codecs that are specified in the **Audio codec** and the **Video codec** areas, and then select **OK**. If the following conditions are true, go to step 2.
        - No audio codec is specified.
        - No video codec is specified.
    3. On the **Help** menu, select **About Windows Media Player**.
    4. Select the **Technical Support Information** hyperlink.
    5. If you're trying to play an audio file, determine whether the audio codec that you noted in step 1b is listed in the **Audio Codecs** area. If you are trying to play a video file, determine whether the video codec or the audio codec that you noted in step 1b is listed in the **Video Codecs** area. If the codec isn't listed, go to step 2.
    6. Try to reinstall the codec. If you can't reinstall the codec, go to step 2.
    7. Try to play the file. If you can play the file, skip steps 2 and 3.

2. Install the codec by following these steps:

    1. If you receive an error message when you try to play the file, select **Web Help**. If you don't receive an error message when you try to play the file, go to step 3.
    2. On the Microsoft Web site, select the link to the Wmplugins Web site.

    3. Follow the instructions on the Web site to download and install the codec for the file. If the Web site doesn't automatically find a codec for the file, and if either of the following conditions is true, go to step 3:
          - You didn't note a codec in step 1b.
          - You can't find the codec that you noted in step 1b on the Web site.
    4. Try to play the file. If you can play the file, skip step 3.

3. Obtain the codec from a third-party vendor.
