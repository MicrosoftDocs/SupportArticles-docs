# Pre-installed Microsoft Store app is removed unexpectedly at first Windows logon

This article provides a workaround for the issue in which a pre-installed Microsoft Store App is unexpectedly removed the first time that a user logs on.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1903, Windows 10, version 1809  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4543142

## Symptoms

You use a DISM command to deploy a Microsoft Store app in Windows 10, version 1809 or a later version of Windows, and then you deploy the app on a computer. After a user logs on to the computer for the first time, the app is unexpectedly removed. Additionally, an Event ID 240 error is generated.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, add the `/Region:"All"` switch when you use the DISM command to deploy the app.
