# Troubleshoot Apps failing to start using Windows Package Manager

This article describes how to install Windows Package Manager to troubleshoot the issue in which Modern, Inbox, and Microsoft Store Apps fail to start.

## Prerequisites

- A computer running Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- Administrator privileges.
- A network connection.

> [!NOTE]
> The WinGet client requires Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763), or later versions. Windows Server 2019 isn't supported because Microsoft Store and other dependencies aren't available for Windows Server.

If you're already running Windows 10, version 1809, or later versions, the client may already be available on your system. Check if the winget tool is available by invoking the `winget` command at the command prompt or Windows PowerShell.

1. Open the Start menu, enter *PowerShell*, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
2. In PowerShell, run the `winget` cmdlet to check if the app is installed.

In the above example, invoking the cmdlet states that `winget` isn't recognized, which means it isn't installed on the system.

## How to install the winget tool

There are two ways to install the winget tool:

- From Microsoft Store.
- Manually, using a package installer from GitHub.

### Method 1: Install the winget tool from Microsoft Store

3. Select **Get** to install the app on the **App Installer** page, and wait for the installation to finish.
4. Verify the installation by invoking the `winget` command at the command prompt or in Windows PowerShell. The output shows the program version, syntax, and available options as follows:
