The Windows Search 4.0 installation process automatically upgrades Windows Desktop Search (WDS) 2.6 and later versions of WDS. If you are running a version of WDS that is earlier than WDS 2.6, use the **Add or Remove Programs** tool to remove the earlier version before you install Windows Search 4.0.

> [!NOTE]
> To install Windows Search 4.0 successfully on a computer that is running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, Terminal Services must be running on the computer. Also, Terminal Services must be running for Windows Search 4.0 to function correctly. By default, Terminal Services is configured to start automatically. However, it may have been disabled manually or by third-party software. If Terminal Services is disabled, the installation of Windows Search 4.0 will fail with error code 643.

To determine the status of Terminal Services, and start the service if it is disabled, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type *services.msc*, and then press ENTER.
2. Locate Terminal Services.
3. If the **Status** of the service is not set to **Started**, right-click the service, and then click **Properties**.
4. In the **Startup type** list, click **Automatic**, click **Apply**, and then click **Start**.

> [!NOTE]
> If the installation of Windows Search 4.0 was not successful because Terminal Services was disabled on the computer, you can now restart the installation of Windows Search 4.0.
