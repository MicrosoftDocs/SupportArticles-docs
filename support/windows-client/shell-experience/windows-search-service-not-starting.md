# Windows Search service not starting with Windows Search service on local computer started and then stopped error

This article provides a resolution to solve the error that occurs when you try to start the Windows Search Service.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2484025

## Symptoms

Windows Search service doesn't start and when you try to start the service manually, you receive this error message:

> ========  
Services  
\========  
"The Windows Search service on local computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs"  
\===  
OK  
\===

## Cause

You may see this issue if there are missing subkeys or registry entries under the following registry location:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search\CrawlScopeManager\Windows\SystemIndex`

Or if there are corrupted log files at the following location:

C:\windows\system32\config\TxR

> [!NOTE]
> The above regisrty key is unique to each machine, so should not be replaced manually.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, delete all files with `.BLF` and `.REGTRANS-MS` extension in the following directory:

C:\windows\system32\config\TxR  

> [!NOTE]
> The files in the folder location above are hidden and will thus not be visible unless you set the system to not Hide Protected Operating System Files under **Tools** > **Folder Options**.

Once these files are deleted, reboot the machine. Once rebooted, observe that the Windows Search service has already started and is in process of rebuilding the Index.

> [!IMPORTANT]
You may observe High CPU while the Search Index is being rebuilt.
