# How to use registry entries to configure standalone WMI providers

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 11

## Symptoms

You experience a quota overflow error in a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) shared provider host process (WMIPrvSE.exe).

## Resolution

The typical resolution for a WMIPrvSE.exe quota overflow is to configure standalone WMI providers. This custom configuration doesn't require administrative permissions.

In the past, you had to manually configure the providers. However, this article discusses a way to script these changes.

### Previous resolution: Manually configure providers

To configure standalone providers, you previously had to run the following manual steps by using a Windows PowerShell script or command prompt:

1. Stop the existing suspect WMIPrvSE.exe process to clean the memory that's set in the proportional set size (PSS). To do this, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   kill -f <pid of suspect wmiprvse.exe process>
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > In this command, \<*pid of suspect wmiprvse process*> represents the process ID (PID) of the Wmiprvse.exe process that generated the issue.

1. Use the `OWN` HostingmodelGroup to move the target working provider away from the suspect provider host. (Typically, this is a WMIPrvSE.exe share that's set as `HostingModel='NetworkserviceHost'`.) To do this, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   $prv = gcim -namespace root/standardcimv2 __win32provider -filter "name=<providername>"
   $prv.HostingModel = $Prv.HostingModel + ":OWN"
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > In this command, \<*providername*> represents the name of the target working provider.

1. To set the new name, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   set-ciminstance -inputobject $prv
   ```

## New resolution

The new method for resolving this issue resembles the method that's discussed in [Registry Keys and Values for Controlling Provider Security: Secure and compatible modes](/windows/win32/wmisdk/registry-keys-for-controlling-provider-security-#secure-and-compatible-modes). This method involves creating a new registry subkey that contains entries that represent a list of the providers that require standalone hosting.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you have configured the provider security registry entries to run in secure or compatible mode, Windows ignores the **StandaloneProvider** entries.

The registry information uses the following structure:

- Subkey: **HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wbem\CIMOM\StandaloneProviders**
- Entries (one per provider):
  - Name: ***Namespace*:__*TargetRelPath***
    > [!NOTE]  
    > In this string, *Namespace* represents the namespace of the target provider and *TargetRelPath* represents the relative path of the target provider. For example, **root\cimv2:__win32provider.name="MyProvider"**.
  - Value: ***Integer***
    > [!NOTE]  
    > In this string, *Integer* represents a unique numeric index that identifies the provider.

You can use Registry Editor to manually configure the registry, or you can use a PowerShell script.

The following example script configures the registry information for the **StorageWMI** provider. In this example, index value for the provider is **50**.

```powershell
$registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wbem\CIMOM\StandaloneProviders"
$Name = "ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/storage __win32provider.name='StorageWMI'"
$value = "50"
IF(!(Test-Path $registryPath))
  {
    New-Item -Path $registryPath -Force | Out-Null
    New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $name -Value $value -PropertyType String -Force | Out-Null
}
ELSE
{
    New-ItemProperty -Path $registryPath -Name $name -Value $value -PropertyType String -Force | Out-Null
}
```

This script checks whether the subkey exists. If the subkey doesn't exist, the script creates it. Then, it creates the subordinate entry for **StorageWMI**. After the script makes this change, the provider runs in the standalone configuration, and the provider's hosting group information includes a string that resembles the following text:

```console
:OWNStorageWMI50
```

The following image shows how this listing appears in a list of providers.
