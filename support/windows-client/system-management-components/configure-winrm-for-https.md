# How to configure WINRM for HTTPS

This article provides a solution to configuring WINRM for HTTPS.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2019527

## Summary

By default WinRM uses Kerberos for authentication so Windows never sends the password to the system requesting validation. To get a list of your authentication settings, type the following command:

```console
winrm get winrm/config
```

The purpose of configuring WinRM for HTTPS is to encrypt the data being sent across the wire.

WinRM HTTPS requires a local computer Server Authentication certificate with a CN matching the hostname to be installed. The certificate mustn't be expired, revoked, or self-signed.

To install or view certificates for the local computer:

1. Select **Start** and then select **Run** (or using keyboard combination press Windows key+R)ã€‚
2. Type *MMC* and then press Enter.
3. Select **File** from menu options and then select **Add or Remove Snap-ins**.
4. Select **Certificates** and select **Add**.
5. Go through the wizard selecting **Computer account**.
6. Install or view the certificates under **Certificates (Local computer)** > **Personal** > **Certificates**.

If you don't have a Server Authenticating certificate, consult your certificate administrator. If you have a microsoft Certificate server, you may be able to request a certificate using the web certificate template from `HTTPS://<MyDomainCertificateServer>/certsrv`.

Once the certificate is installed type the following to configure WINRM to listen on HTTPS:

```console
winrm quickconfig -transport:https
```

If you don't have an appropriate certificate, you can run the following command with the authentication methods configured for WinRM. However, the data won't be encrypted.

```console
winrm quickconfig
```

## More information

By default WinRM HTTP uses port 80. On Windows 7 and higher, the default port is 5985.

By default WinRM HTTPS uses port 443. On Windows 7 and higher, the default port is 5986.

To confirm WinRM is listening on HTTPS, type the following command:

```console
winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener
```

To confirm a computer certificate has been installed, use the Certificates MMC add-in or type the following command:

```console
Winrm get http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/config
```

If you get the following error message:  

> Error number: -2144108267 0x80338115  
ProviderFault  
WSManFault  
Message = Cannot create a WinRM listener on HTTPS because this machine does not have an appropriate certificate.

To be used for SSL, a certificate must have a CN matching the hostname, be appropriate for Server Authentication, and not be expired, revoked, or self-signed.

Open the certificates MMC add-in and confirm the following attributes are correct:

- The date of the computer falls between the **Valid from:** to the **To:** date on the **General** tab.
- Host name matches the **Issued to:** on the **General** tab, or it matches one of the **Subject Alternative Name** exactly as displayed on the **Details** tab.
- That the **Enhanced Key Usage** on the **Details** tab contains **Server authentication**.
- On the **Certification Path** tab that the **Current Status** is **This certificate is OK**.

If you have more than one local computer account server certificate installed, confirm the Certificate Thumbprint displayed by `Winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener` is the same Thumbprint on the **Details** tab of the certificate.
