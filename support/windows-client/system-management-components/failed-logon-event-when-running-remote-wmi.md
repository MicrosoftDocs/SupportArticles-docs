_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2816192

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You've two or more computers running Windows.
- The computers are set up in a workgroup or domain environment.
- You run a remote WMI query using an application that makes WMI calls from one computer to another computer.

In this scenario, if you review the Security log on the remote computer, you'll notice an Event ID 4625 that's for a failed logon with bad username or password. You'll also note then there's a successful logon with the credentials specified on the remote WMI query.

## Cause

The pass-through authentication is always attempted first, even if specific credentials are specified in the tool being used.

## Resolution

You can safely ignore the error message.
