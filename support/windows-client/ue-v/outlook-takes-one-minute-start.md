# Unexpected one-minute startup of Outlook if UE-V is enabled

This article helps resolve an issue where you experience an unexpected one-minute delay for Outlook to start if UE-V is enabled in Windows 10, version 1809 or a later version of Windows.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 â€“ all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4569308

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You're using Outlook 2019 or Outlook 2016 on a computer that is running Windows 10, version 1809 or a later version of Windows.
- You install a cumulative update for Windows 10 that is released after March 17, 2020.
- You deploy User Experience Virtualization (UE-V) that has the **Sync Method** set to **None**.
- You register the MicrosoftOutlook2016CAWinXX.xml UE-V template. For example, you register MicrosoftOutlook2016CAWin32.xml.

In this scenario, Outlook takes one minute to start and display its splash screen.

## Cause

This issue occurs when the **UE-V Sync** method is set to **None**. This setting causes Windows to ignore the synchronize timeout (by default, two seconds). Therefore, UE-V times out after one minute.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

### Method 1

Use the default Sync method **SyncProvider.**  

The Sync method **None** is specific to workstations that have a permanent network connection to the **SettingsStoragePath**.

### Method 2

Download and replace the version 3 of the Outlook custom action UEV template from the download center [UE-V OutlookCA template update](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=102259)
