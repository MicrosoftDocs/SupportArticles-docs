# Renaming a user account doesn't automatically change the profile path

This article provides a workaround for an issue where renaming a user account doesn't automatically change the profile path.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2454362

## Summary

When you rename a user account in on a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, the user profile path isn't changed automatically. It may cause some confusion when the `%SystemDrive%\users` folder is viewed

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed it to be by design in Windows.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use the steps below to manually rename the profile path.

1. Log in by using another administrative account.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may need create a new administrative account at first.

2. Go to the `C:\users\` folder and rename the sub folder with the original user name to the new user name.

3. Go to registry and modify the registry value **ProfileImagePath** to the new path name.

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\<User SID>\`

    > [!WARNING]
    > If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

4. Log out and log in again by using the user whose name is changed, and the user should use the pervious profile with new path name.
