## Cause

This issue occurs because Windows 10 enforces a policy that configures Vmcompute.exe not to allow any non-Microsoft DLL files to be loaded.

## Resolution

Vmcompute.exe process. One possible cause of this issue is your antivirus software.

To do this, you may use some tools such as process explorer. Follow these steps:

1. Download [Process Explorer](/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).
2. Extract the tool, and run ProcessExp64.exe, which is for 64-bit operating system.
3. Under **View** menu, select **Show Lower Pane**, click **Lower Pane View**, and then select **DLLs**.

4. Select the Vmcompute.exe process, and check for non-Microsoft DLLs in the lower pane. It is fine for some entries to be blank.
