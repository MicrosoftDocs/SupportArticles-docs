      Either the Windows product key or the ESU product key (or both) is installed on the device but isn't activated.

      #### Actions to take

      Activate the Windows product key or the ESU product key (or both) and try to install the ESU package.  

      ### HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(1633), Windows key out of range of Windows Embedded keys  

      You have a device with a Windows product key that doesn't fall within the range of keys defined for embedded editions of Windows. When you install an ESU update, some of the updates don't install and the CBS log contains entries similar to the following example:

      ```output
      ESU: Windows is not activated.  
      ESU: not eligible:HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(1633)  
      ```

      For example, you see the following log entries.

      :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-extended-security-updates-issues/log-entries-out-range.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example CBS log entries for Windows key out of range of Windows Embedded keys, which contains the output above.":::

      #### Possible cause

      The ESU product key is installed on the computer but isn't activated.

      #### Actions to take

      Activate the ESU product key, and then try to install the ESU package again.

      Maintaining ongoing ESU compliance
    answer: |
      You notice a non-compliant device in your update management and compliance toolsets.  

      If you have a subset of devices that are running Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 without ESU, you notice a non-compliant device in your update management and compliance toolsets.

      Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) continues to scan cab files for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1.
