          WININET_E_DECODING_FAILED  
          Content decoding has failed  
          
          #### Cause

          This issue may occur if TLS 1.0 is disabled and the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrenteControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\Schannel\Protocols\TLS 1.0\Client` subkey is set as follows:
          
          - DisabledByDefault: 1
          - Enabled: 0
          
          #### Actions to take

          This method forces the activation process to use TLS 1.2 by default so that TLS 1.0 can remain disabled.
          
          To resolve this issue, follow these steps.
          
          1. If update [3140245](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3140245) isn't installed on the computer, use Windows Update to install it.

      - question: |
          Installing ESU
        answer: |
          You may experience the following problems when you install an ESU update on a computer. This section assumes that the computer has all of the prerequisite updates for ESU, and the product activation key is installed and activated.

          ### The Windows Module Installer must be updated before you can install the package

          When you install an ESU update, you see a message similar to the following example:
          
          > Windows Update Standalone Installer  
          The Windows Modules Installer must be updated before you can install this package. Please update the Windows Modules Installer on your computer, then retry Setup.
          
          #### Possible cause  

          The Servicing Stack Update (SSU) with AI Changes package isn't installed on the computer.

          #### Actions to take  

          Verify that the SSU package is installed on the computer. To do so, on the affected computer, select **Start** > **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Program and Features** > **View Installed updates**.
          
          If the SSU package isn't installed, install it and restart the computer. For more information about this update, see the "Installation prerequisites" section of [Obtaining Extended Security Updates for eligible Windows devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/obtaining-extended-security-updates-for-eligible-windows-devices/ba-p/1167091#).
          
          #### Additional steps  

          If the preceding steps don't resolve the problem, on the affected computer, copy the component-based servicing (CBS) log file (C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log). Contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/), and provide this log file.  
          
          ### Some updates weren't installed while trying to install the security update

          When you install an ESU update, you see a message similar to the following example:
          
          > Download and Install Updates
          Some updates were not installed
          For information about other error codes, refer to the [Windows Update](/windows/deployment/update/windows-update-error-reference) error reference.
          
          #### Possible causes

          This problem may occur under any of the following conditions:
          
          - A valid ESU key isn't installed on the computer.​
          - On a desktop client or server, the ESU key is installed but isn't activated.​
          - On a Windows Embedded device, see [Windows Embedded devices](#windows-embedded-devices) for possible causes.​
          - The Windows operating system that is installed on the computer isn't in the list of ESU supported editions or architectures. For a list of the supported editions and architectures, see [Obtaining Extended Security Updates for eligible Windows devices](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/obtaining-extended-security-updates-for-eligible-windows-devices/ba-p/1167091#).
          
          #### Actions to take

          On a desktop client or server computer, follow these steps to verify that the computer has a valid ESU key installed and activated.
          
          1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window and then run one of the following commands:
             - `slmgr /dlv`  (Windows 7 only)
             - `slmgr /dlv <Activation ID>`  
                  > [!Note]
                  > In this command, **\<Activation ID>**  represents the activation ID of the ESU key that is installed on the computer.
          
             - `slmgr /dlv all`  
          
          2. In the command output, verify that ESU key is licensed.  
          
              ​:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-extended-security-updates-issues/esu-key-licensed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example output of the command, which shows ESU key is licensed.":::
          
              On a typical (non-embedded) computer, install the ESU key if you haven't already done so. Then activate the key by using one of the following methods:
          
              - [VAMT online or proxy activation](/windows/deployment/volume-activation/install-configure-vamt)
              - Phone activation​
              - By using the `slmgr /ato` command. To do so, follow these steps:
          
                  1. Open an elevated Command Prompt window.
                  2. Run `slmgr /ipk <ESU key>` and wait for the success message.
                     > [!Note]
                     > In this command, **\<ESU key>** represents the ESU product key for the computer.
          
          3. Run `slmgr /ato <Activation ID>`.
          
          On a Windows Embedded device, see [Windows Embedded devices](#windows-embedded-devices) for appropriate actions to take.​
          
          #### Additional steps

          If the preceding steps don't resolve the problem, on the affected computer, copy the component-based servicing (CBS) log file (C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log). Contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus/), and provide this log file.
