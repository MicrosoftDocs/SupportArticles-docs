      - question: |
          Is Windows 7 Year 1 ESU included with Microsoft 365 E5?
        answer: |
          Yes. Starting March 1, 2020, Microsoft is introducing a new program that includes Windows 7 Year 1 ESU together with Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 E5 Security, and Microsoft 365 Security + Compliance Subscription License.       
          
      - question: |
          In this new program, which subscriptions include Windows 7 Year 1 ESU?
        answer: |
          - Microsoft 365 E5
          - Microsoft 365 E5 Security
          - Microsoft 365 Security + Compliance Subscription License (SL)

      - question: |
          Who can take advantage of this program?
        answer: |
          Windows 7 Year 1 ESU combined with Microsoft 365 E5 is available to Volume Licensing (VL) customers who purchase through EA or EAS agreements.

      - question: |
          What are the effective dates of this program?
        answer: |
          March 1, 2020 - December 31, 2020.

      - question: |
          Do customers have to maintain Microsoft 365 E5 subscriptions throughout the ESU coverage period?
        answer: |
          Yes. Customers must maintain the qualifying E5 SKUs through the end of the Windows 7 Year 1 ESU period (January 12, 2021) to benefit from the included ESU.

      - question: |
          Why is only Windows 7 Year 1 ESU included?
        answer: |
          We believe that most customers who have to purchase Windows 7 ESU require only Year 1 coverage as they continue to deploy Windows 10.
