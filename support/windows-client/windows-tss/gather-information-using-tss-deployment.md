# Gather information by using TSS for deployment-related issues

This article introduces how to gather information by using the TroubleShootingScript (TSS) toolset for deployment-related issues.

Before contacting Microsoft support, you can gather information about your issue.

## Prerequisites

Refer to [Introduction to TroubleShootingScript toolset (TSS)](introduction-to-troubleshootingscript-toolset-tss.md#prerequisites) for prerequisites for the toolset to run properly.

## Gather key information before contacting Microsoft support

1. Download [TSS](https://aka.ms/getTSS) and extract it in the *C:\\tss* folder.
2. Open the *C:\\tss* folder from an elevated PowerShell command prompt.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Don't use the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
3. Run the following cmdlets:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
    ```

    ```powershell
    .\TSS.ps1 -Collectlog DND_SetupReport
    ```

4. Enter *A* for "Yes to All" for the execution policy change.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The traces are stored in a compressed file in the *C:\\MS_DATA* folder. After a support case is created, this file can be uploaded to the secure workspace for analysis.
> - If you've downloaded this tool previously, we recommend downloading the latest version. It doesn't automatically update when running `-Collectlog DND_SetupReport`.
