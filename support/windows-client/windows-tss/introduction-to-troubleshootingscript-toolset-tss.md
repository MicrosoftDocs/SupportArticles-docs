# Introduction to TroubleShootingScript toolset (TSS)

This article introduces the TroubleShootingScript (TSS) toolset and provides answers to frequently asked questions.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Supported versions of Windows Server and Windows Client

The TSS toolset includes PowerShell-based tools and a framework for data collection and diagnostics. The toolset aims to simplify data collection and help resolve cases efficiently and securely.

The toolset includes several PowerShell scripts and executable files, which are all signed by Microsoft. Based on the selected switches, TSS uses one or more scripts and executable files to collect the desired logs.

You can download the toolset as a zip file (*TSS.zip*) from https://aka.ms/getTSS.

## Prerequisites

Here are some prerequisites for the toolset to run properly:

- The TSS toolset must be run in an elevated PowerShell window by accounts with administrator privileges on the local system. Running the TSS toolset in the Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) isn't supported. The end-user license agreement (EULA) must be accepted. Once the EULA is accepted, the TSS toolset won't prompt for the EULA again.

- The PowerShell script execution policy should be set to `RemoteSigned` at the process level by running the cmdlet `Set-ExecutionPolicy -scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force` from an elevated PowerShell command prompt.

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The process level changes only affect the current PowerShell session.

## How to start the TSS toolset

You can start *TSS.ps1* with different switches depending on the scenario. The `-Start` verb is the default and optional verb, and can be replaced with a complementary verb as needed. The complementary `-Start` verbs are `-StartAutoLogger`, `-StartDiag`, `-StartNoWait`, and `-CollectLog`.

|Verb  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`-Start`     |The `-Start` verb starts Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) component traces or support tools such as Windows Performance Recorder (WPR).<br><br>The `[-Start]` verb is optional but can be replaced with complementary `-start` options.         |
|`-StartAutoLogger`     |To collect these logs at the boot time, use `-StartAutoLogger` to replace `-Start`.<br><br>Use it in combination with the `.\TSS.ps1 -Stop` cmdlet to stop the traces once the issue is reproduced.         |
|`-StartDiag`     |While this switch doesn't have much use in the present, it's meant to be used in the future in multiple scenarios. As of today, it can be combined with other arguments like `NET_DFSn` to get diagnostics of the DFSN namespace.         |
|`-StartNoWait`     |This parameter allows the traces to remain active even when you sign out.<br><br>Use it in combination with the `.\TSS.ps1 -Stop` cmdlet to stop the traces once the issue is reproduced.        |
|`-CollectLog`     |This parameter is commonly used along with the argument `DND_SetupReport`.<br><br>Example:<br>`.\TSS.ps1 -Collectlog DND_SetupReport`         |

Logs related to the traces are also automatically collected when you stop data collection.

## Syntax to use TSS toolset

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`<placeholder>`     |The string in angle brackets (\< \>) for placeholders needs to be substituted with an actual scenario name, trace component, command, or value.         |
|`[optional]`     |The keyword or value in square brackets ([ ]) is optional. For example, `[module:int]` means the module and interval are optional. The default value is used if `[<xx>:<yy>]` is omitted.         |
|\|     |This parameter means `'OR'`. You can choose one of the available options.         |
|`:`     |The separator character between two values.         |

## Cmdlet examples

|PowerShell cmdlet  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`.\TSS.ps1 -PerfMon [General:10]`     |This parameter means `PerfMon CounterSetName`= `General` and `Interval`= `10` seconds. When `[General:10]` is omitted, the default kicks in, so `-PerfMon` has the same effect as `-PerfMon General -PerfIntervalSec 10`.         |
|`.\TSS.ps1 [-StopWaitTimeInSec <N>]`      |This parameter means that the argument `-StopWaitTimeInSec` is optional, but if it's specified, a value for `<N>` ="the number of seconds" is mandatory.         |

## Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) trace

|ETW trace  |PowerShell cmdlet  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Enable a scenario trace.     |`.\TSS.ps1 -Scenario <ScenarioName>`         |The supported scenario names are listed using the `TSS.ps1 -ListSupportedScenarioTrace` cmdlet.         |
|Enable component traces.     |`.\TSS.ps1 <-ComponentName> <-ComponentName> ...`         |The supported `<-componentName>` is listed using the `TSS.ps1 -ListSupportedTrace` cmdlet.         |
|Start traces with no-wait mode.     |`.\TSS.ps1 -StartNoWait -Scenario <ScenarioName>`<br><br>`.\TSS.ps1 -Stop`         |The prompt returns immediately, so you can sign out or use a cmdlet like `Shutdown`.<br><br>The cmdlet `.\TSS.ps1 -Stop` stops the trace.         |

> [!NOTE]  
> To list all provider GUIDs of components and/or scenarios, use the `-ListETWProviders` cmdlet. For example:
>
> ```PowerShell
> .\TSS.ps1 -ListETWProviders <component-/scenario-name>
> ```

```

## Parameters within TSS options

Defines specific parameters within the TSS options to control, enhance, or simplify data collection.

|Parameter  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|`-AcceptEula`     |Don't ask at first; run to accept the Disclaimer (useful for the `-RemoteRun` execution).         |
|`-AddDescription <description>`     |Add a brief description of the repro issue. The name of the resulting zip file will include such a description.         |
|`-Assist`     |Accessibility mode.         |
|`-BasicLog`     |Collect the full basic log (the mini basic log is always collected by default).         |
|`-CollectComponentLog`     |Use with `-Scenario`. By default, component collect functions aren't called in the `-Scenario` trace. This switch enables the component collect functions to be called.         |
|`-CollectDump`     |Collect system dump (*memory.dmp*) after stopping all traces. `-CollectDump` can be used with `-Start` and `-Stop`.         |
|`-CollectEventLog <Eventlog[]>`     |Collect specified event logs. The asterisk (\*) wildcard character can be used for the event log name.<br><br>Example:<br>`-CollectEventLog Security,*Cred*`<br>Collect security and all event logs that match `*Cred*` like `'Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-CredentialRoaming/Operational'`.         |
|`-CommonTask` \<`<POD>`\|`Full`\|`Mini`>     |Run common tasks before starting and after stopping the trace.<br><br>`<POD>`: currently, only "NET" is available. Collect additional information before starting and after stopping the trace.<br>`Full`: the full basic log is collected after stopping the trace.<br>`Mini`: the mini basic log is collected after stopping the trace.         |
|`-Crash`     |Trigger a system crash with `NotMyFault` at the stop of repro, or after all events are signaled if used with `-WaitEvent`.<br><br>Caution:<br>This switch will force a memory dump (the system will restart), so open files won't be saved.          |
|`-CustomETL`     |Add custom ETL trace providers. For example, `.\TSS.ps1 -WIN_CustomETL -CustomETL '{<GUID>}','Microsoft-Windows-PrimaryNetworkIcon'` (a comma-separated list of single-quoted `'{GUID}'` and/or `'Provider-Name'`).         |
|`-DebugMode`     |Run with debug mode for a developer.         |
|`-VerboseMode`     |Show more verbose or informational output while processing TSS functions.         |
|`-Discard`     |Used to discard a dataset at phase `-Stop`. `*Stop-` or `*Collect-` functions won't run. `xray` and `psSDP` will be skipped.         |
|`-EnableCOMDebug`     |Module to turn on COM debug mode.         |
|`-ETLOptions` \<`circular`\|`newfile`>:\<`ETLMaxSizeMB`>:\<`ETLNumberToKeep`>:\<`ETLFileMax`>     |Set options passed to `logman` commands. The default value for `circular ETLMaxSizeMB` is 1024, and the default value for `newfile ETLMaxSizeMB` is 512.<br><br>`-StartAutologger` only supports `-ETLOptions circular:<ETLMaxSize>:<ETLNumberToKeep>:<ETLFileMax>`, but `ETLNumberToKeep` won't be executed expectedly.<br><br>Example.1:<br>`-ETLOptions newfile:2048:5`<br><br>Run `newfile` logs with a size of 2048 MB. Keep only the last five `*.etl` files. The default setting for circular mode is `circular:1024`, and for newfile mode is `newfile:512:10`.<br><br>Example 2:<br>`-StartAutologger -ETLOptions circular:4096`<br>`Autologger` won't obey `:<ETLNumberToKeep>` and it only accepts mode circular.<br><br>Example 3:<br>`-StartAutologger -ETLOptions circular:4096:10:3`<br>`Autologger` won't obey `:<ETLNumberToKeep>` and it only accepts mode circular and "3" as the number of `autologger` generations.          |
|`-ETWlevel` \<`Info`\|`Warning`\|`Error`>     |Set Event Tracing Level. The default value is 0xFF.         |
|`-EvtDaysBack <N>`     |Convert event logs only for the last N days. The default value is 30 days. It also applies to the SDP report.<br><br>Note:<br>Security event logs will be skipped.          |
|`-ExternalScript <path to external PS file>`     |Run the specified PowerShell script before starting the trace.         |
|`-LogFolderPath <Drive:\path to log folder>`     |Use a different log folder path for the resulting output data instead of the default location (*C:\\MS_DATA*). It's useful when drive *C:* is low on free disk space.         |
|`-MaxEvents <N>`     |As an argument for `'-WaitEvent Evt:..'`, the parameter will investigate the last N number of events with the same event ID (the default value is 1).         |
|`-Mini`     |Collect only minimal data. Skip `noPSR`, `noSDP`, `noVideo`, `noXray`, `noZip`, and `noBasicLog`.         |
|`-Mode` \<`Basic`\|`Medium`\|`Advanced`\|`Full`\|`Verbose`\|`VerboseEx`\|`Hang`\|`Restart`<br>\|`Swarm`\|`Kube`\|`GetFarmdata`\|`Permission`\|`traceMS`>     |Run scripts in `Basic`, `Medium`, `Advanced`, `Full`, or `Verbose(Ex)` mode for data collection. `Restart` will restart the associated service.         |
|`-RemoteRun`     |Use when TSS is being executed on a remote host, for example, via PsExec, in the Azure Serial Console, or with PowerShell remoting. This parameter will inhibit PSR, video recording, starting TssClock, and opening Explorer with final results. In such a case, also consider `-AcceptEula`.         |
|`-StartNoWait`     |Don't wait, and prompt will return immediately. This parameter is useful for the scenario where a user needs to log off.         |
|`-WaitEvent`     |Monitor for the specified event or stop-trigger; if it's signaled, traces will be stopped automatically.<br><br>There's a wide variety of options to trigger an automatic stop. Run `.\TSS.ps1 -Find Monitoring` to see the usage.         |
|`-Update`<br>1. `-UpdMode` \<`Online`\|`Lite`>      |Update the TSS package. It can be used together with `-UpdMode Online|Lite`.<br><br>`Online` is the default, and `Lite` is the `Upd` lite version.         |
|`-Help`<br>1. `Common`<br>2. `ALL`<br>3. `Monitoring`<br>4. `Config`<br>5. `Keyword`     |Provide help messages on various scenarios.<br><br>1. Common general help message.<br>2.    All available options.<br>3. Show help messages for monitoring and remote features.<br>4. Help with all config parameters.<br>5. You can enter any keyword, and it will show the help information about that keyword.          |
|`-Status`     |Show the status of the running trace, if any.        |

## Helper scripts and tools included

|Helper script and tool  |Description  |

## Troubleshoot unexpected PowerShell errors

1. Run this cmdlet after a failure:

    ```PowerShell
    .\TSS.ps1 -Stop -noBasiclog -noXray
    ```

2. Close the opened elevated PowerShell window and start a new elevated PowerShell window.
3. Allow PowerShell scripts to run on your system with the proper `ExecutionPolicy`.
4. If you encounter an error indicating that the running script is disabled, try the following methods.

### Method 1

1. Run the following cmdlet:
  
      ```PowerShell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -force -Scope Process
      ```

2. Verify the settings with the `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List` cmdlet that no `ExecutionPolicy` with higher precedence is blocking the execution of this script.
3. Run the `.\TSS.ps1 <Desired Parameters>` cmdlet again.

### Method 2 (alternative)

If scripts are blocked by `MachinePolicy`, run the following cmdlets in an elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell -Name ExecutionPolicy -Value RemoteSigned
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell -Name EnableScripts  -Value 1 -Type DWord
```

### Method 3 (alternative)

If scripts are blocked by `UserPolicy`, run the following cmdlets in an elevated PowerShell window:

```powershell
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell -Name ExecutionPolicy -Value RemoteSigned
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell -Name EnableScripts  -Value 1 -Type DWord
```

> [!NOTE]
> Method 2 is only a workaround for the Policy `MachinePolicy - RemoteSigned`. If you also see `UserPolicy - RemoteSigned`, ask the domain admin for a temporary Group Policy Object (GPO) exemption.
>
> In rare situations, you can try the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` cmdlet.
>
> If your organization forces the GPO PowerShell constrained language mode (`System.Management.Automation.EngineIntrinsics.SessionState.LanguageMode -ne 'FullLanguage'`), ask the domain admin for a temporary GPO exemption.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

- Q1: Does the TSS script change any setup or configuration of my system?

    A1: No, but a registry setting is required for enabling debug logging in some scenarios. The script sets the necessary key at the start of the data collection and reverts the key to the default value at the end of the data collection. It may also delete some caches (for example, the ARP cache or the name resolution cache) at the start of the data collection to observe the problem from the logs.

- Q2: Does the TSS toolset put an additional load on the server?

    A2: Some loggings (for example, network capturing, ETW tracing collection, and so on) that are started by the TSS toolset might put a minor load on the system. The load is usually at ignorable levels. Contact your support representative when you see high CPU, memory, or disk usage after starting the TSS toolset.

- Q3: Why can't we reproduce the issue when the TSS toolset is running?

    A3: The TSS toolset may delete all cached information at the start. It also starts the network capturing in a promiscuous mode, which changes the Network Interface Card (NIC) default behaviors. These changes might affect the issue, and the problems may disappear. Especially for particular timing issues, problems disappear because of the TSS toolset's data collection. The data collection starts logging, which might affect the issue indirectly and change the situation.

- Q4: Why is the TSS toolset not responding for a long time?

    A4: In some cases, the operating system's built-in commands run by the TSS toolset might not respond or take a long time to complete. Contact your support representative if you experience this issue.

- Q5: Do I need to worry about disk space or anything else when I run the TSS toolset for a long time?

    A5: All TSS tracing is configured to run with ring buffers, so you can run the toolset for a long time if needed. The TSS toolset also calculates disk space at the beginning of the data collection and may exit if there isn't sufficient disk space. If you see high disk usage after starting the TSS toolset or have any other concerns about the disk usage of the toolset, contact your support representative.

- Q6: What should I do if I receive the following security warning when running the *.\\TSS.ps1* script?

    `Security Warning: Run only scripts that you trust. While scripts from the Internet can be useful, this script can potentially harm your computer. Do you want to run .\TSS.ps1? [D] Do not run [R] Run once [S] Suspend [?] Help (default is "D")`

    A6: In rare situations, you may receive this security warning. You may unblock the script by using the cmdlet `PS C:\> Unblock-File -Path C:\TSS\TSS.ps1`. This script will unblock all other modules by using the cmdlet `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path C:\TSS\*.ps* | Unblock-File -Confirm:$false`.
