## Symptoms

Disabling FBWF produces a crash. When this situation occurs, FBWF cannot be disabled.

Disable System Restore before enabling FBWF, post SYSPREP. Use the following steps to disable System Restore:

1. Click **Start**, right-click **My Computer**, and then click **Properties**.
2. In the **System Properties** dialog box, click the **System Restore** tab.
3. Click to select the **Turn off System Restore** check box. Or, click to select the **Turn off System Restore** on all drives check box.
4. Click **OK**.
5. Click **Yes** when you receive the following message, to confirm that you want to turn off System Restore:

    > You have chosen to turn off System Restore. If you continue, all existing restore points will be deleted, and you will not be able to track or undo changes to your computer.

Do you want to turn off System Restore?

After a few moments, the **System Properties** dialog box closes.

## More information

You can also use Registry Editor to disable System Restore. To use this alternative, perform the following steps:

1. Start the registry editor (regedit.exe).

1. Go to `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\sr]`.

1. If a **DisableSR** value doesn't exist, go to the **Edit** menu, select **New**, **DWORD** value, and create the value. Set the value to **4** to disable System Restore or **0** to enable System Restore.

1. Go to `[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\srservice]`

1. Double-click **Start**, and set the value to **4** to stop the service from starting or to **0** for normal startup.

1. Close the Registry Editor.
