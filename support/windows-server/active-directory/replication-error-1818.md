## Symptoms

This article describes the symptoms, cause, and resolution steps when Active Directory replication fails with error 1818: The remote procedure call was cancelled (RPC_S_CALL_CANCELLED).

1. Possible formats for the error include:

    |Decimal|Hex|Symbolic|Error string|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |1818|0x71a|RPC_S_CALL_CANCELLED|The remote procedure call was cancelled.|

2. The following events get logged

    |Event source|Event ID|Event string|
    |---|---|---|
    |NTDS Replication|1232|Active Directory attempted to perform a remote procedure call (RPC) to the following server. The call timed out and was cancelled.|
    |NTDS Replication|1188|A thread in Active Directory is waiting for the completion of an RPC made to the following domain controller.<br/>Domain controller:<br/>b8b5a0e4-92d5-4a88-a601-61971d7033af._msdcs.Contoso.com<br/>Operation:<br/>get changes<br/>Thread ID:<br/>448<br/>Timeout period (minutes):<br/>5<br/>Active Directory has attempted to cancel the call and recover this thread.<br/>User Action<br/>If this condition continues, restart the domain controller.|
    |<br/>NTDS Replication|1173 with error status 1818|Internal event: Active Directory has encountered the following exception and associated parameters. Exception: e0010002 Parameter: 0 Additional Data Error value: 1818 Internal ID: 5000ede|
    |NTDS Replication|1085 with error status 1818|Internal event: Active Directory could not synchronize the following directory partition with the domain controller at the following network address.<br/>Directory partition: \<NC><br/>Network address: \<GUID-based DC name><br/>If this error continues, the Knowledge Consistency Checker (KCC) will reconfigure the replication links and bypass the domain controller.<br/>User Action<br/>Verify that the network address can be resolved with a DNS query.<br/>Additional Data Error value: 1818 The remote procedure call was cancelled.|

    . `Repadmin /showreps` displays the following error message

    > _DC=Contoso,DC=com_  
    >
    > *\<Sitename>\\\<DCname> via RPC DC*  
    >
    > *DC object GUID: \<GUID> Last attempt @ 2009-11-25 10:56:55 failed, result 1818 (0x71a): Can't retrieve message string 1818*  
    >
    > _(0x71a), error 1815. 823 consecutive failure(s). Last success @ (never)._  

3. `Repadmin /showreps` from Domain Controller Name shows that it's failing to pull Domain NC from \<SiteName> but can pull all other NCs

    > \===================  
    >
    > *\<Sitename>\\\<DC name>*  
    >
    > _DC Options: IS_GC_  
    >
    > _Site Options: IS_INTER_SITE_AUTO_TOPOLOGY_DISABLED_  
    >
    > *DC object GUID: \<GUID>*  
    >
    > *DC invocationID: \<InvocationID>*  
    >
    > _==== INBOUND NEIGHBORS =====================================_  
    >
    > _DC=Contoso,DC=com_  
    >
    > *\<Sitename>\\\<DCname> via RPC DC*  
    >
    > *DC object GUID: \<GUID>*  
    >
    > *Last attempt @ \<DateTime> failed, result 1818 (0x71a):*  
    >
    > _Can't retrieve message string 1818 (0x71a), error 1815. 123 consecutive_  
    >
    > _failure(s). Last success @ (never)._  

4. DCPromo fails while promoting a new domain controller and you see the following error on the DCPROMO GUI

    > Active Directory Installation wizard.
    >
    > The Operation Failed because:
    Active Directory could not replicate the directory partition  
    CN=Configuration....from the remote domain controller "server name"  
    " The remote procedure call was cancelled "

    The following entries are logged in the DCPROMO logs

    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] EVENTLOG (Informational): NTDS General / Service Control : 1004*  
    >
    > _Active Directory Domain Services was shut down successfully._  
    >
    >  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] NtdsInstall for \<FQDN fo the domain> returned 1818*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] DsRolepInstallDs returned 1818*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [ERROR] Failed to install to Directory Service (1818)*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [ERROR] DsRolepFinishSysVolPropagation (Abort Promote) failed with 8001*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] Starting service NETLOGON*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] Configuring service NETLOGON to 2 returned 0*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] The attempted domain controller operation has completed*  
    >
    > *\<DateTime> [INFO] DsRolepSetOperationDone returned 0*  

5. While trying to rehost a partition on the Global catalog

    > _repadmin /rehost fail with DsReplicaAdd failed with status_  
    >
    > _1818 (0x71a)>_
    >
    > _DsReplicaAdd fails with status 1818 (0x71a)_  

## Cause

The issue occurs when the destination DC performing inbound replication doesn't receive replication changes within the number of seconds specified in the `RPC Replication Timeout (mins)` registry value (the default value is five minutes if the registry entry doesn't exist). You might experience this issue most frequently in one of the following situations:

- You promote a new domain controller into the forest by using the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard from the Server Manager management console or via the `Install-ADDSDomainController` cmdlet.
- Existing domain controllers replicate from source domain controllers that are connected over slow network links.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> - Registry value name: `RPC Replication Timeout (mins)`
> - Registry value location: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters`
> - Registry value type: `REG_DWORD`

If a destination domain controller that is performing RPC-based replication doesn't receive the requested replication package within the time that the `RPC Replication Timeout (mins)` registry setting specifies, the destination domain controller ends the RPC connection with the nonresponsive source domain controller and logs a warning event.

Some specific root causes for Active Directory logging `1818 \ 0x71a \ RPC_S_CALL_CANCELLED` include:

1. An earlier Network Interface Card driver installed on Domain Controllers could cause failure of a few network features like Scalable Networking Pack (SNP).
2. Low bandwidth or network packets drops between source and destination domain controllers.
3. The networking device between source and destination device dropping packets.  

> [!Note]
> A speed and duplex mismatch between the NIC and switch on a domain controller could cause dropped frames, resets, duplicate acknowledgments, and retransmitted frames.

## Resolution

1. Inspect the network devices between the source and destination domain controllers (increase the bandwidth of your network connection so that the Active Directory changes replicate in the five-minute timeout period.)
2. Update the network adapter drivers.

    To determine whether an updated network adapter driver is available, contact the network adapter manufacturer or the original equipment manager (OEM) for the computer. The driver must meet Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 5.2 or a later version of this specification.
3. Check the network binding order:

    To configure the network binding order:
   
   1. Quit any programs that are running.
   2. Right-click **Network Neighborhood**, and then select **Properties**.      
   3. Select the **Bindings** tab. In the **Show Bindings For** box, select **All Services**.      
   4. Double-click each listed service to expand it.      
   5. Under each service, double-click each protocol to expand it.      
   6. Under each protocol, there are many network adapter icons. Select the icon for your network adapter, and then select **Move Up** until the network adapter is at the top of the list. Leave the **Remote Access WAN Wrapper** entries in any order under the network adapter(s).
   
      > [!NOTE]
      > If you have more than one network adapter, place the internal adapter (with Internet Protocol [IP] address 10.0.0.2 by default on a Small Business Server network) at the top of the binding order, with the external adapter(s) directly below the internal adapter.
    
      The final order should appear similar to:
      
      [1] Network adapter one  
      [2] Network adapter two (if present)  
      [3] Remote Access WAN Wrapper  
      .  
      .  
      .  
      [n] Remote Access WAN Wrapper  
      
   8. Repeat step f for each service in the dialog box.      
   9. After you verify the settings for each service, select **All Protocols** in the **Show Bindings For** box. The entry for **Remote Access WAN Wrapper** doesn't have a network adapter listed. Skip this item. Repeat steps d through f for each remaining protocol.    
   10. After you verify that the bindings are set correctly for all services and protocols, select **OK**. This initializes the rebinding of the services. When this is complete, you're prompted to restart the computer. Select **Yes**.
