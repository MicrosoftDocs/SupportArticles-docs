# 0x80004027 error when you try to remotely access COM+ object after you upgrade to Windows Server 2016 or later versions

This article provides a solution to the 0x80004027-CO_E_CLASS_DISABLED error that occurs when you remotely access COM+ object after you upgrade to Windows Server 2016 or later versions.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3182294

## Symptoms

After you upgrade from an earlier release of Windows Server to Windows Server 2016 or later versions, applications cannot remotely access a COM+ object, and you receive the following error message:

> 0x80004027-CO_E_CLASS_DISABLED

## Cause

This problem occurs because support for the Application Server role was removed from Windows Server 2016 or later versions. This change blocks applications that rely on COM+ remote access.

## Resolution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

To resolve this problem and enable COM+ remote access, follow these steps:

1. Enable COM+ Network Access in Windows Firewall. To do this, open **Control Panel**, click the **Windows Firewall** item, and then click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall**.

2. In the **Allowed apps and features** list, select the **COM+ Network Access** check box, and then select the appropriate scope that's required for your application. For enterprises, this is typically Domain. However, your application may require additional settings, depending on the scenario.

3. Set the registry value that allows COM+ remote access. To do this, follow these steps:

    1. In the **Start search** box, type regedit, and then click **regedit.exe** in the results list.
    2. Locate the following subkey:  
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\COM3`
    3. Right-click the **RemoteAccessEnabled** DWORD.
    4. In the **Value data** box, enter 1.
    5. Click **OK**.
