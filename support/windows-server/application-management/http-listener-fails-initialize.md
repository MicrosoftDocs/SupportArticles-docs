# HTTP Listener fails to initialize when lacking SeChangeNotifyPrivilege

This article provides a solution to an issue that HTTP Listener fails to initialize when user lacks SeChangeNotifyPrivilege.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4570992

## Symptoms

When initializing a new HTTP Listener using the `HttpInitialize` function or the .NET `HttpListener` class, the operation fails and you receive this error message:

> HttpInitialize failed with 5 ( -access denied)

## Cause

This issue occurs when the account running the code lacks the **SeChangeNotifyPrivilege** privilege.

## Workaround

Grant the [Bypass traverse checking](/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/bypass-traverse-checking) user right to the relevant account.

This privilege is granted to the Everyone group by default.
