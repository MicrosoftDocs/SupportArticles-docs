# Performance degrades when you access large files with FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS

This article provides a solution to an issue that operating system performance may degrade when one or more processes access multiple large files using the `CreateFile()` API and the `FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS` flag.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2549369

## Symptoms

Operating system performance may degrade when one or more processes access multiple large files using the `CreateFile()` API and the `FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS` flag. The performance degradation is because of the system cache consuming available memory (visible in the performance counter Memory\Cache Bytes).

## Cause

The `FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS` flag is a hint to the Cache Manager that the file will be opened for random I/O. Random I/O means there is no predictable pattern to the I/O that will take place. This flag disables intelligent read-aheads and prevents automatic unmapping of views after pages are read to minimize mapping/unmapping when the process revisits that part of the file. This keeps previously read views in the Cache Manager working set. However, if the cumulative size of the accessed files exceeds physical memory, keeping so many views in the Cache Manager working set may be detrimental to overall operating system performance because it can consume a large amount of physical RAM.

## Resolution

Remove the `FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS` flag when the application opens the file(s) with `CreateFile`. This will allows the views to be unmapped and moved to the standby list after page reads are completed. This will require involvement from the software developer.
