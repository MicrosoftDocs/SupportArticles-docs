# Event ID 32 occurs, and shadow copies are unexpectedly deleted

This article introduces a workaround for an issue in which shadow copy volume is delayed in being brought online, and shadow copies are unexpectedly deleted. Event ID 32 is received when the issue occurs.

## Symptom

On a server, shadow copies are stored on a different volume. After you restart the server, you find shadow copies are deleted. Additionally, you receive the following event log:

```output
Log Name:      System
Source:        volsnap
Event ID:      32
Task Category: None
Level:         Error
Keywords:      Classic
User:          N/A
Description:
The shadow copies of volume X: were aborted because the shadow copy storage volume was not present.
```

You may notice delays in bringing the shadow copy volume online. 

## Cause

This issue occurs because there are multiple phantom shadow copy entries under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\STORAGE\VolumeSnapshot`. It increases the time for the snapshots to be enumerated on the shadow storage volume when the parent volume comes online.

If it takes a long time in the enumeration, volsnap will delete these snapshots.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, use the [devnodeClean.exe tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42286) to clean up the large buildup of phantom VolumeSnapshots in the registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\STORAGE\VolumeSnapshot`.

> [!NOTE]
> The *devnodeclean.exe* tool will only delete phantom shadow copies. Valid shadow copies will remain intact.

To get the list of entries to be deleted, run the following command:

```console
devnodeclean /n
```

To delete the phantom shadow copies, run the following command:

```console
devnodeclean
```

Additionally, we recommend configuring a `devnodeclean` scheduled task to proactively remove stale entries.
