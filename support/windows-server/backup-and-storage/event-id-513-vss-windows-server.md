# Event ID 513 when running VSS in Windows Server

This article provides a workaround to Event ID 513 when running VSS in Windows Server.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; All supported versions of Windows Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3209092

## Symptoms

In Windows Server, when an application calls the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to run a backup, Event 513 may be generated:

```output
Log Name: Application  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2  
Event ID: 513  
Task Category: none  
Level: Error  

Description:  
An error occurred in Cryptographic Services while processing the OnIdentity() call in System Writer Object.

Details:  
AddLegacyDriverFiles: Unable to back up image of binary Microsoft Link-Layer Discovery Protocol.

System Error:  
Access is denied.
```

## Cause

This problem occurs because VSS System Writer does not have permission to read the NT AUTHORITY\\SERVICE (service account). When System Writer runs as a cryptographic service and tries to read the Mslldp.sys information from a Microsoft Link-Layer Discovery Protocol driver, the "access denied" error is generated.

## Workaround

This event log entry can be safely ignored. To prevent this entry from being logged, grant the required permission to the Microsoft Link-Layer Discovery Protocol driver (Mslldp.dll) to process System Writer.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open an administrative Command Prompt window, and then run the following command to check the current permissions:  

    ```console
    sc sdshow mslldp
    ```

2. Copy the output string from step 1, append it with `(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)`, and then run the following command to add the access permission to Mslldp.dll:  

    ```console
    sc sdset mslldp <string>
    ```

    For example, run the following command:  

    ```console
    sc sdset mslldp D:(D;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BG)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)(A;;CCDCLCSWRPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)(A;;CCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRRC;;;SO)(A;;LCRPWP;;;S-1-5-80-3141615172-2057878085-1754447212-2405740020-3916490453)(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)
    ```
