# The FSRM quota usage is incorrect when you change the size of the page file in Windows

This article provides a workaround for an issue where the File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) quota usage is incorrect.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3034439

## Symptoms

This issue occurs on a computer that is running Windows Server 2012 R2 that has the [FSRM](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831701(v=ws.11)) feature enabled.

## Cause

This issue occurs because FSRM detects that the size of the page file is excluded in the FSRM quota.

## Workaround

Run the `Update-FsrmQuota-path paths` command in Windows PowerShell to perform the scan again and recalculate quota usage information.

## Status

This behavior is expected.
