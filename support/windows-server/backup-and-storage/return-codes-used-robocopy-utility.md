|Value|Description|
|---|---|
|0|No files were copied. No failure was met. No files were mismatched. The files already exist in the destination directory; so the copy operation was skipped.|
|1|All files were copied successfully.|
|2|There are some additional files in the destination directory that aren't present in the source directory. No files were copied.|
|3|Some files were copied. Additional files were present. No failure was met.|
|5|Some files were copied. Some files were mismatched. No failure was met.|
|6|Additional files and mismatched files exist. No files were copied and no failures were met. Which means that the files already exist in the destination directory.|
|7|Files were copied, a file mismatch was present, and additional files were present.|
|8|Several files didn't copy.|
