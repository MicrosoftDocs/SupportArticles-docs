# System state backup by using Windows Server Backup fails with error: System writer is not found in the backup

This article provides a solution to an issue where you fail to perform a system state backup by using Windows Server Backup.

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2009272

## Symptoms

When you perform a system state backup using Windows Server Backup on Windows Server 2008, the backup fails with the following error:  

> Backup of system state failed [*\<DateTime>*]  
Log of files successfully backed up  
'C:\Windows\Logs\WindowsServerBackup\SystemStateBackup *\<DateTime>*.log'  
Log of files for which backup failed  
'C:\Windows\Logs\WindowsServerBackup\SystemStateBackup_Error *\<DateTime>*.log'  
System writer is not found in the backup.

In the Application event log, the following events are logged:  

> Log Name: Application  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-Backup  
Event ID: 517  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Backup started at '*\<DateTime>*' failed with following error code '2155348226' (System writer is not found in the backup.). Please rerun backup once issue is resolved.
>
> Log Name: Application  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2  
Event ID: 513  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Cryptographic Services failed while processing the OnIdentity() call in the System Writer Object.  
Details:  
AddCoreCsiFiles: BeginFileEnumeration() failed.  
System Error:  
Access is denied.  

## Cause

The system writer fails because permissions to files in the `%windir%\winsxs\filemaps\` or `%windir%\winsxs\temp\PendingRenames` directories are incorrect.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, type the following commands from an elevated command prompt:

```console
Takeown /f %windir%\winsxs\temp\PendingRenames /a
icacls %windir%\winsxs\temp\PendingRenames /grant "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(RX)"
icacls %windir%\winsxs\temp\PendingRenames /grant "NT Service\trustedinstaller:(F)"
icacls %windir%\winsxs\temp\PendingRenames /grant "BUILTIN\Users:(RX)"
Takeown /f %windir%\winsxs\filemaps\* /a
icacls %windir%\winsxs\filemaps\*.* /grant "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(RX)"
icacls %windir%\winsxs\filemaps\*.* /grant "NT Service\trustedinstaller:(F)"
icacls %windir%\winsxs\filemaps\*.* /grant "BUILTIN\Users:(RX)"
net stop cryptsvc
net start cryptsvc
```

Type the following command to verify that the system writer is now listed:

```console
vssadmin list writers
```

If the system writer is missing, check the Application event log for the following event:

> Log Name: Application  
Source: VSS  
Event ID: 8213  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Volume Shadow Copy Service error: The process that hosts the writer with name System Writer and ID {e8132975-6f93-4464-a53e-1050253ae220} does not run under a user with sufficient access rights.  Consider running this process under a local account which is either Local System, Administrator, Network Service, or Local Service.

The Details section of the event (Binary Data\In Bytes) would show up as:

Open Regedit and navigate to the following key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\VSS\VssAccessControl`.

Change the value of NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE (REG_DWORD) to 1.

You may also want to check the entry for other services (LOCAL SERVICE, NetworkService) as indicated by event 8213.

The System Writer should now show up in the `vssadmin list writers` command:

> Writer name: System Writer  
Writer Id: {e8132975-6f93-4464-a53e-1050253ae220}

Last error: No error
