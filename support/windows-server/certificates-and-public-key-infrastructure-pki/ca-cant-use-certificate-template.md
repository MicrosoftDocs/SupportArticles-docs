# Certification Authority can't use a certificate template

This article provides a solution to an issue where a certificate template can't load, and certificate requests fail to use the template.

_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 283218

## Symptoms

When Certificate Services starts in the Certification Authority (CA), a certificate template is unable to load and certificate requests are unsuccessful using the template.

When requesting a certificate, once you select the template and click **Enroll**, you receive the error: "The requested certificate template is not supported by this CA. 0x80094800 (-2146875392 CERTSRV_E_UNSUPPORTED_CERT_TYPE)"

## Cause

The behavior occurs because the Authenticated Users group is removed from the template's access control list (ACL). The Authenticated Users group is on a template ACL, by default. (The Certification Authority object itself is included in this group.) If the Authenticated Users group is removed, the (enterprise) CA itself can no longer read the template in the Active Directory, and that's why certificate requests can be unsuccessful.

## Resolution

If an administrator wants to remove the Authenticated Users group, each and every CA's computer account must be added to the template ACLs and set to Read.

## More information

Minimum permissions required for an entity to request a certificate:  

Requesting user/machine: Read & Enroll, Certification Authority Object: Read 

If authenticated users group is removed from the ACLs of a template, the following errors may be observed when the CA starts and when a certificate is requested against the template. 

## Errors observed when enrollment is unsuccessful
