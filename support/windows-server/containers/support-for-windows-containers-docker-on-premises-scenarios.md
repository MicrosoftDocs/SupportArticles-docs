# Support policy for Windows Server containers in on-premises scenarios

This article outlines Microsoft's support policy concerning Windows Server containers and Mirantis Container Runtime (formerly known as Docker Enterprise engine (Docker EE)) for on-premises implementations.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4489234

Microsoft supports Windows Server containers for the following  Windows versions and releases:

- Windows Server, version 1909, 2004 and 20H2 Standard Core or Datacenter Core
- Windows Server 2016 (1607)
- Windows 10 Professional and Enterprise with Docker Desktop installed
- Azure Stack HCI (when hosting Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI)
- Windows IoT Core

Please refer to Overview - Product end of support for more information on the end of support.

> [!NOTE]
> When customers experience issues with or have questions about Windows Server containers on Windows Server and Mirantis Container Runtime functionality, Microsoft is the first point of contact. For similar information about Microsoft's support policy for containers in Azure, see [Support policy for containers and related services on Azure](/troubleshoot/azure/general/support-policy-containers).

## Supported configurations for container hosts

Microsoft defines the supported host configurations in the following terms:

- Host operating system: Windows Server or Windows 10. For more information, see [Windows containers requirements](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/system-requirements).
- Hypervisor: Windows 10 must run Hyper-V to support containers; Windows Server, as shown in the table, has more flexibility.
- Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR): Mirantis Container Runtime is a third-party application used to create and manage containers that run on Windows Server. For more information, see [Windows containers requirements](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/system-requirements).
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for Windows runs on Windows 10.
- Container type: Microsoft supports Windows Server containers with Hyper-V isolation. However, not all host configurations can support any container type. For general information about Windows Server containers and container types, see [Container base images](/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/container-base-images) and [Windows container version compatibility](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility).

> [!NOTE]
> The Linux Containers on Windows (LCOW) feature on Windows Server has been deprecated.

## Host component support

Customers that deploy Windows Server containers on supported Windows Server versions running on physical hardware or virtual machines (VM) on Hyper-V will receive full support for issues related to the operating system, container base images and/or container engine.

## Supported configurations for Windows Server container hosts

To deploy Windows Server containers and Hyper-V container with isolation, the Mirantis Container Runtime must be installed (see [Get started: Prep Windows for containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment#windows-server)).

## Supported container types on physical container host

|Hypervisor|Support container types|
|---------|---------|
|None|Windows Server containers|
|Hyper-V|Hyper-V isolation and Windows Server containers|

## Supported container types on a virtual machine container host

|VM Host Hypervisor|Guests OS|Guest Hypervisor|Supported Container Types|
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Hyper-V|Windows Server (full or core)|None|Windows Server containers|
|Hyper-V|Windows Server (full or core)|Hyper-V (must be running in [nested virtualization mode](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization))|Windows Server containers and Hyper-V isolated containers|
|SVVP validated hypervisor|Windows Server (full or core)|None (Hyper-V not supported on VMWare ESX)|Windows Server containers|

For more information on SVVP validated hypervisors, see [Welcome to the Windows Server Virtualization Validation Program](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/svvp.aspx).

## Supported configurations for Windows 10 container hosts

Microsoft supports containers on Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise under the following conditions:

- A physical computer operating system of Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise with Anniversary Update (version 1607) or later.
- Hyper-V is installed.
- The container type is Hyper-V with isolation (default).
- Docker Desktop for Windows is installed (see [Install Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) on Docker's website). Docker Desktop for Windows is the Community Edition (CE) and is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

> [!NOTE]
> Users are no longer disallowed from running Windows Server containers in process isolation mode on Windows 10 Enterprise or Professional for dev/test purposes since Windows 10 October 2018 update. See the [FAQ](/virtualization/windowscontainers/about/faq) to learn more.

Microsoft doesn't provide support for the following configurations on Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise:

- Docker Desktop. You can get support from the [Docker Community Forums](https://forums.docker.com/c/docker-desktop-for-windows) or from Docker support. For more information, see Docker Desktop for Windows FAQ.
- Windows Server containers or Hyper-V containers with isolation on virtual machines that are hosted on a Windows 10 Professional or Windows 10 Enterprise system. To use containers on a virtual machine, use Windows Server as the host.

## Requirement for container hosts

For information about requirements for containers hosts, see:

- [Windows container requirements](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/system-requirements)
- [System requirements for Hyper-V on Windows Server](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/system-requirements-for-hyper-v-on-windows#general-requirements)

- [Windows Container Version Compatibility](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility)
- [Linux containers on Windows 10](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/linux-containers)

For more information about requirements and compatibility issues for virtualization, see [Windows Server Catalog: Server Virtualization Validation Program](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/svvp.aspx?svvppage=svvp.htm).

## Hyper-V isolated container requirements

To run Hyper-V containers, the container host must meet the requirements for running Hyper-V itself. To summarize Hyper-V requirements for Windows Server:

- 64-bit processor, with the following capabilities
  - Second-level address translation (SLAT): The Windows hypervisor functionality requires SLAT (the Hyper-V management tools do not).
  - Hardware-assisted virtualization: This is available in processors that include a virtualization option â€“ specifically processors with Intel Virtualization Technology (Intel VT) or AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) technology.
  - Hardware-enforced Data Execution Prevention (DEP) must be available and enabled. For Intel systems, this is the XD bit (execute disable bit). For AMD systems, this is the NX bit (no execute bit).
- VM Monitor Mode extensions.
- At least 4 GB of RAM. More memory is better. You'll need enough memory for the host and all virtual machines that you want to run at the same time.
- Virtualization support turned on in the BIOS or UEFI.

For more information on system requirements:

- [System requirements for Hyper-V on Windows Server](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/system-requirements-for-hyper-v-on-windows)
- [Windows 10 Hyper-V System Requirements](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/reference/hyper-v-requirements)
- [How to enable nested virtualization in an Azure VM](/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/nested-virtualization)

## Supported container images

Microsoft offers four container base images that users can build from. Each base image is a different type of Windows operating system, has a different on-disk footprint, and has a different set of Windows API. See [Container Base Images](/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/container-base-images) for more information.

- Windows Server core: supports traditional .NET framework applications
- Nano Server: built for .NET Core applications
- Windows: provides the full Windows API set
- Windows IoT Core: purpose-built for IoT applications

## Container base OS images that are supported on Windows container hosts

As outlined in Supported container hosts, not all host operating systems support both Windows Server containers and Hyper-V isolated containers. Similarly, not all the base images support both container types. The following table outlines which container types you can create using each base image on each of the host operating systems.

|Container host OS|Windows Server Core container base image|Nano Server container base image|Windows container base image|Windows IoT Core container base image|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Windows Server 2016 or 2019 Standard or Datacenter|Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers with isolation|Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers with isolation|Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers with isolation|Not supported|
|Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise|Hyper-V containers with isolation and Windows Server containers for dev/test|Hyper-V containers with isolation and Windows Server containers for dev/test|Hyper-V containers with isolation and Windows Server containers for dev/test|Not supported|
|Windows IoT Core|Not supported|Not supported|Not supported|Windows Server containers|
  
If you plan to use container hosts that run different versions and releases of Windows, you will also need to consider the versions and releases of the container images. Some container features aren't backward compatible, so some newer container base images may not run on container hosts with old Operation System (OS) versions. See [Windows Container Version Compatibility](/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility) for more information.

## Support for container workloads

Microsoft fully supports the container base images, as described in the "Supported container images" section.

For support of Microsoft applications like IIS, SQL and .NET running in containers, see [Microsoft repository on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/microsoft/) for the respective container image support guidance.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are trying to move a custom application or a third-party application to Windows Server containers running the Windows Server Core image and have issues with missing .DLLs or other components in the Windows Server core base image, try using the Windows container image as it has the full Windows API set.
Avoid copying .DLLs from the container host to the Windows Server Core base image as it may cause the application to misbehave.

Microsoft provided some component .DLLs in redistributable package form. For example, the Windows Server Core container base image doesn't include the VB runtime .DLLs. To get the .DLLs, download the redistributable package Service Pack 6 for Visual Basic 6.0: Run-Time Redistribution Pack (vbrun60sp6.exe) from official Microsoft Download Center and install it in the container image using a Dockerfile.

For guidance on moving legacy apps, see [Lift and shift to containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/lift-shift-to-containers).

## Supported network configurations

Microsoft supports the [Windows container networking](/virtualization/windowscontainers/container-networking/architecture) functionality. This functionality includes the Host Networking Service (HNS) and Host Compute Service (HCS). HNS and HCS work together to create containers (HCS) and attach endpoints to a network (HNS). Additionally, it includes the following container network drivers (for full descriptions of these drivers, see [Windows Container Network Drivers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/container-networking/network-drivers-topologies)):

See this article for [Unsupported features and network options](/virtualization/windowscontainers/container-networking/architecture#unsupported-features-and-network-options).

## Supported service accounts for containers

Microsoft supports Active Directory group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) for containers.

Containers can't be domain-joined.

By using gMSA, Windows Server containers themselves and the service they host can be configured to use a specific gMSA as their domain identity. Any service running with the Local System or Network Service will use the Windows Server containers' identity just like they use the domain-joined host's identity. See [Create gMSAs for Windows containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/manage-serviceaccounts) for more information.

## Supported endpoint security options for containers and container hosts

Windows Defender has been optimized to protect container hosts and is fully supported. However, Microsoft doesn't support Windows Defender running in Windows Server containers.

When using a third-party endpoint security/anti-virus software, verify with the vendor that Windows Server containers are supported and refer to the vendor's public docs for recommendations and exclusions. See [Anti-virus optimization for Windows Containers](/windows-hardware/drivers/ifs/anti-virus-optimization-for-windows-containers) for more information.

## Supported Container Runtime on Windows Server

_Mirantis Container Runtime (MCR)_ is a recommended and supported container runtime interface used to create, manage, and run Windows Server containers on Windows Server. For more information, see [Mirantis](https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/container-runtime/).

See [Get Started: Prep Windows for containers](/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment) for the recommended and supported installation method on Windows Server.

_ContainerD_ is an open-source industry-standard container runtime that is supported by the community. ContainerD running on Windows Server can create, manage, and run Windows Server Containers but Microsoft doesn't provide any support for it. For any issues or questions related to ContainerD, ask the [GitHub community](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues). For more information, see the [GitHub ContainerD project](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues) and [ContainerD project](https://containerd.io/).

## Supported Container Orchestrators

Several container orchestrators support Windows Server containers. Please address any issues or questions with the vendor before engaging Microsoft support.

_Docker swarm_ is a feature of the Mirantis Container Runtime that creates, manages, and runs Windows Server containers in a mixed node environment of Linux and Windows hosts. Docker swarm is fully supported by Mirantis. Mirantis support will advise customers on whether Microsoft support should be engaged regarding issues or questions related to Windows Server. For more information about using Docker swarm with Windows Server containers, see [Getting started with swarm mode](/virtualization/windowscontainers/manage-containers/swarm-mode) and [Swarm mode overview](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) on Mirantis website.

_Kubernetes_ is an open-source project that supports Windows Server containers on Windows Server starting with Kubernetes 1.14. For more information, see [Intro to Windows support in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#windows-containers-in-kubernetes) and [Support Functionality and Limitations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#supported-functionality-and-limitations). For further guidance, see [Kubernetes on Windows](/virtualization/windowscontainers/kubernetes/getting-started-kubernetes-windows).

For any issues and questions related to Kubernetes, see [Reporting Issues and Feature Requests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/intro-windows-in-kubernetes/#reporting-issues-and-feature-requests).

Microsoft only provides support for Windows nodes participating in a Kubernetes cluster.

Microsoft doesn't provide support for the following items:

- Setting up and configuring Linux nodes
- Kubernetes binaries
- Linux containers
- Kubernetes plug-ins

Any question or issue related to non-supported items should be addressed to relevant GitHub communities.

_Azure Service Fabric_ is Microsoft's container orchestrator to deploy microservices across a cluster of machines. It is fully supported by Azure. All issues and questions should be directed to Azure support using "[Help + support](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/overview)" in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#home). For more information, see [Introducing the Service Fabric cluster resource manager](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-introduction) and [Service Fabric and containers](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-containers-overview).

_Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI (AKS-HCI)_ is an on-premises implementation of the popular Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) orchestrator, which automatically runs containerized applications at scale.

Microsoft provides end-to-end support for Azure Kubernetes Service on Azure Stack HCI except for the following items:

- Customer application code
- Any non-in-box system services or drivers in the container or container host
- Container base images that aren't supported by Microsoft (such as Nginx) or container base images that aren't listed in the supported add-ons list

_Moby_ is an open-source project intended for engineers, integrators and enthusiasts looking to modify, hack, fix, experiment, invent, and build systems based on containers. For more information, see the [Moby project](https://github.com/moby/moby) on GitHub.

Microsoft doesn't provide support for Moby in a stand-a-lone environment (a single-node container host running Windows Server). All questions and issues should be raised in the Moby project on GitHub.
