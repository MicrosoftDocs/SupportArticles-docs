# Error code 0x8007000D when you try to activate a Windows 7 machine by using any type of product key

This article helps fix the error 0x8007000D that occurs when you activate a Windows 7 machine by using any type of product key.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2230957

## Symptoms

You try to activate a Windows 7 machine by using any type of product key. Running `slsmgr -dlv` or `slmgr -ato` from a command line generates the following error:

> The data is invalid.  
> Error code 8007000d.

## Cause

The System account by default has Full Control permissions to the registry path `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root` and any subkeys.

If those permissions have been altered for the `Root` key or any subkey(s), we would see the error code 0x8007000D.

## Resolution

Assign the minimum permission of Enumerate Subkeys to the System account for the registry path `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root`and any of its subkeys.

## Data collection

If you need assistance from Microsoft support, we recommend you collect the information by following the steps mentioned in [Gather information by using TSS for deployment-related issues](../../windows-client/windows-troubleshooters/gather-information-using-tss-deployment.md).
