This article discusses an issue where converting Windows Server Core to GUI by using a DISM or PowerShell command fails with error 0x800f0906.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3023427

## Symptoms

This issue occurs when you run a DISM command, an equivalent Windows PowerShell command, or another similar method to convert to GUI.

The DISM command that is used for conversion contains the following switches:

`/enable-feature /featurename:ServerCore-FullServer /featurename:Server-Gui-Mgmt /featurename:Server-Gui-Shell`

You receive one of the following information clusters on the command prompt:

- Information for failure with error code 0x800f0906:

    ```console
    Dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:ServerCore-FullServer /featurename:Server-Gui-Mgmt /featurename:Server-Gui-Shell /source:wim:d:\sources\install.wim:4
    ```

## Errors in CBS logs

The CBS.log file shows one of the following two errors:

- Error 1

> [!NOTE]
> The updates that appear during the error may different. The cause of these errors is in the CBS component and the index file, not the updates themselves. The sample output and the list of updates that are mentioned in the error are based on internal testing of a default but updated Windows Server 2012 R2 Core installation that has no additional features or roles enabled.

## Cause of Error 1 in CBS logs

This issue occurs when the conversion requires files to be downloaded for updates that are bundled as a part of a single updateID.

Local testing shows that presence of the following updates on the Core server will cause the conversion to fail with the DPX Extraction 0x80070002 errors:

- 3000850
- 3003057
- 3014442
- 2919355
- 2959977

> [!NOTE]
> To see sample values for updateID, open the wuindex.xml file under the %windir%\servicing\packages path, and search for the updateID string.

## Cause of Error 2 in CBS logs

The cause is the entry \<Map Package="package_for_kb2959977~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.1"/> is missed under updateID 8452bac0-bf53-4fbd-915d-499de08c338b, inside the file %windir%\servicing\packages\wuindex.xml.
