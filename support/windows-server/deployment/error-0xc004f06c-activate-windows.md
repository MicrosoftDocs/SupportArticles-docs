    0xC004F06C, 0x00000000, azkms.core.windows.net:1688, <CMID>, <DateTime>, 1, 5, 0, 34e1ae55-27f8-4950-8877-7a03be5fb181,

This error occurs in one of the following conditions:

- The Windows Time service isn't working.
- The `NtpClient` time provider isn't enabled.
- Domain-joined computers don't sync time with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).

To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. Make sure the Windows Time service is running.
    1. Type *services.msc* in the **Search** box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to open the **Services** window.
    2. Search for **Windows Time** and make sure the service is running.
    3. Run the following command from an elevated command prompt to make sure the service is working properly:

        ```console
        w32tm.exe /query /status /verbose
        ```

2. For non-domain-joined computers, use the Network Time Protocol (NTP) time source by enabling the `NtpClient` provider.

    [!INCLUDE [Registry important alert](../../includes/registry-important-alert.md)]

    1. Open Registry Editor and go to the following registry key:

        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpClient`

    2. Change the value of the **Enabled** registry entry to **1** to enable the `NtpClient` provider in the current time service.

3. For domain-joined computers, use the AD DS time source by configuring the time client type.

    1. Open Registry Editor and go to the following registry key:

        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\Parameters`.

    2. Make sure the value of the **Type** registry entry is **NT5DS**. This means the computer is synchronizing its time with the AD DS time hierarchy.
