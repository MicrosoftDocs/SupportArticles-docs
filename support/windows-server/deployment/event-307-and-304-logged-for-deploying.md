# Event ID 307 and Event ID 304 are logged after you deploy Windows on a device

This article provides a resolution for the event ID 307 and 304 that are logged when you deploy Windows on a device.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions, Windows Server 2019  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4480781

## Symptom

When you deploy Windows on a device, these events are logged:

```output
Log Name: Microsoft-Windows-User Device Registration/Admin  
Source: User Device Registration  
Event ID: 307  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Automatic registration failed. Failed to lookup the registration service information from Active Directory. Exit code: Unknown HResult Error code: 0x801c001d. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=623042
```

```output
Log Name: Microsoft-Windows-User Device Registration/Admin  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-User Device Registration  
Event ID: 304  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Automatic registration failed at join phase.  Exit code: Unknown HResult Error code: 0x801c001d. Server error:. Debug Output:\r\n undefined.
```

Here is an example of the event IDs:

## Cause

These event IDs occur when the infrastructure isn't prepared for [Hybrid join](/azure/active-directory/devices/hybrid-azuread-join-federated-domains). When the device tries to do Hybrid join, the registration fails, and the events are logged.

## Resolution

If the infrastructure is in a non-Hybrid join environment, these event IDs are expected during Windows 10 deployment. They can be ignored.

If you have a Hybrid scenario, see [Troubleshooting hybrid Azure Active Directory joined Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/troubleshoot-hybrid-join-windows-current) for troubleshooting steps.
