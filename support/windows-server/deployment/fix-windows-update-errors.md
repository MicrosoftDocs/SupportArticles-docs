# Fix Windows Update errors by using the DISM or System Update Readiness tool

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1809 and later versions, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 947821

## Symptom

Windows updates and service packs may fail to install if there are [corruption errors](#description-of-the-common-corruption-errors). For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or [System Update Readiness tool](#what-does-the-system-update-readiness-tool-do) may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.

This article is intended for Support agents and IT professionals. If you are home users and looking for more information about fixing Windows update errors, see [Fix Windows Update errors](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10164).

## Resolution for Windows 8.1, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012 R2

To resolve this problem, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.

1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, open **Start** menu or **Start** screen, type *Command Prompt*, right-select **Command Prompt**, and then select **Run as administrator**. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or select **Allow**.

2. Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the *C:\RepairSource\Windows* placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference [Repair a Windows Image](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824869(v=win.10)).

3. Type the `sfc /scannow` command and press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

4. Close the command prompt, and then run **Windows Update** again.

DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.

## Resolution for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

To resolve this problem, use the System Update Readiness tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.

1. Download the System Update Readiness tool.

    select the download link in the following table that corresponds to the version of Windows that is running on your computer.

## What does the System Update Readiness tool do

### Verify the integrity of resources

The System Update Readiness tool verifies the integrity of the following resources:

- Files that are located in the following directories:
  - %SYSTEMROOT%\Servicing\Packages
  - %SYSTEMROOT%\WinSxS\Manifests
- Registry data that is located under the following registry subkeys:
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Components
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Schema
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing

This list may be updated at any time.

When the System Update Readiness tool detects incorrect manifests, Cabinets, or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with a corrected version.

### Logging

The System Update Readiness tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located here:

- %SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log
- %SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log

## How to fix errors that are found in the CheckSUR log file

To manually fix corruption errors that the System Update Readiness tool detects but can't fix, follow these steps:

1. Open %SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log.

    > [!NOTE]
    > %SYSTEMROOT% is an environment variable that saves the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, generally the %SYSTEMROOT% folder is C:\Windows.

2. Identify the packages that the tool can't fix. For example, you may find the following in the log file:

    > Summary:
    >
    > Seconds executed: 264  
    > Found 3 errors  
    > CBS MUM Missing Total Count: 3  
    > Unavailable repair files:  
    >
    > servicing\packages\Package_for_KB958690_sc_0~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.0.1.6.mum  
    > ...

    In this case, the package that is corrupted is KB958690.

3. Download the package from [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download) or [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx).

4. Copy the package (.msu) to the `%SYSTEMROOT%\CheckSUR\packages` directory. By default, this directory doesn't exist and you need to create the directory.
5. Rerun the System Update Readiness tool.

If you are a technical professional, see [How to fix errors found in the CheckSUR.log](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2700601) for a more option on fixing errors in the CheckSUR.log.
