## More information

After you rebuild theTokens.dat file, you must reinstall your product key by using one of the following methods:

- At the same elevated prompt command, type the following command, and then press **Enter**:
  
    `cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /ipk \<product key>`

- Right-click **My Computer**, select **Properties**, and then select **Change product key**.
