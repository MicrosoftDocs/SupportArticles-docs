# SYSPREP and CAPTURE task sequence fails with error 0x80070070

This article helps fix a 0x80070070 error that occurs when Deployment Toolkit fails to complete sysprep and capture task sequence.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2670374

## Symptoms

Microsoft Deployment Toolkit fails to complete sysprep and capture task sequence if there is a drive letter assigned to the first partition or there is no enough free space available in first partition. Following details with error are shown in Summary screen.

> ZTI ERROR - Unhandled error returned by LTIApply: (-2147024784 0x80070070)  
Litetouch deployment failed, Returned Code = -2147467259 0x80004005  
Messages from the task sequence engine:  
Failed to run the action: Apply Windows PE.  
There is not enough space on the disk. (Error: 80070070; Source: Windows)  
The execution of the group (Capture Image) has failed and the execution has been aborted.  
An action failed.

Failed to run the last action: Apply Windows PE. Execution of task sequence failed.

In BDD.log we can see following information:

> --- Applying bootable Windows PE Image -----  
LTI applying Windows PE  
Will boot into Windows PE architecture x64 to match OS being deployed.
Copying \\\\Server\\Deploymentshare\\Boot\\LiteTouchPE_x64.wim to E:\\sources.boot.wim  
MDT was copying the LiteTouchPE.wim to E:\\LiteTouchPE.wim that is the first partition in hard drive.

## Cause

By default MDT copies the LiteTouchPE.wim from the deployment share to the first partition (which has a drive letter assigned) in the hard drive to complete the sysprep and capture task sequence. In the above example, the drive letter was assigned as E:\\ for 'System Reserved' partition.

## Resolution

To resolve this particular issue, follow the below steps:

- Do not assign any drive letter to the 'System Reserved' partition, so that MDT can copy to next partition that has the drive letter.
- This issue can also occur if you do not have free space in the C drive, wherein C drive is the first partition.

## More information

By default Windows 7 is installed from a media or WDS, you will have first partition as 'System Reserved' partition of 100-MB size, on the disk selected (generally disk 0) and it will NOT have a drive letter assigned. If the image is deployed from MDT (2010), then the 'System Reserved' partition will be 300 MB and will be allocated after the OS partition.
