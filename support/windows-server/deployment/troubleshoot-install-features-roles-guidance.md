This guidance is designed to help troubleshoot issues when adding or removing roles and features in Windows.

## Troubleshooting checklist

1. Check errors in the Windows event log, especially the System event log and the Windows Setup event log. For example, navigate to the following location in Event Viewer and search for Event IDs in the range of 4000 to 4099.

   *Applications And Services Logs\Microsoft\Windows\ServerManager-MultiMachine*

2. Try to add or remove a different role or feature. This method will help to determine if the issue is specific to a role or feature.

3. Verify the state of the component store for any corruption.

   1. Run the following command to repair the Windows image. For more information, see [Repair a Windows image](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/repair-a-windows-image).

      `Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

   2. The results are logged in the following log file:

      *%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log*

   3. In the log file, search for the following line:

      `Checking System Update Readiness`

4. After verifying the component store and fixing any corruption, run the `SFC /scannow` command at an elevated command prompt to scan and restore Windows files. For more information, see [Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files](https://support.microsoft.com/help/929833).
