## More information

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

You can identify the name of the correct language pack to install by looking up the language ID.

You can find the language ID in the Windows registry. To do it, start Registry Editor, and then look under the following registry subkey:  
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NTDS\Language`

You can also search for the language ID in the [LCID-Locale Mapping Table](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/a29e5c28-9fb9-4c49-8e43-4b9b8e733a05). For the example language ID (411) that is mentioned in the [Summary](#summary) section, the value indicates the Japanese language (listed as **0411** in the mapping table).

For information about which sort object identifiers (OIDs) the sort control uses, see [LDAP_SERVER_SORT_OID and LDAP_SERVER_RESP_SORT_OID](/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/6b7b93f1-7c1a-45c2-9544-c067b94bba20).
