You can find the shortcut to start the WSUS 3.0 Administration Console in the Administrative Tools folder. In Windows XP with SP2 and in Windows Vista, the Administrative Tools folder is in Control Panel.

#### Important configuration issue

If you use a proxy server that requires authentication, you must overwrite the proxy server password in the WSUS Server Configuration Wizard. If you do not do it, the WSUS server may not synchronize updates. Because the configuration wizard starts automatically at the end of the Setup process, this problem can cause synchronization errors after you upgrade to WSUS 3.0. You can avoid this problem by canceling the Configuration Wizard after the upgrade or by reentering the correct proxy password when the wizard runs. To recover from this problem after it has occurred, follow these steps:  

1. In the WSUS 3.0 console tree, click **Options**.
2. In the details pane, click **Update Source and Proxy Server**.
3. In the **Update Source and Proxy Server** dialog box, click the **Proxy Server** tab.
4. Reenter the proxy password. Then, save the setting.
