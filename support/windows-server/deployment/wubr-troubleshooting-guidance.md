# Windows Update for Business reports: Troubleshooting guidance

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server, all supported versions

This article is designed to help get you started on troubleshooting issues that you might encounter when you use Windows Update for Business reports.

## Troubleshooting checklist

Here's a list of the basic steps to resolve most Windows Update for Business reports issues:

- Verify that you belong to the correct roles:
  - Azure: Either the Log Analytics Reader or Log Analytics Contributor Azure role.  
  - Microsoft Entra: An administrative role.  

  At a high level, Azure roles control permissions to manage Azure resources, while Microsoft Entra roles control permissions to manage Microsoft Entra ID resources. For more information, see [Windows Update for Business reports prerequisites: Permissions](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-reports-prerequisites#permissions).
- Verify that at least one device is sending telemetry, especially if you received a successful save message during enrollment but still haven't seen any data after 48 hours. If no devices are sending telemetry, run the [configuration script](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-reports-configuration-script) on the clients to make sure that they're active and configured correctly.
- Verify that the devices are [Microsoft Entra joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join) or [Microsoft Entra hybrid joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid).
- Verify that the devices are turned on, active, and can scan for Windows updates. To be included in reports, a device must have been active at least one time in the past 28 days.
- Make sure that each device has the **Allow device name to be sent in Windows diagnostic data** policy enabled.
- Check the size of the report. For performance, the default limit for rows in Azure workbooks is set to 1,000. If your report has more than 1,000 rows, do one of the following:
  - Export the report data to Excel to view the whole report.
  - To view the information in Logs view, select the three-dot icon that's next to the component of interest.
  - Check the policy configuration.

## Common issues and solutions

### Stuck at the "Waiting for Windows Update for Business reports data" page

This issue has several potential causes. To resolve the issue, check the following:  

- Verify that you belong to the correct roles:
  - Azure: Either the Log Analytics Reader or Log Analytics Contributor Azure role.
  - Microsoft Entra: An administrative role.  

  At a high level, Azure roles control permissions to manage Azure resources, and Microsoft Entra roles control permissions to manage Microsoft Entra resources. For more information, see [Windows Update for Business reports prerequisites: Permissions](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-reports-prerequisites#permissions).
- Verify that at least one device is sending telemetry, especially if you received a successful save message during enrollment but still haven't seen any data after 48 hours. If no devices are sending telemetry, run the [configuration script](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-reports-configuration-script) on the clients to make sure that they're active and configured correctly.
- If the preceding solutions don't apply or don't resolve the issue, use the Configuration flyout of your administrative console to unenroll and re-enroll. Wait for 24â€“48 hours. If the issue persists, contact Microsoft Support.

### Devices are missing from reports

This issue has several potential causes. To resolve the issue, check the following:

- Verify that the devices are [Microsoft Entra joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join) or [Microsoft Entra hybrid joined](/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-ad-join-hybrid).
- Verify that the devices are sending telemetry. If the missing devices aren't sending telemetry, run the configuration script to make sure that they're active and configured correctly.
- Verify that the devices are turned on, active, and can scan for Windows updates. To be included in reports, a device must have been active at least one time in the past 28 days.
- Check the size of the report. For performance, the default limit for rows in Azure workbooks is set to 1,000. If your report has more than 1,000 rows, do one of the following:  

  - Export the report data to Excel to view the whole report.
  - To view the information in Logs view, select the three-dot icon that's next to the component of interest.
