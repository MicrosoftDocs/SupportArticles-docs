# Use Group Policy to disable USB, CD-ROM, Floppy Disk, and LS-120 drivers

This article describes an ADM template that allows an Administrator to disable the respective drivers of these devices.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2003  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 555324

## Symptoms

By default, Group Policy doesn't offer a facility to easily disable drives containing removable media, such as USB ports, CD-ROM drives, Floppy Disk drives, and high capacity LS-120 floppy drives. But Group Policy can be extended to use customized settings by applying an ADM template. The ADM template in this article allows an Administrator to disable the respective drivers of these devices, ensuring that they can't be used.

## Resolution

Import this administrative template into Group Policy as an .adm file. See the link in the "More information" section if you're unsure how to do this.

## More information

For more information about applying Administrative Template files, including instructions on how to use the above template, download the Microsoft White Paper 'Using Administrative Template Files with Registry-Based Group Policy' from here.

This template is considered a preference rather than a true policy and will tattoo the registry of client computers with its settings. If this template is moved out of scope of the Group Policy that applies it, the registry changes that it makes will remain. If you wish to reverse the settings made by this template, reverse the options to re-enable the drivers.

Preference settings are hidden by default in the Group Policy template editor. When applying this template, follow these instructions to change the view settings that allow preferences to be viewed.
