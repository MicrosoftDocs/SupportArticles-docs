# A Group Policy setting isn't available in the security policy settings list

This article describes a problem in which the "System objects: Default owner for objects created by members of the Administrators group" Group Policy setting isn't available in the security policy settings list. 

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 947721

## Symptoms

When you try to access the "System objects: Default owner for objects created by members of the Administrators group" Group Policy setting on a computer that is running Windows Vista or newer, this setting isn't available in the security policy settings list.

When the setting is present in your security group policy, it will be ignored by Windows Vista and newer domain members.

## Cause

Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 don't support this setting any longer. When enabled, User Account Control (UAC) will ensure the user account is being used as owner for all objects created locally. For remote access, the administrators' group will be used there's no restricted token for network sessions.

Since the support for the setting was removed, the system security policy "System objects: Default owner for objects created by members of the Administrators group" setting isn't available in the Security Templates user interface anymore.

## Resolution

You can add the "System objects: Default owner for objects created by members of the Administrators group" Group Policy setting to the Security Templates user interface.

Hint: This procedure will NOT make Windows Vista and newer honor the setting as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 do.
