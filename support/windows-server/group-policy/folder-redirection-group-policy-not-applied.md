# User Profiles and Folder Redirection group policies aren't applied

This article helps fix an issue that prevents User Profiles and folder redirection policies from working in Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3060058

## Symptoms

Computers running Windows 8 and later versions may not apply User Profiles and Folder Redirection Group Policy objects (GPOs) as expected. This issue can occur if the computers are domain clients and are managed by System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Service Pack 1 (ConfigMgr 2012 SP1) or later.

## Resolution

To work around this issue, disable the **Enable User Data and Profiles** device setting in the System Center 2012 Configuration Manager console.
