# Information about Group Policy Preferences events

This article provides some information about Group Policy Preferences Events.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2002507

## Summary

Group Policy Preferences (GPP) allow you to specify computer and user configuration settings. These settings allow granular configuration not available using regular Group Policy. GPP also provides filtering of settings using item-level targeting that allows for granular application of settings to a subset of users or computers.  

You may want to know about the possible events that can be logged by a component, in order to categorize them properly in system management solutions. Below you will find the list of events for Group Policy Preferences.

## More information

Group Policy Preferences events are written to the Application log. Informational events are only logged when the relevant Group Policy settings are enabled. The path to the settings per preference area is:
