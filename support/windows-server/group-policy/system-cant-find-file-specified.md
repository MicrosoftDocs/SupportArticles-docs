# Adprep /gpprep error (The system cannot find the file specified), or tool crashes

This article provides a solution to errors that occur when you use the Adprep tool together with the `/gpprep` argument.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2743345

## Symptoms

You use the Adprep tool together with the `/gpprep` argument in Windows Server 2012 R2. For example, you run the following arguments:
  
`adprep.exe /domainprep /gpprep`

When you do this, you receive the following error:

> Domain-wide information has already been updated.  
[Status/Consequence]  
Adprep did not attempt to rerun this operation.  
>
> Adprep is about to upgrade the Group Policy Object (GPO) information on the Infrastructure Master FSMO `dc1.corp.contoso.com`.
>
> Gpprep operation 3 failed.  
[Status/Consequence]  
Upgrade of domain Group Policy Objects failed.  
[User Action]  
Check the log file ADPrep.log and gpprep.log in the C:\Windows\debug\adprep\logs\20120809082547 directory for possible cause of failure.  
>
> Adprep encountered a Win32 error.  
Error code: 0x2 Error message: The system cannot find the file specified.
>
> Group policy upgrade failed.  
[Status/Consequence]  
Upgrade of domain Group Policy Objects failed.  
[User Action]  
Check the log file ADPrep.log in the C:\Windows\debug\adprep\logs\20120809082547 directory for possible cause of failure.
>
> Adprep encountered a Win32 error.  
Error code: 0x2 Error message: The system cannot find the file specified.

If you use the Adprep.exe that is included with Windows Server 2012 R2, Adprep.exe crashes, and you receive an error that resembles the following:

## Cause

The infrastructure operations master role holder in this domain implements a disjoint namespace. Adprep.exe assumes that computer names will match their domain names because this match is the default behavior in all versions of Windows.

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> All steps require membership in the Domain Admins group. Also, run commands at an elevated command prompt.

1. Locate the infrastructure master role holder in the domain. To do this, run the command: `netdom.exe query fsmo`.

2. Disable incoming and outgoing (also known as *inbound and outbound*) replication on server with the Infrastructure Master role. To do this, run the following command:

    ```console
    repadmin.exe /options <infrastructure_master_name> +DISABLE_OUTBOUND_REPL +DISABLE_INBOUND_REPL
    ```

3. Log on to server with the Infrastructure Master role, and modify its Domain Name System (DNS) suffix. To do this, follow these steps:
    1. Start SYSDM.CPL, select **OK**, select **Change**, and then select **More**  
    2. Set the suffix in the **Primary DNS suffix of this computer** box to match the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain name instead of the current disjointed name.

4. Restart and log on to server with the Infrastructure Master role, and then run the command: `adprep.exe /domainprep /gpprep`.

5. Use SYSDM.CPL, and then follow the steps in step 3, except this time in step 3B, you must set the suffix in the **Primary DNS suffix of this computer** box to match the original disjoint name on server with the Infrastructure Master role.

6. Restart and then log on to server with the Infrastructure Master role, and enable inbound and outbound replication. To do this, use the following command:

    ```console  
    repadmin.exe /options <infrastructure_master_name> -DISABLE_OUTBOUND_REPL -DISABLE_INBOUND_REPL
    ```

## More information

Gpprep adds cross-domain planning functionality for Group Policy and Resultant Set of Policy (RSOP) Planning Mode. Adding this functionality requires updating the file system in SYSVOL and AD DS permissions for existing group policies. The environment may already contain custom or delegated permissions that were manually implemented by administrators. In this case, gpprep triggers replication of all Group Policy files in SYSVOL and may deny RSOP functionality to delegated users until their permissions are recreated by administrators. So Administrators should run gpprep only one time in the history of a domain. Gpprep shouldn't be run with every upgrade.

Notes

- Gpprep was introduced in Windows Server 2003.
- Disjoint namespaces aren't a Microsoft best practice.
