# You are unable to join a node into a cluster if UDP port 3343 is blocked

This article provides a solution to an issue where users are unable to join a node into a cluster if UDP port 3343 is blocked.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2455128

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- On a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2.
- You attempt to join the node into a cluster.

In this scenario, you may not be able to join the node into the cluster and you may receive the following error in system event log:

> Log Name:      System  
Source:        Microsoft-Windows-FailoverClustering  
Date:          \<date>  
Event ID:      1572  
Task Category: Cluster Virtual Adapter  
Level:         Critical  
Keywords:  
User:          SYSTEM  
Computer:      \<computer>  
Description:  
Node \<computer> failed to join the cluster because it could not send and receive failure detection network messages with other cluster nodes. Please run the Validate a Configuration wizard to ensure network settings. Also verify the Windows Firewall 'Failover Clusters' rules.  

## Cause

Cluster nodes communicate over User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 3343. The issue may occur because the UDP port 3343 is not opened.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, open the required UDP port 3343 on the cluster.

## More information  

This is a sample cluster log. The UDP port 3343 on the cluster is blocked:

You can confirm the UDP port 3343 by command `netstat -ano`.
