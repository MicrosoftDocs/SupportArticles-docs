# Cluster validation account causes events or messages

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2016, all editions, Windows Server 2012 R2 Datacenter

## Symptoms

In a failover clustering environment, when you run the cluster validation process, Windows creates a new user account. After this occurs, you might notice security events or messages that describe this account. The account is temporary. Windows removes the account when the cluster validation process ends.

## More information

During the cluster validation process, Windows creates a user account that has the following properties:

- User name: **CliTest2**
- Password: 12 characters
- Group memberships: None

The cluster validation process uses this account to connect to clustered shares across cluster nodes. When the cluster validation process ends, Windows deletes the account.
