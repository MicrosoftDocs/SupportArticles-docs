_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2973100

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- In Windows Server 2008, you open Windows Explorer, you right-click a drive, and then you click **Properties**.

Event ID: 12311
Task Category: None
Level: Error
Description:
Volume Shadow Copy Service error: Unexpected error pResource->get_Disk(&pDisk): hr = 0x80070490.

## Cause

This problem occurs if there are disk resources in the failover cluster that don't have a physical disk resource associated with them. This behavior may occur if you take a disk resource offline and remove the associated disk from the server, but you don't delete the disk resource in the failover cluster.

## Resolution

In the failover cluster, delete the disk resource that no longer has a physical disk associated with it.
