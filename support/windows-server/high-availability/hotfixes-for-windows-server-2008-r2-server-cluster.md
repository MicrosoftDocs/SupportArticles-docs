# Recommended hotfixes and updates for Windows Server 2008 R2-based server clusters

This article describes the hotfixes and updates that we recommend that you install on each node of a Windows Server 2008 R2-based failover cluster.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2008 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 980054

## Summary

When you update your Windows Server 2008 R2-based failover cluster, you help reduce downtime. You also help decrease the number of errors, failed print jobs, and other support issues that you experience.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you evaluate these hotfixes and updates to determine whether they might resolve problems in your environment. If you determine that cluster nodes that are in your environment may be affected by the problems that an update or hotfix addresses, install the hotfix or update on each cluster node that is in your environment.

Use the information in the [More information](#more-information) section to help you determine whether a particular hotfix or update applies to the server cluster. Before you install a particular hotfix or update, we recommend that you review the original Microsoft Knowledge Base (KB) article that describes that hotfix or update.

## More information

We recommend that you install Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1 (SP1), as it has many fixes for problems with Windows Clustering. We also recommend installing the hotfixes that are referenced in [Recommended hotfixes and updates for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 Failover Clusters](updates-for-windows-server-2008-r2-sp1-failover-cluster.md). If for any reason you cannot immediately apply SP1, we recommend that you install the following Windows Server 2008 R2 hotfixes, depending on your environment.
