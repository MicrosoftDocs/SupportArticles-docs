# Recommended hotfixes and updates for Windows Server 2012 R2-based failover clusters

This article describes the hotfixes that are currently available for Windows Server 2012 R2-based failover clusters and are highly recommended to be installed on each server of a failover cluster.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2920151

## Summary

Failover Cluster Management enables multiple servers to provide a high availability of server roles. Failover Cluster Management is frequently used for file services, virtual machines, database applications, and mail applications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The process for installing service packs and hotfixes for Windows Server 2012 R2 differs from the process for earlier versions of Windows Server. In Windows Server 2012 R2, you can use the Cluster-Aware Updating (CAU) feature. CAU automates the software-updating process on clustered servers and maintains availability. For more information, see [Cluster-Aware Updating Overview](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831694(v=ws.11)).

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base articles describe the currently available fixes that are highly recommended to be installed on all failover clusters. Most of the updates apply to computers that are running Windows Server 2012 R2. Some updates, such as [KB 976424](https://support.microsoft.com/help/976424), may be required on computers that are running Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 2008 if those operating systems are present in the environment.

These updates are considered to be important installations to ensure the highest level of reliability.

## Any Windows Server 2012 R2 cluster

> [!NOTE]
> You may substitute a newer monthly rollup in place of KB 4282815. The remainder of the updates in this list are still needed as some components in those updates released before September 2016 and are not included in the newer monthly rollup.
