- Dcpromo.exe fails and generates error 8451.  
    The user interface displays the following message:  
    >The operation failed because:
    >
    >Active Directory Domain Services could not replicate the directory partition
    \<DN path of failing partition> from the remote Active Directory Domain Controller
    \<helper DC>.\<dns domain name>.\<top level domain>.
    >
    >The replication operation encountered a database error.  

    The Dcpromo.log file contains the following information:  
    >\<date> \<time> [INFO] NstdInstall for contoso.com returned 8451  
    \<date> \<time> [INFO] DsRolepInstallDs returned 8451

    \<date> \<time> [INFO] Starting service NETLOGON
- Repadmin.exe reports that the replication attempt has failed with status 8451. Repadmin.exe commands that commonly cite the 8451 status include but are not limited to:  

  - `Repadmin /kcc`
  - `Repadmin /rehost`
  - `Repadmin /replicate`
  - `Repadmin /replsum`
  - `Repadmin /showrepl`
  - `Repadmin /showreps`
  - `Repadmin /showutdvec`
  - `Repadmin /syncall`

    For detailed information about how to use Repadmin to troubleshoot replication problems, see [Monitoring and Troubleshooting Active Directory Replication Using Repadmin](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122830).

    The following sample shows output from the `repadmin /showreps` command that indicates that inbound replication from CONTOSO-DC2 to CONTOSO-DC1 failed and generated the "replication access was denied" message.

- When you run the Dcdiag.exe utility, it produces output that resembles as:  

    >Starting test: Replications
    >
    >\* Replications Check  
    [Replications Check,\<DC Name>] A recent replication attempt
    failed:  
    From \<source DC> to \<destination DC>  
    Naming Context: \<DN path of failing naming context>  
    The replication generated an error (8451):  
    The replication operation encountered a database error  

- In Active Directory Sites and Services, when you right-click the connection object of a source DC and select **Replicate now**, the command fails and generates a message that resembles as:  

    >The following error occurred during the attempt to synchronize naming context <%directory partition name%> from Domain Controller \<Source DC> to Domain Controller \<Destination DC>:  
    "The replication operation encountered a database error."  
    The operation will not continue.

### How to decode error codes

You can use Microsoft Exchange Server Error Code Lookup to decode the error codes that are described in this article. Decoding the error codes that relate to the 8451 error and accompanying errors produces the following information:

## Cause

The status 8451: "The replication operation encountered a database error" has multiple root causes, including the following ones:  

- The Active Directory database or Active Directory database index might be corrupted. It may be caused by the following reasons:
  - Failing hardware:
    - Disk
    - Controller
    - Controller cache
  - Outdated drivers:
    - Controller
  - Outdated firmware:
    - Computer BIOS
    - Controller
    - Disk
  - Sudden power loss.
  - Lingering objects.
  - The long-value ID counter has reached its maximum value:
    - The ESE column types `JET_coltypLongText`and `JET_coltypLongBinary` are called long value column types. These columns are large string and large binary objects that may be stored in separate B+ trees away from the primary index. When long values are stored separately from the primary record, they are internally keyed on a long value ID (LID).
  - Invalid security descriptor in the **msExchSecurityDescriptor** attribute.

## Resolution

> [!Important]
> Follow the steps in this section carefully. Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Before you modify it, [back up the registry for restoration](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756) in case problems occur.

### How to resolve a single occurrence of the problem

If the error occurs on only one domain controller and appears to be an isolated problem, the best and quickest resolution is to do offline defragmentation of the database on the affected server. For information about how to do it, see [How to perform offline defragmentation of the Active Directory database](https://support.microsoft.com/help/232122/how-to-perform-offline-defragmentation-of-the-active-directory-databas).  

If offline defragmentation does not correct the issue, demote and then repromote the affected domain controller. For information about how to do it, see [Demoting Domain Controllers and Domains](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/deploy/demoting-domain-controllers-and-domains--level-200-).

### How to resolve a recurring problem

If the problem recurs, collect some diagnostic data.  

1. Enable NTDS diagnostic logging for Replication Events and Internal Processing at a level of 5.

    To increase NTDS diagnostic logging, change the following REG_DWORD values in the registry of the destination domain controller under the following registry subkey:  
 `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Diagnostics`  

    Set the value of the following entries to **5**:  
   - Replication Events
   - Internal Processing  

    > [!Note]
    > Level-5 logging is extremely verbose. The values of both keys should be restored to the default of **0** after the problem is resolved. Filtering the Directory Services event log should be done to isolate and identify these events.  

    For more information about the standard terminology that is used to describe Microsoft software updates, see the following Knowledge Base article:

2. Review the event logs for the new events that were generated from the increased logging for error values that will give a definitive view of the original 8451 error. For example, an Internal Processing Event ID 1173 that has an error value of **-1526** would indicate that we have a corruption in long-value tree.
3. Based on the additional information from the increased logging, refer to the following table for a potential resolution.

    |Decimal code|Hex code|Text code|Error message|Potential resolutions|
    |---|---|---|---|---|

4. If all these methods fail, restore the domain controller from a backup, or demote it and then repromote.

## More information

Verify the vertical jet database stack from the bottom up (proceeding up to the next layer only after the underlying layer is graded as "good"), the same as you do for TCP.  

|Layer|Ntdsutil command|Esentutl command|
|---|---|---|
|(1) Physical consistency|no equivalent| `Esentutl /k` |
|(2) Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) logical consistency| **Ntdsutil**, **files**, **integrity**| **Esentutl /g** |
|(3) Application logical consistency| **Ntdsutil**, **semantic database analysis** + **Ntdsutil**, **compact**|no equivalent for SDA  + **Esentutl /d** |
