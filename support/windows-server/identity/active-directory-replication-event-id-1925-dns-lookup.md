# Active Directory replication Event ID 1925: attempt to establish a replication link failed due to DNS lookup problem

This article helps to resolve the issue where you get Event ID 1925 with the error message that DNS lookup failed, inbound replication of a directory partition has failed on the destination domain controller.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4469659

This problem typically occurs when an attempt to establish a replication link fails as a result of a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup problem. If you receive Event ID 1925 with the error message that DNS lookup failed, inbound replication of a directory partition has failed on the destination domain controller, and you must fix the DNS problem.

The following is an example of the event text:
