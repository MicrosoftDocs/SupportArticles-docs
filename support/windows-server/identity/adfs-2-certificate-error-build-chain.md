## Resolution

To resolve this problem, follow these steps in the order given. These steps will help you to determine the cause of the problem. Make sure that you check whether the problem is resolved after every step.

### Step 1: Check for private keys  

Check whether all AD FS certificates (Service communications, token-decrypting, and token-signing) are valid and have a private key associated with them. Also, make sure that the certificate is within its validity period.

:::image type="content" source="media/adfs-2-certificate-error-build-chain/check-the-certificate.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Certificate window showing the validity period.":::

#### Where to find the certificates

- For Service communications certificates:  

    1. On the AD FS server, click **Start**, click Run, type MMC.exe, and then press Enter.
    2. In the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, click **OK**.
    3. On the **Certificates snap-in** screen, click the **Computer account** certificate store.  

        :::image type="content" source="media/adfs-2-certificate-error-build-chain/open-certificate-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Certificate snap-in window with Computer account selected.":::

    4. To view the properties of the Service Communications certificate, expand **Certificate (Local Computer)**, expand **Personal**, and then click **Certificates**.  

- For token-signing and token-decrypting certificates:  

  - If the certificates are self-signed certificates that are added by ADFS server by default, Logon interactively on the ADFS server using the ADFS Service account, and check the user's certificate store (certmgr.msc).
  - If the certificated are from a certificate authority (CA), configured by ADFS admins post disabling the AutoCertificateRollover, then you should be able to find it under the ADFS server's certificate store.

### Step 2: Make sure that the certificates are not using a Cryptographic Next Generation (CNG) private key  

Certificates that use the CNG private key are not supported for Token Signing and Token Decryption. If AD FS generated the self-signed certificate, that certificate does not use CNG. For a certificate that is issued by a CA, make sure that the certificate is not CNG-based. To do it, follow these steps:
If the CA template is using any of the listed cryptographic service providers, the certificate that is issued by this CA is not supported by the AD FS server.

For more information, see [How to Determine if a Certificate is Using a CAPI1 or CNG key](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/962.how-to-determine-if-a-certificate-is-using-a-capi1-or-cng-key.aspx).

### Step 3: Check whether SSL binding of the Service communication certificates in IIS is bound to port 443

#### How to check and fix

1. Start IIS Manager. To do it, click **Start**, click **Administrative Tools**, and then click **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager**.
2. Click the server name, and then expand the Sites folder.
3. Locate your website (typically, it is known as "Default Web Site"), and then select it.
4. On the **Actions** menu on the right side, click **Bindings**. Make sure that the https biding type is bound to port 443. Otherwise, click **Edit** to change the port.

### Step 4: Make sure that service communication certificate is valid, trusted, and passes a revocation check  

#### How to check  

1. Open AD FS 2.0 Management.
2. Expand **Service**, click **Certificate**, right-click the service communications certificate, and then click **View certificate**.
3. In the details pane, click **Copy to file**, and save the file as Filename.cer.
4. At a command prompt, run the following command to determine whether the service communication certificate is valid:

    ```console
    Run 'Certutil -verify -urlfetch certificate.CER > cert_cerification.txt'
    ```  

5. Open the output file that is created above "cert_verification.txt."
6. Go to the end of the file, and check whether it includes the following for a successful revocation test:  

    >Leaf certificate revocation check passed  
    CertUtil: -verify command completed successfully.

7. If the file indicates that the revocation checks failed or that the revocation server was offline, check the log to determine which certificate in the certificate chain could not be verified.

    Check whether any AIA or CDP path failed. In a scenario in which multiple paths are specified under one type of file, both paths should be marked as verified.

   >---------------- Certificate AIA ----------------  
    Verified "Certificate (0)" Time: 0  
    [0.0] `http://www.contoso.com/pki/mswww(6).crt`  
    >
    >Failed "AIA" Time: 0  
    Error retrieving URL: The server name or address could not be resolved 0x80072ee7 (WIN32: 12007)  
    `http://corppki/aia/mswww(6).crt`  
    >
    >---------------- Certificate CDP ----------------  
    Verified "Base CRL (5a)" Time: 0  
    [0.0] `http://mscrl.contoso.com/pki/crl/mswww(6).crl`  
    >
    >Verified "Base CRL (5a)" Time: 0  
    [1.0] `http://crl.contoso.com/pki/crl/mswww(6).crl`
    >
    >Failed "CDP" Time: 0  
    Error retrieving URL: The server name or address could not be resolved 0x80072ee7 (WIN32: 12007)  
    `http://corppki/crl/mswww(6).crl`  

    Collecting a network trace may help if any of the AIA or CDP or OCSP path is unavailable.

8. If the log entry indicates that the certificate is revoked, you must request another certificate that is valid and is not revoked.

### Step 5: Make sure that the ADFS service accounts has the Read permission for the private key of the ADFS certificates

#### How to check the read permission

1. On the AD FS server, click **Start**, click **Run**, enter MMC.exe, and then press Enter.
2. In the **Add/Remove Snap-in** dialog box, click **OK**.
3. In the Console Root window, click **Certificates (Local Computer)** to view the computer certificate stores.
4. Right-click the AD FS service, point to **All Tasks**, and then click **Manage private keys**.
5. Check whether the AD FS account has the Read permission.

    :::image type="content" source="media/adfs-2-certificate-error-build-chain/ad-fs-account-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the permission window which shows that the AD FS account has the Read permission.":::

### Step 6: Check whether ADFS AutoCertificateRollover feature is enabled for token-signing and token-decrypting certificates

#### How to check ADFS AutoCertificateRollover feature

- If AutoCertificateRollover is disabled, the token-signing and token-decrypting certificates will not be renewed automatically. Before these certificates expire, make sure that a new certificate is added to the AD FS configuration. Otherwise, the relying party will not trust the token that is issued by the AD FS server.
- If AutoCertificateRollover is enabled, new token-signing and token-decrypting certificates will be generated 20 days before the expiration of the old certificates. The new certificates will obtain Primary status five days after they are generated. After the new set of certificates is generated, make sure that the same information is updated on the relying party and claim provider trusts.  

For more information about the AD FS AutoCertificateRollover feature, see the following TechNet topics:

[AD FS 2.0: Understanding AutoCertificateRollover Threshold Properties](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16156.ad-fs-2-0-understanding-autocertificaterollover-threshold-properties.aspx )  

[AD FS 2.0: How to Enable and Immediately Use AutoCertificateRollover](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/1424.ad-fs-2-0-how-to-enable-and-immediately-use-autocertificaterollover.aspx )  

[AD FS 2.0: How to Replace the SSL, Service Communications, Token-Signing, and Token-Decrypting Certificates](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2554.ad-fs-2-0-how-to-replace-the-ssl-service-communications-token-signing-and-token-decrypting-certificates.aspx)  

### Step 7: Add the federation service name in the certificate SAN  

If the certificate has the SAN (Subject Alternative Name) attribute enabled, the federation service name should also be added in the SAN of the certificate, together with other names. For more information, see [SSL Certificate Requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn832693.aspx).

### Step 8: Check service account permissions for the (CN=\<GUID>,CN=ADFS,CN=Microsoft,CN=Program Data,DC=\<Domain>,DC=\<COM>) certificate sharing container  

#### How to check and fix service account permission

1. On a domain controller (DC), open Adsiedit.msc.
2. Connect to the Default naming context.
3. Locate **CN=\<GUID>,CN=ADFS,CN=Microsoft,CN=Program Data,DC=\<Domain>,DC=\<COM>**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this container name, the parameters in brackets represent the actual values. An example of a GUID is "62b8a5cb-5d16-4b13-b616-06caea706ada."  

4. Right-click the GUID, and then click **Properties**. If there is more than one GUID, follow these steps:  

    1. Start Windows PowerShell on the server that is running the AD FS service.
    2. Run the following command:  

        ```powershell
        Add-PSSnapin microsoft.adfs.powershellGet-ADFSProperties
        ```  

    3. Locate the GUID of the running AD FS service under **CertificateShareingContainer**.  

5. Make sure that the ADFS service account has the Read, Write, and "Create All child objects" permissions granted to this object and to all descendent object.

### Step 9: Check claims providers and relying parties for certificate updates

If the token-signing and token-decrypting certificates have changed, make sure that the claims providers and relying parties are updated to have the new certificates. If the claims providers and relying parties are not updated, they cannot trust the AD FS service.  

- After the change is made, share the Federationmetadata.xml with the claims provider and the relying party.
- The claims provider and the relying party might require only that the new token-signing and token-decrypting certificates (without a private key) are updated in the federation trust on their end.

### Step 10: Check for a signed request and response from the claims provider or relying party

The signed request and response might be received by the AD FS server from the claims provider or the relying party. In this scenario, the AD FS server may check the validity of the certificate that is used for signing and fail. AD FS also checks the validity of the certificate that is related to the relying party that is used to send an encrypted token to the AD FS server.

#### Scenarios

- AD FS 2.0 receives a signed SAML-P request that is sent by a relying party.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Requiring signing of sign-in requests is a configurable option. To set this requirement for a relying party trust, use the **RequireSignedSamlRequests** parameter together with the Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust cmdlet.
- AD FS 2.0 receives a signed SAML sign-out request from the relying party. In this scenario, the signout request must be signed.
- AD FS 2.0 receives a sign-out request from a claims provider, and encrypts a sign-out request for the relying party. In this scenario, the claims provider initiates the sign-out.
- AD FS 2.0 issues an encrypted token for a relying party.
- AD FS 2.0 receives an issued token from a claims provider.
- AD FS 2.0 receives a signed SAML sign-out request from a claims provider. In this scenario, the signout request must be signed.

#### What to check to resolve the issue

- Make sure that the claims provider trust's signing certificate is valid and has not been revoked.
- Make sure that AD FS 2.0 can access the certificate revocation list if the revocation setting doesn't specify "none" or a "cache only" setting.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use Windows PowerShell cmdlets for AD FS 2.0 to configure the following revocation settings:  
    >
    > - **SigningCertificateRevocationCheck** parameter of the Set-ADFSClaimsProviderTrust or Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust cmdlet
    > - **EncryptionCertificateRevocationCheck** parameter of the Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust or Set-ADFSClaimsProviderTrust cmdlet
