# Compatibility with user accounts ending with the dollar sign ($)

This article describes the potential compatibility issues in using domain user accounts ending with the dollar sign ($) as a service account.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2666116

## Summary

Starting in Windows 7/2008R2, there are potential compatibility issues with using domain user accounts ending with the dollar sign ($) as a service account. Managed service accounts are identified by ending in a dollar sign ($). The system may evaluate the account as a managed service account and block the change.

## More information

In the services console, if you enter a user account in a trusted domain that ends in the dollar sign ($), it will warn you that "The name provided is not a properly formed account name." This occurs because managed service accounts can't be used in a trusted domain.
