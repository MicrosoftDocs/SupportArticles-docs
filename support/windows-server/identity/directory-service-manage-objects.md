# Use the Directory Service command-line tools to manage Active Directory objects in Windows Server 2003  

This article describes how to use the Directory Service command-line tools to perform administrative tasks for Active Directory in Windows Server 2003. The following tasks are broken down into task groups.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Supported versions of Windows Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 322684

## How to manage users

The following sections provide detailed steps to manage groups.

### Create a New User Account

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsadd user <user_dn> -samid <sam_name>
    ```

    The following values are used in this command:

    - **user_dn** specifies the distinguished name (also known as the DN) of the user object that you want to add.
    - **sam_name** specifies the security account manager (SAM) name used as the unique SAM account name for this user (for example, Linda).

4. To specify the user account password, type the following command, where **password** is the password that is to be used for the user account:

    ```console
    dsadd user <user_dn> -pwd password
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> To view the complete syntax for this command, and to obtain more information about entering more user account information, at a command prompt, type `dsadd user /?`.

### Reset a user password

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsmod user <user_dn> -pwd <new_password>
    ```

    This command uses the following values:

    - **user_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the user for which the password will be reset.
    - **new_password** specifies the password that will replace the current user password

4. If you want to require the user to change this password at the next logon process, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsmod user <user_dn> -mustchpwd {yes|no}
    ```

If a password is not assigned, the first time the user tries to log on (by using a blank password), the following logon message is displayed:

> You are required to change your password at first logon

After the user has changed the password, the logon process continues.

You must reset the services that are authenticated with a user account if the password for the service's user account is changed.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the complete syntax for this command, and to obtain more information about entering more user account information, at a command prompt, type `dsmod user /?`.

### Disable or enable a user account

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsmod user <user_dn> -disabled {yes|no}
    ```

    This command uses the following values:

    - **user_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the user object to be disabled or enabled.
    - **{yes|no}** specifies whether the user account is disabled for logon (yes) or not (no).

> [!NOTE]
> As a security measure, instead of deleting that user's account, you can disable user accounts to prevent a particular user from logging on. If you disable user accounts that have common group memberships, you can use disabled user accounts as account templates to simplify user account creation.

### Delete a user account

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the `dsrm <user_dn>` command, where **user_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the user object to be deleted.  

After you delete a user account, all of the permissions and memberships that are associated with that user account are permanently deleted. Because the security identifier (SID) for each account is unique, if you create a new user account that has the same name as a previously deleted user account, the new account does not automatically assume the permissions and memberships of the previously deleted account. To duplicate a deleted user account, you must manually re-create all permissions and memberships.

> [!NOTE]
> To view the complete syntax for this command, and to obtain more information about entering more user account information, at a command prompt, type `dsrm /?`.

## How to manage groups

The following sections provide detailed steps to manage groups.

### Create a new group

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsadd group <group_dn> -samid <sam_name> -secgrp {yes|no} -scope {l|g|u}
    ```

    This command uses the following values:

    - **group_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the group object that you want to add.
    - **sam_name** specifies the SAM name that is the unique SAM account name for this group (for example, operators).
    - **{yes|no}** specifies whether the group you want to add is a security group (yes) or a distribution group (no).
    - **{l|g|u}** specifies the scope of the group you want to add (domain local [l], global [g], or universal [u]).

If the domain in which you are creating the group is set to the domain functional level of Windows 2000 mixed, you can select only security groups with domain local scopes or global scopes.

To view the complete syntax for this command, and to obtain more information about entering more group information, at a command prompt, type `dsadd group /?`.

### Add a member to a group

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    This command uses the following values:

    - **group_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the group object that you want to add.
    - **member_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the object that you want to add to the group.

In addition to users and computers, a group can contain contacts and other groups.

To view the complete syntax for this command, and to obtain more information about entering more user account and group information, at a command prompt, type `dsmod group /?`.

### Convert a group to another group type

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsmod group <group_dn> -secgrp {yes|no}
    ```

    This command uses the following values:

    - **group_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the group object for which you want to change the group type.
    - **{yes|no}** specifies that the group type is set to security group (yes) or distribution group (no).

To convert a group, the domain functionality must be set to Windows 2000 Native or higher. You cannot convert groups when the domain functionality is set to Windows 2000 Mixed.

To view the complete syntax for this command, at a command prompt, type `dsmod group /?`.

### Change group scope

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the following command:

    ```console
    dsmod group <group_dn> -scope {l|g|u}
    ```

    This command uses the following values:

    - **group_dn** specifies the distinguished names of the group object to which the scope will be changed.
    - **{l|g|u}** specifies the scope that the group is to be set to (local, global, or universal). If the domain is still set to Windows 2000 mixed, the universal scope is not supported. Also, it is not possible to convert a domain local group to global group or vice versa.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only change group scopes when the domain functional level is set to Windows 2000 native or higher.

### Delete a group

1. Click **Start**, and then click **Run**.
2. In the **Open** box, type *cmd*.
3. At the command prompt, type the command `dsrm <group_dn>`.

    The **group_dn** specifies the distinguished name of the group object to be deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> If you delete the group, the group is permanently removed.

By default, local groups that are provided automatically in domain controllers that are running Windows Server 2003, such as Administrators and Account Operators, are located in the Builtin folder. By default, common global groups, such as Domain Admins and Domain Users, are located in the Users folder. You can add or move new groups to any folder. Microsoft recommends that you keep groups in an organizational unit folder.

To view the complete syntax for this command, at a command prompt, type `dsrm /?`.
