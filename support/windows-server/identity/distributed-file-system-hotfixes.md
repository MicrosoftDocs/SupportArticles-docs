# List of currently available hotfixes for Distributed File System (DFS) technologies in Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2

This article lists the hotfixes that are currently available for users who have installed Distributed File System (DFS) technologies on a Windows Server 2012-based computer or a Windows Server 2012 R2-based computer.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2951262

## Summary

This Microsoft Knowledge Base articles that are listed in this article describe the available fixes. If you have installed DFS technologies on a Windows Server 2012-based computer or a Windows Server 2012 R2-based computer, we recommend that you review and install the hotfixes that are described in [More information](#more-information).

Note. The two technologies in DFS are DFS Namespaces (DFS-N) and DFS Replication (DFS-R).

A servicing approach of installing the monthly rollups provides customers with a consistent model for staying current and secure. You may substitute a more recent monthly rollup for an older monthly rollup. The remainder of the updates in this list are still required because some components in those updates were released prior to October 2016 and aren't included in a more recent monthly rollup. For more information about this servicing approach, see [Simplified servicing for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1: the latest improvements](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-blog-archive/simplified-servicing-for-windows-7-and-windows-8-1-the-latest/ba-p/166798).
