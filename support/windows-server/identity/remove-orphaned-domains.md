# How to remove orphaned domains from Active Directory  

_Original product version:_ &nbsp;Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp;230306

## Summary

Typically, when the last domain controller for a domain is demoted, the administrator selects the **This server is the last domain controller in the domain** option in the DCPromo tool. This procedure removes the domain metadata from Active Directory. This article describes how to remove domain metadata from Active Directory if this procedure isn't used, or if all domain controllers are taken offline but not demoted first.

> [!CAUTION]
> The administrator must verify that replication has occurred since the demotion of the last domain controller before manually removing the domain meta-data. Using the NTDSUTIL tool improperly can cause partial or complete loss of Active Directory functionality.

## Removing orphaned domains from Active Directory

1. Determine the domain controller that holds the Domain Naming Master Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO) role. To identify the server holding this role:
    1. Start the Active Directory Domains and Trusts Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in from the **Administrative Tools** menu.
    2. Right-click the root node in the left pane titled **Active Directory Domains and Trusts**, and then select **Operations Master**.
    3. The domain controller that currently holds this role is identified in the Current Operations Master frame.
        > [!NOTE]
        > If it's changed recently, not all computer may have received this change yet due to replication.

    For more information about FSMO roles, see [Active Directory FSMO roles in Windows](fsmo-roles.md).
2. Verify that all servers for the domain have been demoted.
3. Open a command prompt window.
4. At the command prompt, type `ntdsutil`, and then press Enter.
5. Type `metadata cleanup`, and then press Enter.
6. Type `connections`, and then press Enter. This menu is used to connect to the specific server on which the changes will occur. If the currently logged-on user isn't a member of the Enterprise Admins group, alternate credentials can be supplied by specifying the credentials to use before making the connection. To do so, type: `set creds <domainname> <username> <password>`, and then press Enter. For a null password, type *null* for the password parameter.
7. Type `connect to server <servername>`, where *\<servername>* is the name of the domain controller that holds the Domain Naming Master FSMO Role. Then press Enter. You should receive confirmation that the connection is successfully established. If an error occurs, verify that the domain controller used in the connection is available. And verify that the credentials you supplied have administrative permissions on the server.
8. Type `quit`, and then press Enter. The **Metadata Cleanup** menu is displayed.
9. Type `select operation target`, and then press Enter.
10. Type `list domains`, and then press Enter. A list of domains in the forest is displayed, each with an associated number.
11. Type `select domain <number>`, and then press Enter, where **number** is the number associated with the domain to be removed.
12. Type `quit`, and then press Enter. The **Metadata Cleanup** menu is displayed.
13. Type `remove selected domain`, and then press Enter. You should receive confirmation that the removal was successful. If an error occurs, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles on specific error messages.
14. Type `quit` at each menu to quit the NTDSUTIL tool. You should receive confirmation that the connection disconnected successfully.
