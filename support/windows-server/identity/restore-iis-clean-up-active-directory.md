# How to restore IIS and clean up Active Directory when you uninstall Active Directory Federation Services 2.0

This article describes how to restore Internet Information Services (IIS) and clean up Active Directory when you uninstall Active Directory Federation Services 2.0.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 982813

## Introduction

The Active Directory Federation Services 2.0(AD FS 2.0) uninstallation wizard uninstalls AD FS 2.0 from your computer. However, you may still have to manually restore or cleanup settings in either of the following situations:

- When you uninstall AD FS 2.0 from a federation server or federation server proxy computer, the uninstall wizard doesn't restore IIS to its original state.
- When you uninstall AD FS 2.0 from the last added federation server in a federation server farm, the uninstall process does not delete the certificate sharing container that was created in Active Directory.

If you run the AD FS 2.0 Federation Server Configuration Wizard after reinstalling AD FS 2.0 but you have not cleaned up the previous AD FS 2.0 configuration from IIS, you may see one of the following symptoms:

- The Configuration Results page may show the component Deploy browser sign-in Web site listed with status Configuration finished with warnings. When you click the status you may see the following warning:

    > Existing Web site detected. Therefore, the Web site was not reinstalled. If you are trying to redeploy the default AD FS 2.0 Web sites, see `http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=181110` for details.

- The Configuration Results page may show the component Deploy browser sign-in Web site listed with status Configuring components...  when the following error message is displayed:

    > Cannot copy the Web site files to C:\\inetpub\\adfs\\ls because the directory already exists. Either remove the directory and rerun the configuration wizard, or update the existing Web site manually.

You can use the following methods to clean up or restore the original configuration:

## Restore IIS on a federation server or federation server proxy computer

When AD FS 2.0 is installed on a computer that is configured for the federation server or federation server proxy role, it will create the /adfs and /adfs/ls virtual directories in IIS. AD FS 2.0 will also create a new application pool named ADFSAppPool. When you uninstall AD FS 2.0 from a federation server or federation server proxy computer, these virtual directories aren't removed. Additionally, the application pool is not removed. This can create problems if AD FS 2.0 is installed again on the same computer.

To manually remove these directories from the decommissioned federation server or federation server proxy computer, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, select **Administrative Tools**, and then select **IIS Manager**.

2. Expand the server name node, expand **Sites**, and then select **Default Web Site**.

3. In the **Actions** pane, select **View Applications**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You should see the following two virtual directories associated with AD FS 2.0:
    >
    > - /adfs
    > - /adfs/ls

4. Right-click the AD FS 2.0 application that is in each virtual directory, and then click **Remove**.

5. In the **Actions** pane, select **Application Pools**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You should see an application pool named **ADFSAppPool**.

6. Right-click **ADFSAppPool**, and then select **Remove**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The next two steps show how to remove the \\adfs directory from the "inetpub" directory. If you have made custom changes to the content within this directory, we recommend that you back up this content to another location before removing the directory.

7. In Windows Explorer, browse to the "inetpub" directory. This directory is located in the following path:  
    %systemdrive%\\inetpub

8. Right-click the **Adfs** directory, and then click **Delete**.

## Delete the certificate sharing container in Active Directory

When you install AD FS 2.0 and use the Federation Server Configuration Wizard to create a new Federation Server in a new Federation Server farm, the wizard will create a certificate sharing container in Active Directory. This container is used by all the federation servers in the farm. When you uninstall AD FS 2.0 from the last added federation server in a farm, this container is not deleted from Active Directory.

To manually delete this container in Active Directory, follow these steps:

1. Before you remove AD FS 2.0 from the last federation server in the farm, run the following PowerShell commands on the AD FS 2.0 STS to determine the location of the certificate sharing container in Active Directory:

    ```powershell
    Add-PsSnapin Microsoft.Adfs.Powershell  
    Get-AdfsProperties
    ```

2. Note the **CertificateSharingContainer** property in the output from the previous step.
3. Log on to a server where the ADSIEdit tool (ADSIEdit.msc) is installed.
4. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type *ADSIEdit.msc*, and then press ENTER.
5. In the ADSIEdit tool, connect to the Default naming context by following these steps:
    1. Right-click **ADSI Edit**, and then click **Connect to**.
    2. Under **Connection Point**, click **Select a well-known Naming Context**, and then select **Default naming context**.
    3. Click **OK**.
6. Expand the following node:  
    **Default naming context, {your domain partition}, CN=Program Data, CN=Microsoft, CN=ADFS**

    > [!NOTE]
    > Under **CN=ADFS**, you see a container named **CN={GUID}** for each AD FS 2.0 farm that you have deployed, where **{GUID}** matches the **CertificateSharingContainer** property that you captured by using the `Get-AdfsProperties` PowerShell command in step 1.
7. Right-click the appropriate **{GUID}** container, and then select **Delete**.
