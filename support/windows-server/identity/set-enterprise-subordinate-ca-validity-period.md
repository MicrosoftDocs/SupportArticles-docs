## Summary

You can use the following steps to give a subordinate CA a different certificate validation period than that of the parent CA. This process is divided into the following three steps:

Step 1: Set the validation period on the parent CA.
Step 2: Install the subordinate CA.
Step 3: Set the validation time back on the parent CA.

1. Set the validation period on the parent CA. To do this, use the following commands to set the desired validation period on the parent CA that will issue the certificate of the subordinate CA:

    ```console
    certutil -setreg ca\ValidityPeriod "Weeks" 
    certutil -setreg ca\ValidityPeriodUnits "3" 
    ```

2. Install the subordinate CA. Make sure that you use the parent CA that you used in step 1.
3. Reset the validation period on the parent CA that issued the certificate of the subordinate CA (for example, "2 years", which is the default value). To do this, use the following commands:

    ```console
    certutil -setreg ca\ValidityPeriod "Years" 
    certutil -setreg ca\ValidityPeriodUnits "2"
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you run `certutil -getreg ca\val*` on the subordinate CA, both the ValidityPeriod property and the ValidityPeriodUnits property are still synchronized with the parent CA, even though the subordinate CA certificate is only valid for three weeks.
