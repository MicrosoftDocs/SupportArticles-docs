## Summary

As part of a public key infrastructure (PKI) trust management procedure, some administrators may decide to remove trusted root certificates from a Windows-based domain, server, or client. However, the root certificates that are listed in the [Necessary and trusted root certificates](#necessary-and-trusted-root-certificates) section in this article are required for the operating system to operate correctly. Removal of the following certificates may limit functionality of the operating system, or may cause the computer to fail. Don't remove them.

Some certificates that are listed in the previous tables have expired. However, these certificates are necessary for backward compatibility. Even if there's an expired trusted root certificate, anything that was signed by using that certificate *before* the expiration date requires that the trusted root certificate is validated. As long as expired certificates aren't revoked, they can be used to validate anything that was signed before their expiration.
