## Symptoms

When users try to perform a Workplace Join, they receive the following error message:

> Confirm you are using the current sign-in info, and that your workplace uses this feature. Also, the connection to your workplace might not be working right now. Wait and try again.

Additionally, an administrator may see the following event details in Event Viewer:

> Event ID: 102  
Log Name: Microsoft-Windows-Workplace Join/Admin  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-Workplace Join  
Level: Error  
Description:  
Workplace Join discovery failed.
>
> Exit Code: 0x80072EE7.
>
> The server name or address could not be resolved. Could not connect to `https://EnterpriseRegistration.domainTEST.com:443/EnrollmentServer/contract?api-version=1.0`.

## Cause

This problem occurs if one of the following conditions is true:

- The currently signed-in user is from a domain that does not contain a DNS record for the DRS Service.
- A user who has a user principal name (UPN) suffix that uses the initial domain (for example, joe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) and who is not yet enabled as the mobile device management authority through Microsoft Intune for mobile device management in Office 365 tries to perform a Workplace Join.

## Resolution

### Verify DNS

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Verify the EnterpriseRegistration CNAME record for the UPN suffix of the user account. This is the part after the "@" character, such as in john@contoso.com.
2. Open a **Command Prompt** window, and then run the following command:

    ```console
    Nslookup enterpriseregistration.domain.com 
    ```

    - If you use Microsoft Entra join

      Results should return the CNAME result of EnterpriseRegistration.windows.net.

    - If you use Windows Server Workplace Join
      - Internal host should return internal ADFS node.
      - External host should return external ADFS Proxy (if present).
