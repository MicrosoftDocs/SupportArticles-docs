## Cause

This issue can occur if there are more than 65,000 files in the Windows Temp directory. The Windows Temp directory is located at *C:\Windows\Temp*. Check Windows environment variables to confirm the location of the Windows Temp directory.

## Resolution

To resolve the problem, delete the contents of the Windows Temp folder (normally *C:\Windows\Temp*), and then again try to remove the Windows Server role or feature.

## Data collection

If you need assistance from Microsoft support, we recommend you collect the information by following the steps mentioned in [Gather information by using TSS for deployment-related issues](../../windows-client/windows-troubleshooters/gather-information-using-tss-deployment.md).
