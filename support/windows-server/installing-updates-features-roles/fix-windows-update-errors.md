## Using DISM to repair Windows Update corruptions

> [!NOTE]
> The solution mentioned in this section applies to Modern Windows versions like Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or later.

To resolve Windows Update corruptions and address update installation failures, use the DISM tool. Then, install the Windows Update.

1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, open the **Start** menu, type _Command Prompt_, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then select **Run as administrator**. If you're prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or select **Yes**.

2. Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > DISM repair works best when you connect to Microsoft Update servers to fetch missing or corrupted files. When you use the proceeding command, DISM gets the files needed to fix any corruptions from Windows Update. However, if your computer can't connect to Windows Update, you can alternatively use a working Windows installation as the repair source, or you can use files from a Windows folder on a network or from a USB or DVD. Instead, use this command:

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:\\<servername>\c$\winsxs /LimitAccess
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace \<servername\> with the computer name of the computer you are using as a repair source. The repair source computer must be running the same operating system version. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference [Repair a Windows Image](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824869(v=win.10)). If the scan result is "The restore operation completed successfully", go to the next step. If not, try to [analyze the CBS.log file](#step-1-analyze-the-cbslog-file) and fix errors.

3. Type the `sfc /scannow` command and press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

4. Close the command prompt, and then run **Windows Update** again.

DISM creates a log file (_%windir%\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log_) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. _%windir%_ is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the _%windir%_ folder is _C:\\Windows_.

## How does DISM Repair work?

DISM is a command-line tool that is used to service and repair Windows images, including the Windows Recovery Environment, Windows Setup, and Windows PE (WinPE). It can also be used to repair the local Windows image on your computer.

To give you a better understanding, here's a summary of the resources that the DISM tool checks for integrity:

- Files that are located in the following directories:
  - _%SYSTEMROOT%\Servicing\Packages_
  - _%SYSTEMROOT%\WinSxS\Manifests_
- Registry data that's located under the following registry subkeys:
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Components_
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Schema_
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing_

This list may be updated at any time. When the DISM detects incorrect manifests, Cabinets, or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with a corrected version.

### Logging

The DISM tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located here:

- _%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log_
- _%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CBS.persist.log_

## Advanced guide to fix CBS corruption manually using DISM utility

### Step 1: Analyze the CBS.log file

After running the DISM commands, go to *%WinDir%\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log* to view the results. The log file provides a summary of the scan and details of any errors found.

Here's an example of the log summary:

```output
Checking System Update Readiness.
    (p)      CSI Payload Corrupt              (n)           amd64_microsoft-windows-a..modernappmanagement_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19045.3636_none_23b3b3ece690d77b\EnterpriseModernAppMgmtCSP.dll
       (p)    CBS MUM Missing                         (n)                 Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19045.4291
       (p)    CSI Manifest Corrupt             (w)    (Fixed)       wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-mmecore-acm_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19045.1_none_a12b40f4b4c7b751
    (p)      CSI Manifest Corrupt          (n)                    wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-volumecontrol_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19045.3636_none_4514b27cf12f35d5


Summary:
Operation: Detect and Repair 
Operation result: 0x800f081f
Last Successful Step: Remove staged packages completes.
Total Detected Corruption: 2
    CBS Manifest Corruption: 2
    CBS Metadata Corruption: 0

    CSI Payload Repaired: 0
    CSI Store Metadata refreshed: False
Staged Packages:
    CBS Staged packages: 0
    CBS Staged packages removed: 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> CSI Payload Corruption: This indicates that the payload file *EnterpriseModernAppMgmtCSP.dll* is corrupt.
>
> CBS MUM Missing: A required MUM file is missing from the package (*Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package*).
> 
> CSI Manifest Corruption: There were two instances of manifest corruption. One was fixed (*wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-mmecore-acm*), and the other (*wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-volumecontrol*) remains corrupt.

### Step 2: Download the missing files

1. Identify the missing or corrupted files.

    Review the *CBS.log* file to identify the missing or corrupted files. For example:

    ```output
    (p) CSI Payload Corrupt (n) amd64_microsoft-windows-a..modernappmanagement_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19045.3636_none_23b3b3ece690d77b\EnterpriseModernAppMgmtCSP.dll
    (p) CBS MUM Missing (n) Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19045.4291
    (p) CSI Manifest Corrupt (n) wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-volumecontrol_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19045.3636_none_4514b27cf12f35d5
    ```

2. Determine the version.

    To determine which update has the missing files, you can use the Update Build Revision (UBR) in the file name. For example:

    - 10.0.19045.3636 is a UBR.
    - 10.0.19045.4291 is a UBR.

    You need to find updates that have these UBR numbers. For example, if you're using Windows 10, version 22H2, find the [update history page](/windows/release-health/release-information#windows-10-release-history) and locate the UBR number (for example, 3636). Each update has a UBR number, and you can download the corresponding update.

3. Download the missing files.

    Identify and download the update packages that contain the missing files. For example, if the log indicates that `Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19045.4291` is missing, download the respective `.msu` file from the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com).

### Step 3: Extract the .msu and .cab files

To address the corrupted files identified in the *CBS.log* file, extract the missing files into a specific folder. Follow these steps to extract the `.msu` and `.cab` files by using the provided [PowerShell script](../support-tools/scripts-extract-msu-cab-files.md), and then copy the necessary files to the *C:\\temp\\Source* folder.

1. Create the necessary folders.

    Run the following command to create the *C:\\temp\\Source* folder if it doesn't exist:

    ```console
    mkdir C:\temp\Source
    ```

2. Use the instructions and script in [Scripts: Extract .msu and .cab files](../support-tools/scripts-extract-msu-cab-files.md) to extract the `.msu` files by providing the destination paths of the `.msu` files.

### Step 4: Repair the corrupted files by using the source files

1. Copy the correct versions of the corrupted files.

    Copy the correct versions of all the corrupted files that belong to this update to the *C:\\temp\\Source* folder. For example, run the following command:

    ```powershell
    Copy-Item "C:\path\extractedFiles\corruptedfile.dll" -Destination "C:\temp\Source"
    ```

    Repeat this process for each corrupted file identified in the log until all the corrupted files are copied to the *C:\\temp\\Source* folder.

2. Rerun the DISM command.

    Open a command prompt as an administrator and run the following DISM command with the `/Source` option:

    ```console
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\temp\Source\ /limit
    ```

### Step 5: Verify and confirm

1. Rerun the DISM command.

    Rerun the following DISM command to verify that the issues have been resolved:

    ```console
    DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
    ```

2. Check the *CBS.log* file.

    Review the *CBS.log* file to ensure there are no remaining errors.

### Example DISM command output

The output of the DISM restore command provides crucial information about the corruption that was detected and repaired:

```output
