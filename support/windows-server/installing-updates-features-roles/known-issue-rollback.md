# Known Issue Rollback (KIR)

Known Issue Rollback (KIR) is a robust mitigation technology that's built into Windows updates to help you safeguard and troubleshoot individual parts of the update. This capability is part of Microsoft's continuous efforts to improve the Windows update experience and make it even more reliable for organizations.

The mitigation mechanism quickly reverts a Windows update issue by affecting only the targeted change, fix, functionality, or feature that caused the problem. KIR rolls that change back to its previous behavior. All other changes that are part of that update remain intact.

This technology is available for changes applied as part of Windows updates for the supported versions of Windows on all Enterprise-managed and retail or consumer devices.

## Motivation behind KIR

To help customers stay protected and productive, Microsoft releases multiple Windows updates monthly. Historically, if a Windows update encountered an issue, the Windows user or organizational IT admin had the following options:

- Uninstall the entire update. This option prevents the organization from getting the latest security updates. As a result, the organization becomes noncompliant and less secure.
- Skip the entire update. This option prevents the organization from getting the latest security updates. As a result, the organization becomes noncompliant and less secure.
- Deploy the update and wait for the fix to become available. Depending on the issue, this option could hamper productivity.

To address security and productivity concerns, Microsoft created KIR. KIR is a technology solution that allows users to be productive while minimizing the effects on security or compliance.

KIR came together as a functionally complete system beginning in Windows 10, version 2004. Since then, most of the code changes in Microsoft's monthly updates support KIR capability.

## How KIR works at the code level

Changes that Windows updates implement have built-in runtime feature flags. At runtime, the KIR infrastructure uses the policies on the device (determined by Group Policy settings and service-delivered metadata) to determine whether to run the new code or the previous code. This approach means that if the policies or metadata indicate that there's an issue in a specific change, that change reverts to the older code behavior.

## Scenarios that KIR supports

Windows offers KIR capability on all supported versions of [Windows Server](/windows-server/get-started/windows-server-release-info) and [client](/windows/release-health/supported-versions-windows-client) platforms, beginning with Windows Server 2008 SP2. Most of the servicing fixes on Windows use the KIR capability as a mitigation strategy.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> KIR only affects non-security updates and fixes. Security updates and fixes don't use KIR.

To find out if KIR can mitigate your regression issue, see [Ways for enterprises to discover KIR Group Policies](#ways-for-enterprises-to-discover-kir-gp).

## How KIR activates

For the purpose of KIR activation, Windows devices belong to two different categories. Each category has its own process for activating KIR.

- **Enterprise-managed devices:** Enterprise-managed devices are [update-managed Windows devices](/windows/deployment/update/update-managed-unmanaged-devices#what-are-update-managed-windows-devices). Microsoft provides a Group Policy template for the organization's IT administrator. To activate KIR, the IT administrator applies the template to the organization's Group Policy infrastructure.
- **Retail and consumer devices:** Retail and consumer devices are devices that aren't considered update-managed Windows devices. Typically, these devices aren't managed by an IT admin. These devices receive policy changes for activating KIR through the Microsoft-managed Windows Update cloud service.

### KIR for Enterprise-managed devices

As an enterprise IT admin for these devices, you're in control. In accordance with Microsoft policy, for enterprise-managed devices, Microsoft publishes a specific Group Policy template on the Download Center. You can download this Group Policy template, and then configure and apply the template to activate KIR.

> [!NOTE]  
> [Group Policy](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-policy/group-policy-overview) is a feature in Microsoft Windows that allows IT admins to centrally manage and configure operating system settings, applications, and user settings across devices in an Active Directory environment.

If you experience an issue that's related to a feature update, check the Download Center for a related KIR policy template. If you don't find one, follow these steps to request a KIR activation for your organization.

1. Report the issue or regression to [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding), the customer-facing arm of Microsoft, and request the Group Policy to activate KIR.
1. Microsoft Support works with product teams to identify the applicable Group Policy settings, uploads an appropriate Group Policy template to the Download Center, and then provides you with the link to download the template.

Download the template, and then follow the steps in [How to use Group Policy to deploy a Known Issue Rollback](/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-deploy-known-issue-rollback).

For enterprise-managed devices that are domain-joined, the Group Policy refresh happens at certain regular intervals. To make sure that the Group Policy settings take effect, take one of the following actions:

- Wait for Group Policy to refresh in the background, then restart the affected devices.
- To force a single device to update its Group Policy settings, open a Command Prompt window on the device, and then run `gpupdate /force`. After the command runs, restart the device.

For more information about refreshing Group Policy, see [Group Policy processing for Windows](/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-policy/group-policy-processing).

Additionally, for information about how to mitigate regressions on Intune or endpoint management service managed devices, see [Use Group Policy to deploy a Known Issue Rollback](/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-deploy-known-issue-rollback).

### KIR for retail and consumer devices

Retail and consumer devices include non-enterprise devices, and all devices that get updates directly from the Windows Update cloud service (WU) by using **Settings** > **Windows Update** (WU). For these devices, Microsoft activates KIR by using Windows Update. Users don't have to take any action. In most cases, because of Microsoft's safe deployment practices, Microsoft identifies an issue in an update and publishes a KIR before most devices download and install the original update. In those cases, users never notice the original issue or the KIR.

> [!NOTE]  
> Any device that doesn't connect to Windows Update doesn't get Windows updates or KIR.

When Microsoft identifies a regression or other issue that affects retail and consumer devices, Microsoft product teams gather detailed information about the problem and its effects, determine the root cause of the issue, and report the issue internally. Then, based on the results of this analysis, Microsoft decides whether to roll back the change that caused the issue.

:::image type="content" source="media/known-issue-rollback/retail-kir-propagates-through-windows-update-service.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows how Microsoft distributes a K.I.R. by using the Windows Update infrastructure." lightbox="media/known-issue-rollback/retail-kir-propagates-through-windows-update-service.png":::

If Microsoft decides to roll back a change, it uses the Windows Update infrastructure to activate a KIR. First, Microsoft loads the KIR configuration change as an update. Windows Update notifies the affected devices of this update. Within 24 hours, the devices download and install the update. The devices might need to restart to finish the installation. After this process finishes, the code that caused the issue is disabled.

Microsoft transmits specific information regarding KIR activation. This data assists us in evaluating the effectiveness of the rollback within the ecosystem. See how to [configure Windows diagnostic data in your organization](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization).

## How to learn of and access KIR Group Policy templates

Occasionally, Microsoft has to activate KIR for an issue that affects multiple customers or represents a common customer scenario. In such a case, Microsoft documents this issue on Windows servicing communication channels. The documentation explains the most common symptoms of the issue. For enterprise and commercial customers, the documentation provides a link to the .msi file that contains the Group Policy template to use to activate KIR.

Here's where you can look for known issues and KIR mitigations:

- Windows release notes on the Windows update history sites, such as the [Windows 11](https://aka.ms/Windows11/24H2/UpdateHistory), [Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/windows-10-update-history-8127c2c6-6edf-4fdf-8b9f-0f7be1ef3562), and [Windows Server](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/windows-server-2025-update-history-10f58da7-e57b-4a9d-9c16-9f1dcd72d7d7) update history pages. Scroll down to the **Known issues in this update** section.
- [Windows release health](/windows/release-health/) dashboard. This site provides links to all Windows release notes for currently supported Windows versions.
- Windows release health section on the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/homepage). You can also sign up for [Windows release health notifications](/windows/deployment/update/check-release-health).

If you can't find documentation for the issue that you encounter, contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/onboarding).

## KIR lifecycle management: What to do once KIR is activated?

After enterprise and commercial customers deploy the Group Policy settings for a KIR, they don't have to take any other action. After Microsoft resolves the original issue, it includes the new code in subsequent Windows updates. The outdated Group Policy settings simply become benign settings that do nothing and aren't needed anymore.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### For a given issue, does the same Group Policy template apply for all affected devices?

No. The Group Policy settings that control KIR for a given issue often differ for different versions and editions of Windows. If you request a KIR Group Policy template from Microsoft Support, provide a comprehensive list of the affected operating system versions. Microsoft Support then provides a unique Group Policy template for each of the specified Windows versions. When you configure and deploy a template, pay attention to the Windows version that's listed in the template's file name.

### What do I do if I still see the issue after I deployed the KIR Group Policy template?

There are a few reasons you might still observe issues after you activate the KIR. In such cases, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you deploy the Group Policy template that corresponds to the device's Windows version.
1. Open Group Policy Editor, and then locate the appropriate Group Policy setting. Ensure that the state of the setting is **Disabled**.
1. If you changed a Group Policy setting, restart the devices that the policy applies to.
1. If the issue persists, contact your assigned Microsoft Support partner.

### What do I do if I need to activate KIR for my enterprise but can't use Group Policy infrastructure?

For more information about how to deploy KIR, including how to activate KIR for single devices and how to activate KIR without using Group Policy, see [Use Group Policy to deploy a Known Issue Rollback](/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-deploy-known-issue-rollback).
