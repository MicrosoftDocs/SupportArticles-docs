## Root cause

See exactly what is happening, we need to open and check the CBS.log (location C:\windows\logs\CBS) it looks similar to the following output:

Navigate to C:\windows\logs\CBS to open and check the CBS.log. You’ll be able to find out what’s causing the error. 

## CBS logs

```output
Info CBS Store corruption, manifest missing for package: Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4

Error CBS Failed to resolve package 'Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4' [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]

Info CBS Failed to resolve package [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]
```

The  issue can occure due to the following scenarios:

- This issue is occurring due to a missing or corrupted assembly from KB3192392, specifically: "Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4"
- This can also happen if the update was never installed and in some cases even if the installation happened, some packages were not applied to the registry.

To locate these packages in the system: Go the registry path:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Packages
 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This issue may vary depending on each case, but the baseline of the issue remains the same.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to collect the CBS.log or just logs using TSSv2, see, [CBS logs](https://aka.ms/dndlogs).

## Adding or removing the culprit KB manually

Add or remove the culprit KB manually from the OS. You’ll have to consider if the update has been installed before or not:  

### If KB was installed:

1. Reproduce the issue by trying to install the patch or the feature with issues. This ensures that the latest data is logged into the latest CBS.log.
1. Verify the KB after you have identified the package that the CBS process is complaining about.
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) and search for the KB number you have identified.
1. Select the KB and download it, depending on the OS version and architecture.
1. Paste the downloaded KB into a temporary folder in the C drive: C:\temp.
1. Run the following command in cmd as admin navigating to the folder. 

```output
cd \
cd temp
expand -F:* windows10.0-kb4462937-x64_9e250691ae6d00cdf677707e83435a612c3264ea.msu C:\temp
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is just an example of how you should name the file. In your case, use the name of downloaded file.

8. On expanding, you’ll see several packages coming from the main package.  Check the .cab file with the format "windows 10.0-KBxxxxxxx-x64.cab" (this file can vary depending on the OS version).
9. Run the below following command in cmd as admin:

```output
Dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\temp\windows10.0-kb4462937-x64.cab
```

> [!NOTE]
> We're using KB4462937 as an example. Remember to use the KB extracted into the c:\temp folder.

10. If you're asked to reboot, do it and then run the command in a cmd with administrator privileges. If the reboot  isn't required, just run the command in a cmd with administrator privileges:

```output
Dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\temp\windows10.0-kb4462937-x64.cab
```

11. Reboot the machine
12. Try again to install the update or feature

### If KB isn't installed:

1. Download the KB that we identified from [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx).
1. Paste the downloaded KB into a temporary folder in the C drive: C:\temp.
1. Run the following command in cmd as admin navigating to the folder..

```output
cd \
cd temp
expand -F:* windows10.0-kb4462937-x64_9e250691ae6d00cdf677707e83435a612c3264ea.msu C:\temp 
```

> [!NOTE]
> This is just an example of how you should name the file. In your case, use the name of downloaded file.

4. On expanding, you can see several packages that are coming from the main package.
5. Run the following command in cmd as admin:

```output
Dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\temp\windows10.0-kb4462937-x64.cab
```

> [!NOTE]
> We are using KB4462937 as an example. Remember to use the KB extracted into the c:\temp folder 

7. Reboot the machine

8. Try again to install the update or feature.

### IPU Process (In-place Upgrade)

> [!NOTE]
> Awareness: If the suggested fixes don’t resolve the issue, this specific Windows Update (WU) error code may require an In-Place Upgrade (IPU) to recover the virtual machine (VM). For Windows on Azure (WOA) scenarios, especially when trying to resolve issues quickly, these types of WU errors are reviewed and approved as eligible for IPU.
> This means that if customers face this error, you can confidently recommend an In-Place Upgrade as a simple and effective solution.
