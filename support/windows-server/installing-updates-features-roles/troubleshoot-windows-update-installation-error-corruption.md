# Troubleshoot Windows Update installation error 0x800f0831 CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION
Windows Update error 0x800f0831 (CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION) typically occurs if an update doesn't install the required package files correctly. This article helps you understand the root cause of the issue and the necessary steps to resolve it effectively.


## Prerequisites
Before you troubleshoot, follow the steps in [this article](https://supportability.visualstudio.com/AzureIaaSVM/_wiki/wikis/AzureIaaSVM/495352/Network-Level-Authentication_RDP-SSH?anchor=%3Cspan-class%3D%22mw-customtoggle-mydivision%22%3Ebackup-os-disk%3C/span%3E) to back up the OS disk.

## Symptoms

When you try to install any update by using the standalone installer (.msu), or you try to install a Windows update, you receive one of the following error messages:

> Some updates were not installed

:::image type="content" source="media/following-updates-were-not-installed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the installation error message.":::

> Updates failed

:::image type="content" source="media/windows-update-failed.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Windows Update failed error message.":::

## Cause

This error can occur for one of the following reasons:

- The update was never installed.
- The update is installed but some packages aren't applied to the registry.


To locate the installation packages in the system, search for the following registry subkey:

```output HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Packages```

To investigate the cause further, examine the CBS.log file (C:\windows\logs\CBS), and search for output that similar to the following example:

```output
Info CBS Store corruption, manifest missing for package: Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4

Error CBS Failed to resolve package 'Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4' [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]

Info CBS Mark store corruption flag because of package: Package_123_for_KB3192392~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.4. [HRESULT = 0x800f0831 - CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION]

## Resolution

If the update is installed, remove and reinstall it. If the update is not installed install it.


### Here are the steps to remove and install the update

1. Reproduce the issue by trying to install the update or feature that's experiencing issues. This action logs the latest data into the CBS log.
1. Verify that you have the correct update after you identify the package that the CBS process is calling out.
1. Navigate to [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx), and search for the KB number that you identified.
1. Select the appropriate KB version for the OS version and architecture, and then download the file to a temporary folder ("temp") on drive C.
1. Open an administrative Command Prompt window, and run the following command on the folder:

   ```output
   cd \
   cd temp
   expand -F:* windows10.0-kb4462937-x64_9e250691ae6d00cdf677707e83435a612c3264ea.msu C:\temp
   ```

   **Note:** In this command, substitute the actual name of the downloaded file.

1. In the expanded packages, locate the .cab file that uses the following format, depending on the OS version:

      windows 10.0-KB*xxxxxxx*-x64.cab
   
1. Run the following command at an administrative command prompt:

   ```output
   Dism /online /remove-package /packagepath:C:\temp\windows10.0-kb4462937-x64.cab
   ```

   **Note:** In this command, substitute the actual name of the .cab file.

### In-place upgrade process

> [!NOTE]
> If the suggested fixes donâ€™t resolve the issue, this specific Windows Update (WU) error code might require an in-place upgrade (IPU) as a simple and effective solution to recover the VM.
