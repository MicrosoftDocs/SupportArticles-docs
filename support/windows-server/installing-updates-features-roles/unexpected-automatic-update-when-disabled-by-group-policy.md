# Windows unexpectedly installs updates when automatic updates are disabled by Group Policy

Windows unexpectedly installs updates on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 automatically even though the **Configure Automatic Updates** Group Policy is set to one of the following options:

- Option 2 - **Notify before downloading and installing any updates**
- Option 3 - **Download the updates automatically and notify when they are ready to be installed**
- Option 5 - **Allow local administrators to select the configuration mode that Automatic Updates should notify and install updates** (this option hasn't been carried over to any Windows 10 versions)
- Option 7 - **Notify for install and notify for restart** (Windows Server only)

## Cause

This issue occurs when an administrator runs the command `GPUPDATE / FORCE`. This command resets all policy settings and reapplies them. During this interval, the automatic update settings are reverted to defaults, and updates might be installed. This issue occurs only on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019.

## Resolution

To avoid this issue, don't run `GPUPDATE /FORCE` on Windows Server 2016 and 2019 unless you're prepared for any queued updates to be installed. This issue is rare, but it can occur.

## Workarounds for Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019

For users on Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019, implementing one of the following workarounds can help reduce the frequency of the issue:

### Enable the "Configure registry policy processing" policy

1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Group Policy** > **Configure registry policy processing** and set it to **Enabled**.
2. Clear **Do not apply during periodic background processing**.
3. Select **Process even if the Group policy objects have not changed**.

### Enable the "Configure registry policy processing" policy by using the registry

Set the following registry keys:

`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy\{35378EAC-683F-11D2-A89A-00C04FBBCFA2}`  
`NoBackgroundPolicy`=dword:00000000  
`NoGPOListChanges`=dword:00000001

You can also run the following commands to modify the registry:

```console
reg add "HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy\{35378EAC-683F-11D2-A89A-00C04FBBCFA2}" /v NoBackgroundPolicy /t REG\_DWORD /d 00000000 /f
reg add "HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Group Policy\{35378EAC-683F-11D2-A89A-00C04FBBCFA2}" /v NoGPOListChanges /t REG\_DWORD /d 00000001 /f
```

> [!NOTE]
> These workarounds reduce the frequency of the problem but don't always prevent it from occurring.
