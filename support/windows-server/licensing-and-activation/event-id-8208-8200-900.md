>Log Name: Application

Date: *\<DateTime>*  
Event ID: 8208  
Task Category: None  
Level: Error  
Keywords: Classic  
User: N/A  
Computer: `Server1.contoso.com`  
Description:  
Acquisition of genuine ticket failed (hr=0x80072EE7) for template Id {99d92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f}  

> [!NOTE]
> The 0x80072EE7 error code indicates that the system did not have appropriate Internet access to be able to obtain the Windows Genuine Advantage ticket.

## Cause

These event IDs may be logged if an application or component in Windows tries to validate and call the Genuine Advantage APIs to acquire a Windows Genuine Advantage ticket if one does not exist. For example, these event IDs may be logged in the following situations:

- You opt in to the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). (Caller=wsqmcons.exe)
- You install the Desktop Experience feature, which then installs the Microsoft Store. (Caller=wshost.exe)

> [!NOTE]
> When you try to access the Microsoft Store, this triggers a request for a Windows Genuine Advantage ticket and an attempt to acquire one through validation.

## Resolution

The events that are mentioned in the "Symptoms" section are logged if the system does not have access to the Internet. To prevent these events from occurring, connect the system to the Internet, and then check the firewall and proxy settings.

If you cannot connect the system to the Internet, you can try the following methods to prevent Event ID 900, depending on the caller program identity:  

- If Caller=wsqmcons.exe, open Server Manager, and then clear the **Participating** check box to opt out of CEIP.
- If Caller=wshost.exe, disable the Microsoft Store application by enabling the Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Store\Turn off the Store application policy in either the local or domain Group Policy.

> [!NOTE]
> The inability to obtain a Windows Genuine Advantage ticket may not prevent the component from working. The presence of these event IDs does not mean that the computer is not genuine or that a licensing issue exists.

## More information

The Genuine Advantage feature is designed for client operating systems and is typically not found on a server. However, it is possible for a Windows component to use the Windows Genuine Advantage APIs if it has to.
