## Cause

This problem can occur when you attempt to access a share that is located on a computer in a domain (either parent or child) from another domain, or when you attempt to gain access to a share that is located in the same domain.

This problem occurs most commonly when a Windows computer that has been a member of one domain is moved to another domain. The computer account for the computer that has been moved displays a red "X". For this problem to occur in a single-domain environment, the computer account had to have been set to disabled.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, delete the disabled computer account in Active Directory Users and Computers.

## Status

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are listed at the beginning of this article.

## More information

The resolution in this article has also been documented to resolve the problem that causes the following error message:  
> Access is denied; account is currently disabled.
