# You can't connect to the Internet after you connect to a VPN server

This article fixes an issue that you can't connect to the Internet after you log on to a server that's running Routing and Remote Access by using VPN.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 317025

## Symptoms

After you use a VPN connection to log on to a server that is running Routing and Remote Access, you may be unable to connect to the Internet.

## Cause

This issue may occur if you configure the VPN connection to use the default gateway on the remote network. This setting overrides the default gateway settings that you specify in the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) settings.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, configure the client computers to use the default gateway setting on the local network for Internet traffic and a static route on the remote network for VPN-based traffic.

> [!NOTE]
> Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

### Step 1: Configure the server that's running Routing and Remote Access to use a static IP address pool

- Windows 2000 Server

    1. Select **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and then select **Routing and Remote Access**.
    2. Right-click the server that is running Routing and Remote Access, and then select **Properties**.
    3. Select the **IP** tab, select **Static address pool**, and then select **Add**.
    4. Type the start of the Internet Protocol (IP) address range in the **Start IP address** box, type the end of the IP address range in the **End IP address** box, and then select **OK**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Configure a pool of static IP addresses on a different network segment than the network segment on which the internal local area network (LAN) exists.

    5. Select the **Enable IP routing** check box if it isn't already selected.
    6. Select **OK**.
    7. Enable TCP/IP forwarding.

- Windows NT Server 4.0

    1. Select **Start**, point to **Settings**, select **Control Panel**, and then double-click **Network**.
    2. Select the **Services** tab, select **Remote Access Service** in the **Network Services** list, and then select **Properties**.
    3. Select **Network**, select the TCP/IP check box if it isn't already selected. And then select **Configure** next to TCP/IP.
    4. Select **Use static address pool**.
    5. Type the start of the IP address range in the **Begin** box, type the end of the IP address range in the **End** box.

        > [!NOTE]
        > Configure a pool of static IP addresses on a different network segment than the network segment on which the internal LAN exists.
    6. To exclude a range of IP addresses from the static address pool, type the starting IP address of the range that you want to exclude in the **From** box, type the ending IP address of the range that you want to exclude in the **To** box, and then select **Add**.
    7. Select **OK**, select **OK**, and then select **Continue**.
    8. Select the **Protocols** tab, select **TCP/IP Protocol** > **Properties**. Select the **Routing** tab, and then select the **Enable IP Forwarding** check box if it isn't already selected.
    9. Select **OK**, and then select **Close**.
    10. Select **Yes** to restart the computer.

### Step 2: Configure the VPN client TCP/IP properties

To disable the **Use Default Gateway on Remote Network** setting in the VPN dial-up connection item on the client computer:

1. Double-click **My Computer**, and then select the **Network and Dial-up Connections** link.
2. Right-click the VPN connection that you want to change, and then select **Properties**.
3. Select the **Networking** tab, select **Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)** in the **Components checked are used by this connection** list, and then select **Properties**.
4. Select **Advanced**, and then clear the **Use default gateway on remote network** check box.
5. Select **OK**, select **OK**, and then select **OK**.

### Step 3: Connect to the server that's running Routing and Remote Access

On the client computer, connect to the Internet, and then establish a VPN connection to the server that is running Routing and Remote Access.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot connect to resources on the remote network because you have disabled the **Use Default Gateway on Remote Network** setting in the VPN TCP/IP configuration.

### Step 4: Add a static route on the client

Add a static route on the client computer that uses the following configuration:

- The remote network is the destination.
- The correct subnet mask is used for the remote network.
- The first IP address from the static IP address pool that you configured in the [Step 1: Configure the server that's running Routing and Remote Access to use a static IP address pool](#step-1-configure-the-server-thats-running-routing-and-remote-access-to-use-a-static-ip-address-pool) section of this article is the gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> The Routing and Remote Access server assigns this first IP address to its wide area network (WAN) Miniport driver.

For example, to add a static route to a network that has the IP address of 192.168.10.0, the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and the gateway (the first IP address of the range assigned to the static IP address pool) of 192.168.1.1, run the following command:

```console
route -p add 192.168.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use the -p switch with Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0, the route is made *persistent*. Use this switch to ensure that the routing entry is preserved when the computer is restarted.

> [!NOTE]
> The `-p` switch isn't supported on either Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition-based, Microsoft Windows 98-based, or Microsoft Windows 95-based computers.

## Workaround

To work around this issue, create a batch file that contains the necessary route add command. And then configure it to run each time that a client connects to the VPN Server.
