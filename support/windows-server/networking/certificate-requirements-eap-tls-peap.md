# Certificate requirements when you use EAP-TLS or PEAP with EAP-TLS

When you use Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) or Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) with EAP-TLS, your client and server certificates must meet certain requirements.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 11, Windows 10  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 814394

## Summary

When you use EAP with a strong EAP type, such as TLS with smart cards, or TLS with certificates, both the client and the server use certificates to verify identities to each other. Certificates must meet specific requirements both on the server and the client for successful authentication.

The certificate must be configured with one or more purposes in Extended Key Usage (EKU) extensions that match the certificate use. For example, a certificate that's used for the authentication of a client to a server must be configured with the **Client Authentication** purpose. Or, a certificate that's used for the authentication of a server must be configured with the **Server Authentication** purpose. When certificates are used for authentication, the authenticator examines the client certificate and looks for the correct purpose object identifier (OID) in EKU extensions. For example, the OID for the **Client Authentication** purpose is `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2`, and the OID for **Server Authentication** is `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1`.

## Minimum certificate requirements

All certificates that are used for network access authentication must meet the requirements for X.509 certificates. They must also meet the requirements for connections that use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption and Transport Level Security (TLS) encryption. After these minimum requirements are met, both the client certificates and the server certificates must meet the following extra requirements.

## Client certificate requirements

With either EAP-TLS or PEAP with EAP-TLS, the server accepts the client's authentication when the certificate meets the following requirements:

- The client certificate is issued by an enterprise certification authority (CA). Or it maps to a user account or a computer account in the Active Directory directory service.

- The user or the computer certificate on the client chains to a trusted root CA.
- The user or the computer certificate on the client includes the **Client Authentication** purpose.
- The user or the computer certificate doesn't fail any one of the checks that are performed by the CryptoAPI certificate store. And the certificate passes requirements in the remote access policy.
- The user or the computer certificate doesn't fail any one of the certificate OID checks that are specified in the Network Policy Server (NPS) remote access policy.
- The 802.1X client doesn't use registry-based certificates that are either smart-card certificates or certificates that are protected with a password.
- The Subject Alternative Name (SubjectAltName) extension in the certificate contains the user principal name (UPN) of the user.
- When clients use EAP-TLS or PEAP with EAP-TLS authentication, a list of all the installed certificates is displayed in the Certificates snap-in, with the following exceptions:
  - Wireless clients don't display registry-based certificates and smart card logon certificates.
  - Wireless clients and virtual private network (VPN) clients don't display certificates that are protected with a password.
  - Certificates that don't contain the **Client Authentication** purpose in EKU extensions aren't displayed.

## Server certificate requirements

You can configure clients to validate server certificates by using the **Validate server certificate** option. This option is on the **Authentication** tab in the Network Connection properties. When a client uses PEAP-EAP-MS-Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) version 2 authentication, PEAP with EAP-TLS authentication, or EAP-TLS authentication, the client accepts the server's certificate when the certificate meets the following requirements:

- The computer certificate on the server chains to one of the following CAs:

  - A trusted Microsoft root CA.
  
  - A Microsoft stand-alone root or third-party root CA in an Active Directory domain that has an NTAuthCertificates store that contains the published root certificate. For more information about how to import third-party CA certificates, see [How to import third-party certification authority (CA) certificates into the Enterprise NTAuth store](https://support.microsoft.com/help/295663).

- The NPS or the VPN server computer certificate is configured with the **Server Authentication** purpose. The OID for **Server Authentication** is `1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1`.

- The computer certificate doesn't fail any one of the checks that are performed by the CryptoAPI certificate store. And it doesn't fail any one of the requirements in the remote access policy.

- The name in the Subject line of the server certificate matches the name that's configured on the client for the connection.

- For wireless clients, the Subject Alternative Name (SubjectAltName) extension contains the server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

- If the client is configured to trust a server certificate with a specific name, the user is prompted to decide about trusting a certificate with a different name. If the user rejects the certificate, authentication fails. If the user accepts the certificate, the certificate is added to the local computer trusted root certificate store.

> [!NOTE]
> With PEAP or with EAP-TLS authentication, servers display a list of all the installed certificates in the Certificates snap-in. However, the certificates that contain the **Server Authentication** purpose in EKU extensions are not displayed.
