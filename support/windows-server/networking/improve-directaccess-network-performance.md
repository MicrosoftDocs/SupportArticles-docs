# DirectAccess network performance in Windows

This article discusses a performance issue that affects DirectAccess networking.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10, version 1809, Windows 10, version 1709, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4056838

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You use DirectAccess with IP-HTTPS or TEREDO to connect to the corporate network.  
- You access and download some files from a corporate network share.  

In this scenario, DirectAccess works correctly. However, you expect better network performance.  

## Workaround

Network performance can be improved by switching to a "Microsoft Always On" virtual private network (VPN).

For a complete feature comparison, see [Always On VPN and DirectAccess Features Comparison](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/vpn/vpn-map-da).
