# Remediating MCA issues, part 1: Identify computers that have MCA issues

This article discusses how to collect and analyze data to determine whether you have an issue that you can remediate by using the `MaxConcurrentApi` registry entry. This kind of issue is also known as an MCA issue. This process helps you determine which computers in your infrastructure are affected by this issue.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 and later versions, Windows 8 and later versions

## Summary

Technically, `MaxConcurrentApi` defines the number of *lsass.exe* threads per secure channel that are available to the Netlogon service. This value is set in the registry of each server. You shouldn't change it unless you have done the following:

- Identified specific servers that show evidence of an MCA issue
- Calculated a specific `MaxConcurrentApi` value for each affected server

If you change the value without following these rules, you might not fix the issue. In fact, you could cause other problems.

This article describes how to identify the servers that you should modify by using the following process:

1. Identify the data that you have to collect.
1. Identify the computers on which you have to collect data
1. Determine whether your infrastructure has an MCA issue.
1. Identify specific servers that can benefit from a tuned `MaxConcurrentApi` value.

## Useful data types

> [!NOTE]  
> This list of data and data sources is not exhaustive. Other data types and data sources, such as [event tracing for windows (ETW)](/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-) and the NTLM Operational event log, are beyond the scope of this article.

### How to start and stop network traces

You can use the Windows native [Network shell (netsh)](/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh) tool to collect network traces. To start tracing, open a Command Prompt window on the affected server, and then enter the following command:

```console
netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=c:\temp\<Filename>.etl
```

> [!NOTE]  
> In this command, \<*Filename*> represents the name of the file that stores the trace data.

To stop tracing, sign in to the server by using the same account that you used when you started tracing. At the command prompt, enter the following command:

  ```console
  netsh trace stop
```

After tracing stops, netsh generates ETL and CAB files in the location that you provided. You can use [Network Monitor](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=4865) or Message Analyzer (deprecated, no longer available for download) to review the files.

### More information about Netlogon performance counters

The **Netlogon** performance counters provide most precise data for tuning the `MaxConcurrentApi` value.

> [!NOTE]  
>
> - The **Security System-Wide Statistics** object in Performance Monitor provides several authentication-related counters. However, they do not provide data that you can apply directly to `MaxConcurrentApi`.
> - Other performance counters, such as CPU and network counters, don't reflect performance information that's relevant to `MaxConcurrentApi`.

The following table describes the most relevant counters. (In Performance Monitor, these counters belong to the **Netlogon** object.) The "Grocery store scenario" is a more relatable version of the technical explanation.

| Performance counter | Technical explanation | Grocery store scenario |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Semaphore Holders** | The number of threads that are holding the semaphore. This number can be any value up to the currently configured value of MaxConcurrentApi. | The number of people who are currently checking out at the cash registers. |
| **Semaphore Waiters** | The number of threads that are waiting to obtain the semaphore. | The number of people who are waiting in line to check out. |
| **Semaphore Timeouts** | The total number of times that a thread has timed out while waiting for the semaphore, measured over the lifetime of the secure channel (or since system startup). | The total number of people who abandon the check-out line because they ran out of time. (If the line were quicker, or there were additional lines, this might not occur.) |
| **Average Semaphore Hold Time** | The average time (measured in seconds) that the semaphore is held over the last sample. | The average time that it takes each person to get through the line and check out. |
| **Semaphore Acquires** | The total number of times that the semaphore is obtained over the lifetime of the secure channel (or since system startup). | The total number of people who successfully check out. |

### More information about events

The following table lists the events that are associated with MCA issues. You can find these events by using Event Viewer or the Netlogon log files to get a quick indication of whether a computer might have an MCA issue.

| Event source and ID | Event description | Related performance counters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Netlogon 5816 | Netlogon has failed an authentication request of account \<*username*> in domain \<*user domain FQDN*>. The request timed out before it could be sent to domain controller \<*directly trusted domain controller FQDN*> in domain \<*directly trusted domain name*>. This is the first failure. If the problem continues, consolidated events will be logged about every \<*event log frequency in minutes*> minutes. | **Semaphore Timeouts** has a nonzero value.<br/>Authentication requests are failing. |
| Netlogon 5817 | Netlogon has failed an additional \<*count*> authentication requests in the last \<*event log frequency in minutes*> minutes. The requests timed out before they could be sent to domain controller \<*directly trusted domain controller FQDN*> in domain \<*directly trusted domain name*>. | **Semaphore Timeouts** has a nonzero value.<br/>Authentication requests are failing. |
| Netlogon 5818 | Netlogon took more than \<*warning event threshold*> seconds for an authentication request of account \<*username*> in domain \<*user domain FQDN*>, through domain controller \<*directly trusted domain controller FQDN*> in domain \<*directly trusted domain name*>. This is the first warning. If the problem persists, a recurring event will be logged every \<*event log frequency in minutes*> minutes. | **Semaphore Waiters** has a nonzero value.<br/>Authentication requests are slowing down. |
| Netlogon 5819 | Netlogon took more than \<*warning event threshold*> seconds for \<*count*> authentication requests through domain controller \<*directly trusted domain controller FQDN*> in domain \<*directly trusted domain name*> in the last \<*event log frequency in minutes*> minutes. | **Semaphore Waiters** has a nonzero value.<br/>Authentication requests are slowing down. |

> [!NOTE]  
> Kerberos Event ID 7 might indicate an MCA issue. The event has the following description:  
>
> The Kerberos subsystem encountered a PAC verification failure. This indicates that the PAC from the client in realm had a PAC which did not verify or was modified. Contact your system administrator.
>
> However, situations other than an MCA issue can also trigger this event.

For information about how to modify the logging frequency and warning threshold of event IDs 5816â€“5819, see [New event log entries that track NTLM authentication delays and failures in Windows Server 2008 R2 are available](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/new-event-log-entries-that-track-ntlm-authentication-delays-and-failures-in-windows-server-2008-r2-are-available-f72c93de-cabd-f23f-c0ac-e4d6643163d4).

### More information about Netlogon logs and error messages

When Netlogon logging is enabled on a server, The Netlogon service generates Netlogon.log and Netlogon.bak files. For more information, see [Enabling debug logging for the Netlogon service](../../windows-client/windows-security/enable-debug-logging-netlogon-service.md). You can use the error messages and events to identify MCA issues when they occur, to identify which domain controllers are responding to authentication requests, and to help identify trends in issue timing.

You can use a text editor to review the log files. If Netlogon.bak files are available, review those files in addition to the Netlogon.log files. When an authentication request times out because of an MCA issue, you see a pattern of log entries that resembles the following excerpt:

```output  
06/03 14:16:58 [LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of <Domain>\User1 from WORKSTATION1 Entered  
06/03 14:17:43 [CRITICAL] <Domain>: NlAllocateClientApi timed out: 0 258  
06/03 14:17:43 [CRITICAL] <Domain>: NlpUserValidateHigher: Can't allocate Client API slot.  
06/03 14:17:43 [LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of <Domain>\User1 from WORKSTATION1 Returns 0xC000005E  
```

The first line of the excerpt records the authentication request. The second line is generated 45 seconds later and documents the time-out.

> [!NOTE]  
> In a typical log file, there may be hundreds of unrelated log entries between these two lines.  

Two error messages follow the time-out line:

- **Can't allocate Client API slot.** This message is diagnostic of an MCA issue.
- **Network logon...Returns 0xC000005E.** This message always accompanies the previous message. However, other issues can also generate this message, so it's not considered to be diagnostic by itself.

When an MCA issue occurs, the Netlogon log might also record Netlogon events (event ID 5816-5819).

Log entries that resemble the following example can help you trace the paths that authentication requests are taking through your systems:

```output
12/25 01:39:03 [PERF] NlSetServerClientSession: Not changing connection (000000000A10FA48): "\\DC01.FAKEDOMAIN.LOCAL"
```

## Where to start looking for the issue

Similar to any bottleneck, your environment&mdash;particularly your domain topology and your network infrastructure&mdash;affects how an MCA issue manifests itself. An issue that occurs on one server might induce related issues on other servers. The most likely servers to have MCA issues are the domain controllers and the application servers (front-end or back-end servers). MCA issues are rare on workstations.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you know of a user and workstation that consistenly has authentication problems, you can also review verbose Netlogon logs from the workstation. These logs might provide insight into the issue. However, they are unlikely to reveal the root cause of the issue.

### Identify your potential authentication paths and chokepoints

An *authentication path* is the path from one server to the next that a Netlogon-based authentication request follows. For the purposes of this discussion, the application server receives the request first. The request travels to a domain controller that completes the authentication and returns the response to the application server. However, this is the highly simplified view. The details of the process depend on your infrastructure and your domain topology, among other factors. This process is important because, to identify an MCA issue, you have to analyze data from every application server and domain controller that might handle an authentication request.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Any of the servers that are on the authentication path might create a chokepoint where an MCA issue can slow down authentication requests. Additionally, more than one server might have an MCA issue at the same time.

When the application server has to authenticate a user, the application server first tries to contact a nearby domain controller (that is, within the same Active Directory logical site). If there isn't a domain controller within the same site, the application server sends the authentication request to any domain controller that's available in the local domain. If the user isn't a member of the domain, the domain controller has to pass the request on. The system uses several criteria for determining where the request goes next:

- If the domain has a shortcut trust or external trust that connects to another domain, the next domain controller in the path belongs to the domain that the trust dictates.  
- If the domain isn't the forest root domain, the next domain controller belongs to the forest root domain.
- If the user isn't a member of the forest root domain, that domain controller determines whether the user belongs to another domain in the same forest.
- If the user belongs to another domain in the forest, the next domain controller belongs to the user's domain.
- If the user doesn't belong to the forest, the request goes next to the root domain of any trusted forest.
- If the user's domain is in a trusted forest, a domain controller in that forest's root domain sends the request to a domain controller in the user's domain.

When the final domain controller in the path authenticates the user, it returns the authentication response to the application server. The response follows the same path as the request, but in reverse.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you use Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)-integrated DNS, the AD DS site topology can simplify or complicate the authentication path. The DNS records for the domain controllers contain site information. Therefore, when a domain controller queries DNS to find a domain controller in a target domain, it might actually send two DNS queries, as follows:  
>
> - The first query requests a list of domain controllers that belong to the same AD DS site in the target domain.
> - If the first request fails, the domain controller queries again to get a list of all of the domain controllers that are in the target domain.
>
> In either case, any of the domain controllers in the list might receive the authentication request. The selection algorithm doesn't account for other factors, such as connection speed. In complex topologies, sites can constrain possible authentication paths to selected subsets of domain controllers that have high-capacity connections.

The following diagram provides a very high-level overview of the criteria that determine an authentication path.

### Examples of how to identify authentication paths and potential chokepoints

The following examples illustrate how to identify the servers that you should check for MCA issues.

#### Example 1: Single-forest topology

Consider the following topology.

:::image type="content" source="./media/maxconcurrentapi-1-identify-computers-that-have-mca-issues/single-forest-three-domain-auth-path.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows how authentication requests travel from child domains to the root domain in a single-forest topology." border="false":::

The web server in Domain B services users from Domain C and uses NTLM authentication. Both Domain B and Domain C are in the same forest. Domain A is the forest root domain.

Every time that a user accesses a web server resource, an authentication request follows these steps:

1. The web server receives the authentication request and then sends it to a "nearby" domain controller (a domain controller in the same logical site in the web server's domain).  

   If there isn't a domain controller in the same site, the web server resends the request to any domain controller in Domain B.

2. The Domain B domain controller determines that the user isn't in Domain B and passes the authentication request up to the forest root (Domain A).  

   Again, the Domain B domain controller first tries to send the request to a domain controller in the same site, and if that doesn't work, it sends the request to any available domain controller in Domain A.

3. The Domain A domain controller determines that the user doesn't belong to Domain A, but does belong to Domain C in the same forest. It sends the request to Domain C (either a same-site domain controller, or any domain controller in the domain).

4. The Domain C domain controller authenticates the user and then sends the authentication response.

5. To complete the authentication process, the response travels back along the same chain to the web server in Domain B.

Depending on the site topology, the following servers are the potential chokepoints.

| Path segment | Sending and receiving servers within one site | Sending and receiving servers in different sites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web server<br/>Domain B domain controllers within the site | Web server<br/>All Domain B domain controllers |
| 2 | Domain A domain controllers within the site | All Domain A domain controllers |
| 3 | Domain C domain controllers within the site | All Domain C domain controllers |

#### Example 2: Simple two-forest topology

Consider the following topology:

:::image type="content" source="./media/maxconcurrentapi-1-identify-computers-that-have-mca-issues/two-forest-six-domain-auth-path.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows how authentication requests travel from child domains to the root domain in a two-forest topology." border="false":::

Domain A is the root domain of forest A, and Domain D is the root domain of forest B. Domains A and B have a forest trust.

Domains B and C belong to forest A, and Domains E and F belong to forest B. A web server in Domain B uses NTLM authentication to service users in Domain E.

The web server in Domain B services users from Domain E and uses NTLM authentication. Domain B is a child domain of Domain A (forest root), with Domain A holding a forest trust with Domain D, which contains Domain E (the child domain holding the user accounts).

Each time a user accesses a web server resource, an authentication request follows these steps:

1. The web server receives the authentication request and then sends it to a "nearby" domain controller (a domain controller in the same logical site in the web server's domain).  

   If there isn't a domain controller in the same site, the web server resends the request to any domain controller in Domain B.

2. The Domain B domain controller determines that the user isn't in Domain B. It passes the authentication request up to the forest root (Domain A).  

   Again, the Domain B domain controller first tries to send the request to a domain controller in the same site. If that doesn't work, Domain B domain controller sends the request to any available domain controller in Domain A.

3. The Domain A domain controller determines that the user doesn't belong to Domain A, and that the user's domain isn't in forest A. It forwards the authentication request across the forest trust to Domain D (either a same-site domain controller or any domain controller in the domain).

4. The Domain D domain controller determines that the user doesn't belong to Domain D, but does belong to Domain E in the same forest. It sends the request to Domain E (either a same-site domain controller, or any domain controller in the domain).

5. The Domain E domain controller authenticates the user and then sends the authentication response.

6. To complete the authentication process, the response travels back along the same chain to the web server in Domain B.

Depending on the site topology, the following servers are the potential chokepoints:

| Path segment | Sending and receiving servers within one site | Sending and receiving servers in different sites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web server<br/>Domain B domain controllers within the site | Web server<br/>All Domain B domain controllers |
| 2 | Domain A domain controllers within the site | All Domain A domain controllers |
| 3 | Domain D domain controllers within the site | All Domain D domain controllers |
| 4 | Domain E domain controllers within the site | All Domain E domain controllers |

### Example 3: Internal/external forest topology

Consider the following topology.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/maxconcurrentapi-1-identify-computers-that-have-mca-issues/two-domain-external-trust-auth-path.svg" alt-text="Diagram that shows how authentication requests travel between two domains that have an external trust relationship." border="false":::  

Domain A and Domain D have an external trust. The web server in Domain A services users from Domain D and uses NTLM authentication.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is the same method that applies to shortcut trusts.

Every time that a user accesses a web server resource, an authentication request follows these steps:

1. The web server receives the authentication request and then sends it to a "nearby" domain controller (a domain controller in the same logical site in the web server's domain). If there isn't a domain controller in the same site, the web server resends the request to any domain controller in Domain A.

2. The Domain A domain controller determines that the user doesn't belong to Domain A. It forwards the authentication request across the external trust to Domain D (either a same-site domain controller or any domain controller in the domain).

3. The Domain D domain controller authenticates the user and then sends the authentication response.

4. To complete the authentication process, the response travels back along the same chain to the web server in Domain A.

Depending on the site topology, the following servers are the potential chokepoints.

| Path segment | Sending and receiving servers within one site | Sending and receiving servers in different sites |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web server<br/>Domain A domain controllers within the site | Web server<br/>All Domain A domain controllers |
| 2 | Domain E domain controllers within the site | All Domain E domain controllers |

### Quick reference: Potential chokepoints in different scenarios

This table covers possible chokepoints in a more generalized scope as search guidelines. When reviewing the table, keep in mind that in front-end/back-end configurations, both the front-end and back-end application servers are potential chokepoints. Similarly, you have to collect data on all members of load-balanced groups of servers.

#### Single forest scenarios

| Example bottleneck scenarios | Possible chokepoints (where to collect data) |

## Preliminary investigation: Is there an MCA issue?

After you've identified the potential chokepoints in your infrastructure, you can start collecting and analyzing data. The first priority is to identify whether an MCA issue actually exists. Later, you narrow down exactly which server (or servers) has an issue. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To collect data, enable Netlogon logging for all the chokepoints that you identified in the previous section. If you have many potential chokepoints, review both this section and the next section, [Narrow your scope and identify trends](#narrow-your-scope-and-identify-trends).

To identify an MCA issue, you have to collect performance data while the servers are under a heavy load. A heavy load occurs when the servers see the most client requests. For example, in an email server scenario, the best time to collect the performance data is when users arrive at work and check their email messages. Therefore, you must make sure that all servers in a given scenario have their performance data reviewed while they're busy servicing heavy loads.

### Quick scan: Performance counters and event logs

The Netlogon performance counters and event logs provide an at-a-glance view of whether an issue exists. You might also be able to identify whether the problem is on the server that provided the data or another server that's within the same site or domain.

To help interpret the counter values, check whether the server that provided the data already has a nondefault `MaxConcurrentApi` value. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select **Start**, enter *regedit*, and then select **Registry Editor** in the search results.
1. Go to the following registry subkey:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters\MaxConcurrentApi`
1. If the `MaxConcurrentApi` key doesn't exist, you can safely assume that the computer uses the default value for `MaxConcurrentApi`. The default values are as follows:

   - Domain controllers and member servers (Windows Server 2012 and later versions): **10**
   - Client computers and workstations (Windows 8 and later versions): **1**

> [!NOTE]  
> Client computers and workstations rarely use a value that's greater than **1**.

The following table lists events and counter values that you might see together on a single computer, and the significance of each combination.

| Events | Counter values | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| N/A | **Semaphore Holders** is equal to the currently configured MCA setting on the local server. | The local server (or another server at the same level of the authentication chain) might have an MCA issue. |
|5816<br/>5817 | **Semaphore Timeouts** has a non-zero value | Authentication time-outs are occurring. The local server might have an MCA issue. |
| 5818<br/>5819 | **Semaphore Waiters** has a nonzero value that continues for any length of time<br/>&ndash;and&ndash;<br/> **Semaphore Holders** has a value that's less than the MCA setting on the local server | An MCA issue might exist on a different server in the authentication chain. |

### Quick scan: Netlogon log files

To use the Netlogon log files to identify an MCA issue, search the files for `Can't allocate client API slot`. You can do this by using a text editor such as Notepad, a script, or command-line commands. Use a non case-sensitive search. If this string appears in the log file, you have an MCA issue.

For example, if you stored *netlogon.log* and *netlogon.bak* in the *c:\temp* folder, you can open a Command Prompt window and run the following commands:

```console
Find /I "Can't allocate client API slot" c:\temp\netlogon.log > c:\temp\MCA-detect-sample.txt
Find /I "Can't allocate client API slot" c:\temp\netlogon.bak >> c:\temp\MCA-detect-sample.txt
```

If the log files do contain the string, the results file, *MCA-detect-sample.txt*, contains text that resembles the following excerpt:

```output
---------- C:\temp\NETLOGON.LOG

```

> [!NOTE]  
> In this excerpt, \<*Domain*> represents the domain that responded to the authentication request.  

If you don't find any matches on a particular server, search the files for *0xC000005E*. This error code indicates that an authentication request timed out. It might also indicate that one of the other computers that handled the authentication request has an MCA error. Use this information to determine which computers to examine next. If you're dealing with a large number of servers, see the next section for help to narrow the scope of your analysis.

## Narrow your scope and identify trends

This section provides tips to help you deal with many potential chokepoints.

To use `MaxConcurrentApi` effectively, you have to pinpoint specific servers to mitigate. In the longer term, you have to understand why these specific servers were overloaded. Using that information, you can improve your topology so that it no longer needs `MaxConcurrentApi` adjustments (described in [Part 3](maxconcurrentapi-3-troubleshoot-causes-of-mca-issues.md) of this series).

> [!NOTE]  
> You can use applications such as Notepad or Microsoft Excel to sort and search through log files.

Look for trends such as the following:

- Netlogon logs include connection messages that you can use to identify which domain controllers are involved in an authentication path. Such log entries resemble the following excerpt:  

   ```output
   12/25 01:39:03 [PERF] NlSetServerClientSession: Not changing connection (000000000A10FA48): "\\DC01.CONTOSO.LOCAL"
   ```

- When you identify which domain controllers a server tries to connect to, check that the request actually arrived at one of them.

  For example, suppose that you find `Can't allocate client API slot` errors in your application server logs. Such errors indicate that the application server itself has an MCA issue. Double-check any domain controllers that the application server tried to contact. If the application server is the root of the issue, it's likely that the domain controllers never received the request.

- Use the timestamps in Netlogon logs and network traces (and potentially performance counters) to compare the speed of each "hop" in the authentication path.  

  For example, consider an authentication request that has to travel between two child domains in a single forest. The time that's required to pass the request from the requesting child domain to the root domain is significantly shorter than the time that's required to pass from the root domain to the destination child domain. In this case, something might be delaying the request on the root domain controller or the destination (child) domain controller.

- Check which users are affected, and when they are affected. Are all the affected users from the same domain or forest? Does the issue affect only specific users or all users? Does the time of day make a difference? You can use Netlogon log entries that resemble the following excerpts to track requests for specific users:

  ```output
  [8]12/25 07:12:02 [LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of CONTOSO\User1 from WIN7CLIENT1 Returns 0xC000005E
  ```

  ```output
  [3905][29654]12/25 07:16:03 [LOGON] SamLogon: Network logon of CONTOSO\User1 from WIN7CLIENT1 Returns 0xC000005E
  ```

## Example: Use Performance Monitor to search for an MCA issue

As a real-world example, consider a Performance Monitor data (BLG) file from an application server that runs IIS and FTP and also provides file and print server functionality. The data file starts a few hours after the issue appears. For this example, assume that the server that produced this data is the only one that's in the environment that's suspected to have an MCA issue.

The following view in Performance Manager shows a 110-second segment of the data.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/maxconcurrentapi-1-identify-computers-that-have-mca-issues/perfmon-min-max-semaphore-timeouts.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a two-minute interval of semaphore time-out data in Performance Monitor.":::  

### Are authentication requests timing out?

First, use the data for the **Semaphore Timeouts** counter to calculate the number of semaphore time-outs that occur during this interval. This counter is cumulative. Therefore, the value at the beginning of the duration is the minimum, and the value at the end of the duration is the maximum. Subtracting the minimum number of time-outs from the maximum number of time-outs produces a value of 2,253 time-outs during this interval. The expected value for this counter is zero. Clearly, an MCA issue exists here.

### What's the volume of delayed requests?

Look at the data for the **Semaphore Waiters** counter during the same interval. This counter tracks the requests that are waiting but haven't yet timed out. This information can indicate the magnitude of the issue.  

:::image type="content" source="./media/maxconcurrentapi-1-identify-computers-that-have-mca-issues/perfmon-avg-max-semaphore-waiters.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows a two-minute interval of semaphore waiters data in Performance Monitor.":::  

In this case, up to 2,157 "waiters" exist during this interval.

### Conclusion

Our example server has a significant authentication time-out problem. We'll continue this example in part 2 of this series to show how to calculate a `MaxConcurrentApi` value for this server.
