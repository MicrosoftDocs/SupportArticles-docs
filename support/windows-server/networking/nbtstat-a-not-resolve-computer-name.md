# NBTSTAT -A command does not resolve computer name with DNS

This article provides a workaround for an issue where the `NBTSTAT -A` command doesn't resolve computer name with Domain Name System (DNS).

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 249874

## Symptoms

When you use the `nbtstat -a` command with a remote computer and the name of the computer is resolved by DNS, you receive a **Host not found** error message.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, ping the name of the computer, and then use the IP address that is returned with the `nbtstat -a` command.
