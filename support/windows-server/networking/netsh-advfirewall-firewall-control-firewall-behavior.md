# Use netsh advfirewall firewall instead of netsh firewall to control Windows Firewall behavior

This article describes how to use the `netsh advfirewall` firewall context instead of the `netsh firewall` context to control Windows Firewall behavior.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 947709

## Summary

The `netsh advfirewall` firewall command-line context is available in Windows Server 2012 R2. This context provides the functionality for controlling Windows Firewall behavior that was provided by the `netsh firewall` firewall context.

This context also provides functionality for more precise control of firewall rules. These rules include the following per-profile settings:

- Domain
- Private
- Public

The `netsh firewall` command-line context might be deprecated in a future version of the Windows operating system. We recommend that you use the `netsh advfirewall` firewall context to control firewall behavior.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are a member of the Administrators group, and User Account Control is enabled on your computer, run the commands from a command prompt with elevated permissions. To start a command prompt with elevated permissions, find the icon or Start menu entry that you use to start a command prompt session, right-click it, and then click **Run as administrator**.

Some examples of frequently used commands are provided in the following tables. You can use these examples to help you migrate from the older `netsh firewall` context to the new `netsh advfirewall` firewall context.

Additionally, the `netsh advfirewall` commands that you can use to obtain detailed inline help are provided.

## Command example 1: Enable a program

| `netsh firewall add allowedprogram program=C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe name="My Application" mode=ENABLE scope=CUSTOM addresses=157.60.0.1,172.16.0.0/16,LocalSubnet profile=Domain`| `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="My Application" dir=in action=allow program= "C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe" enable=yes remoteip=157.60.0.1,172.16.0.0/16,LocalSubnet profile=domain` |
|`netsh firewall add allowedprogram program=C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe name="My Application" mode=ENABLE scope=CUSTOM addresses=157.60.0.1,172.16.0.0/16,LocalSubnet profile=ALL`|Run the following commands:<br/>`netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="My Application" dir=in action=allow program= "C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe" enable=yes remoteip=157.60.0.1,172.16.0.0/16,LocalSubnet profile=domain`<br/>`netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="My Application" dir=in action=allow program="C:\MyApp\MyApp.exe" enable=yes remoteip=157.60.0.1,172.16.0.0/16,LocalSubnet profile=private`|

For more information about how to add firewall rules, run the following command:
