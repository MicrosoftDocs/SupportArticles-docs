# Slow SMB files transfer speed

Server Message Block (SMB) is the default Windows network file system feature and protocol. Network file transfer speeds are affected by a number of system and network factors. This article provides steps to resolve common file transfer performance issues using SMB.

## Slow transfer

> [!NOTE]
> [SMB signing](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/configure-smb-signing-with-confidence/ba-p/2418102) and [SMB encryption](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-security) are known to reduce SMB transfer speeds. The amount of performance loss depends greatly on the capabilities of the hardware involved. The primary factors being CPU core count and speed, and how much CPU time is being dedicated to other workloads. 
> 
> [SMB signing will be required by default](https://aka.ms/SmbSigningRequired) in Windows 11 24H2 and Windows Server 2025. We do not recommend turning off the SMB client and server signing requirement, they provide significant protections against spoofing, tampering, and relay attacks.

The following steps can be used to analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve common issue with slow SMB transfers.

- Use [`robocopy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) from the command line (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
  - File Explorer (the Windows file manager) performs single-threaded copies and uses buffered IO transfers.
  - Robocopy is optimized for IT administrators to create high performance local and remote file copy tasks.
  - File Explorer is great for convenience and basic use, but lacks the performance optimizations of robocopy that certain tasks require.
  
- Try an unbuffered IO copy for files larger than 1GB by using `robocopy /J` from the command line.

- Enable and use [SMB Compression](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-compression).
  - This will greatly reduce transfer times and bandidth utilization for large files containing significant whitespace, such as virtual machine disks, ISO, DMP, etc.
  - Non-compressible data, like archive files (zip, 7z, rar, etc.), mp4 video, and mp3 will not see significant performance improvements with SMB Compression.
  - SMB compression is available starting with Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.

- SMB speeds can be limited by storage performance.
  - Ensure that the backing storage has the required and available performance characteristics needed to meet the desired network throughput.
  - The approximate real-world storage to network performance speeds, over SMB, are:
    - 110 MB/s of sustained storage throughput per 1Gbps of network bandwidth.
    - 1.1 GB/s of sustained storage throughput per 10Gbps of network bandwidth.
    - 11 GB/s of sustained storage throughput per 100Gbps of network bandwidth.
    - These numbers assume that there are no other bottlenecks on the system, such as CPU or memory exhaustion, and there are no networking errors.
    - Please note that peak storage performance is often much less than sustained storage performance, and that most advertised storage measurements are peak performance.

- [SMB Direct](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-direct?tabs=disable) (SMB over RDMA) may be needed to reach certain network transfer speeds, or reach high speeds without causing high CPU utilitization.

- File copies start fast and then slow down. 
  - A change in copy speed can occur when the initial copy is cached by storage and/or buffered in system memory, and then the cache reaches capacity.
  - Data is then committed directly to disk (write-through) once memory buffers and storage caches have been depleted, limiting performance to the storage mediums sustained write-through limits.
  - Use [RAMMap](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap) from Microsoft SysInternals to determine whether "Mapped File" usage in memory stops growing.
    - This indicates that the memory buffer has been exhausted.
    - RAMMap does not automatically refresh. Use F5 on your keyboard or File > Refresh to update memory usage.
  - Use storage performance monitor counters to determine whether storage performance degrades porportionally to network throughput. For more information, see [Performance tuning for SMB file servers](/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/role/file-server/smb-file-server).
  - Adjust the [remote file dirty page threshold](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/subsystem/cache-memory-management/troubleshoot#remote-file-dirty-page-threshold-is-consistently-exceeded) if performance degrades every 5GB, approximately, on newer versions of Windows.

- Transfers are slow only when using certain technologies or a scale-out file server ([SOFS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/sofs-overview)).
  - Some technologies, typically backup or database based, require the use of disk write-through to maintain data integrity.
  - Windows SOFS requires write-through, as does SQL backup.
  - Disk write-through requires that the storage operation bypass all storage caches and buffers, and must be committed directly to the storage medium before the operation can be completed.
  - A storage system which lacks high write-through performance will be unable to provide performant SMB transfers in these cases.

- Look for signs of network errors. Common networking issues, like packet loss, will cause network level throttling by the TCP congestion algorithm.

- Determine the performance overhead of anti-malware software by temporarily testing SMB transfer performance with file scanning disabled and their file system and network filter drivers unloaded.

- For SMB3, verify that [SMB Multichannel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/dn610980(v=ws.11)) is enabled and working.

- Ensure that the network offloading technologies are enabled.
  - SMB performance is closely tied to network performance.
  - Network offloading technologies, like RSS, LSO, RSC, TCP/UDP checksums, etc. are designed to improve network throughput while lowering CPU usage by the network stack.
  - Please do not disable network offloads.

- On the SMB client, ensure large MTU has not been disabled and bandwidth throttling has not been enabled in SMB by running the following command in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  Set-SmbClientConfiguration -EnableBandwidthThrottling 0 -EnableLargeMtu 1
  ```

- Follow the Windows Server "[Performance tuning for SMB file servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/role/file-server/smb-file-server)" guide to tune the SMB server subsystem.

## Slow transfer when using small files

Slow copy speeds, and low network throughput is expected behavior when transfering a large number of small files over the network using the File Explorer and other single-threaded copy tools. Where a large number of small files is defined as hundreds, thousands, and even millions of files that are less than 1MB in size.

### Issue details

File creation is an "expensive operation" in terms of performance. Both from a network protocol (SMB) and file system perspective. SMB must perform multiple protocol operations to create a file before any data can be transmitted. The file system itself has an additional performance penalty when creating files.

Small file copies hit this penalty repeatedly. The data size, per file, is not sufficient for the network to put enough data in-flight to sustain high network speeds when using a single-threaded copy because more time is spent on creating the files than transferring the file data.

This happens because data transmision must be halted to perform file creation after only a handful of data payloads have been transmitted. While a single large file has a single file creation penalty and then transmits enough data to reach peak network speeds.

### Technical details

Network latency, SMB `create` commands, and antivirus programs contribute to a slower transfer of small files. The following are additional details about this problem:

- SMB issues `create` commands to request that the file is created.
  - Each `create` command generates activity on the file system.
  - After the data is written, the file is closed.
- The process suffers from network, protocol (SMB), and file system latency. 
  - This latency occurs because the file system request is first translated to SMB commands, transmitted over the network, turned back into a file system command, and only then is the actual file system work performed.
  - The process is reversed after the storage operation completes and only then does SMB client recieve a response and can proceed with the next operation.
- Additionally, endpoint protection (antivirus) will often scan network packets and file system operations. 
  - This adds an additional, usually small, amount of latency to the process. 
  - In small file scenarios, the antivirus actions are repeated for each file transfered.
- The result is network throughput speeds of less than 1 MB/s when using a single-threaded file copy tool.

### Speeding up small file copies

- Use `robocopy` with the `/MT` parameter and redirect output using `/log`. 
  - Robocopy is built into Windows and the /MT parameter will enable multithreaded file copies.
  - By default, /MT copies 8 files at a time. It supports up to 128 copies at a time.
  - Please read [robocopy documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) for usage details.

- Use `AzCopy` when moving data to/from Azure. 
  - [AzCopy](https://aka.ms/azcopy) has concurrency (multi-threading) capabilities and several [performance optimzations](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-optimize).

- Use file compression.
   - Compress the small files into a single large archive file.
   - Copy the large file.
   - Extract the files on the destination system (do not extract the files remotely).
   - This may or may not be faster depending on the speed of compression and decompression on the two systems.
   - Use fast compression or no compression archiving to reduce the compression and decompression times.

- Use a trusted third-party (non-Microsoft) file copy tool that supports multi-threaded file copying.

## Slow open of Office documents

Office documents can open slowly, which generally occurs on a WAN connection. The manner in which Office apps (Microsoft Excel, in particular) access and read data is typically what causes the documents to open slowly.

You should verify that the Office and SMB binaries are up-to-date, and then test by having leasing disabled on the SMB server. To verify both conditions have resolved, follow these steps:

1. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 or later versions of Windows:

   ```powershell
   Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableLeasing $false
   ```

2. This works immediately on a new SMB client connection, there is no need to restart the SMB server or client machines. 

To avoid this issue, you can also replicate the file to a local file server. For more information, see [saving Office documents to a network server is slow when using EFS](/office/troubleshoot/office/saving-file-to-network-server-slow).
