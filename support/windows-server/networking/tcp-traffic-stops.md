# TCP traffic stops after you enable both receive-side scaling and Internet Connection Sharing in Windows Vista or in Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2

This article provides a solution to an issue that TCP traffic stops after you enable both receive-side scaling and Internet Connection Sharing.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 927168

## Problem description

After you enable both receive-side scaling and Internet Connection Sharing, TCP traffic stops. For example, the ping command does not work.

This problem occurs if the computer is running one of the following operating systems:

- Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and the Windows Server 2003 Scalable Networking Pack installed
- Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 2 (SP2)
- Windows Vista

## Cause

This problem occurs because receive-side scaling and Internet Connection Sharing are mutually exclusive.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, disable either receive-side scaling or Internet Connection Sharing. Do not enable both receive-side scaling and Internet Connection Sharing at the same time.
