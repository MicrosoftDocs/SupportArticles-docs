# Known issues of TCP/IP performance

> [!NOTE]
> This article is included in a 3-part series. You can review [Part 1: TCP/IP performance overview](overview-of-tcpip-performance.md) and [Part 2: TCP/IP performance underlying network issues](troubleshooting-tcpip-performance-underlying-network.md).

This article describes the following TCP/IP performance issues:

- Slow throughput on high latency and high bandwidth network
- Slow throughput on low latency and high bandwidth network
- Underlying network issues

## Slow throughput speed on a high latency and bandwidth network

Two servers located in different sites are connected over a high latency network. The throughput measured with the [ctsTraffic](https://github.com/Microsoft/ctsTraffic) tool is lower than the baseline.

That's because the TCP Window Scale option isn't enabled on either server. Use Windows Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell to enable the option by setting the TCP receive window autotuning level.

### Use Command Prompt to enable the autotuning level

Run the following command:

```console
netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal 
```

To check if the autotuning level is enabled, use the following command:

```console
netsh int tcp show global
```

### Use PowerShell to enable the autotuning level

Run the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPSetting | Set-NetTCPSetting -AutoTuningLevelLocal Normal
```

To check if the autotuning level is enabled, use the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPSetting | Format-List SettingName,Autotuninglevel*
```

:::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/check-autotuning-level-powershell.png" alt-text="PowerShell cmdlet for checking whether the autotuning level is enabled." border="false":::

> [!NOTE]
> There are five levels for receive window autotuning: Disabled, Highly Restricted, Restricted, Normal, and Experimental. For more information about how autotuning affects the throughput, see [Performance Tuning Network Adapters](/windows-server/networking/technologies/network-subsystem/net-sub-performance-tuning-nics).

## Slow throughput speed on a low latency and high bandwidth network

Two servers are connected on a same network that has low latency and high bandwidth. When you create a baseline or test TCP performance with the ctsTraffic tool, only CPU 0 spikes in a multi-core CPU server.

This issue occurs because the Receive Side Scaling (RSS) or Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ) feature isn't enabled or isn't configured correctly. Use VMQ when the physical machine is a hypervisor. If it isn't, enable RSS on both the Operating System (OS) and on the network cards.

> [!NOTE]
> Wireless network cards don't support RSS or VMQ features.

### Enable RSS for OS

Enable RSS by using Command Prompt or PowerShell as follows:

**Command Prompt**: `netsh int tcp set global rss=enabled`

**PowerShell**: `Set-NetAdapterRss -Name <interface name> -Enabled $True`

### Enable RSS for network cards

First, check if the RSS feature is enabled. Check the network card advanced properties for the related configuration by using the following cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty | Where-Object -property RegistryKeyword -Like *rss* | format-table -AutoSize
```

> [!NOTE]
> Changes to the advanced properties may result in interruption or loss of network connectivity. Before making the changes, refer to the NIC vendor documentation.

Follow these steps to enable RSS for network cards:

1. Run `ncpa.cpl` to open **Network Connections**.
2. Right-click the targeted connection, and then select **Properties** > **Configure**.
3. Under the **Advanced** tab, locate **Receive Side Scaling** in the **Property** list and then set the **Value** to **Enable**.
4. Select **OK**.

RSS can also be enabled by using the PowerShell cmdlet:

```powershell
Set-NetAdapterAdvancedProperty -Name <Interface name> -RegistryKeyword *RSS -RegistryValue 1
```

## Underlying network issues

This section describes how to check for underlying network issues while measuring a throughput baseline or troubleshooting throughput issues.

To get a packet level log analysis, check underlying network issues by using a network packet capturing tool (such as Microsoft Network Monitor, Wireshark, or ctsTraffic).

### Steps to take logs with network packet capturing tools

1. Start logging with [Microsoft Network Monitor](/windows/client-management/troubleshoot-tcpip-netmon) or [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChapterCapture.html) to capture traffic on both endpoints. You can also use the Windows built-in capturing tool as follows:

    1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
    2. Run the following command:

        ```console
        NETSH TRACE START CAPTURE=YES REPORT=DISABLED TRACEFILE=<FILEPATH>.ETL MAXSIZE=512
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > Multiple captures might be required while using the `netsh trace` command.

2. Run the CTStraffic.exe tool to generate a [.csv file](troubleshooting-tcpip-performance-underlying-network.md).
3. Stop the logging. For Windows built-in capturing tool, type `NETSH TRACE STOP` in Command Prompt as an administrator.

### Analyze the capture file

Here's an example showing how to analyze a filtered result. In this scenario, the ctsTraffic tool uses the push pattern (the default pattern), which means the packet is sent from the client to the server.

1. Open the capture file in Microsoft Network Monitor.

2. Filter the network trace by using the `Property.TCPRetransmit==1 && tcp.Port==4444` filter, which locates the retransmission packets. A packet retransmission means that a TCP acknowledgment of the given TCP sequence from the sender is never received.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To analyze an ETL file, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Parser Profiles** > **Windows** > **Set As Active** > **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/analyze-capture-file.png" alt-text="Network trace capture for the retransmitted frame.":::

    As shown in the screenshot, frame `#441` is retransmitted twice, which means it is transmitted by the sender three times. Use the same TCP sequence number (2278877548) to identify this frame.

3. Right-click the **SequenceNumber** in **Frame Details** and select **Add Selected Value to Display Filter**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/add-selected-value-to-display-filter.png" alt-text="Selecting the Add Selected Value to Display Filter option in Frames Details after you right-click the SequenceNumber.":::

4. Disable the previous filter by adding "//" as follows:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/disable-previous-filter.png" alt-text="Disabling the previous filter in Display Filter.":::

5. Select **Apply**. The complete TCP sequence with this sequence number is displayed as follows:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/complete-tcp-sequence.png" alt-text="Selecting the Apply button to show the complete TCP sequence.":::

    This result shows that the original frame `#441` isn't received by the server and is retransmitted by the sender. The retransmission of a frame happens if no acknowledgment of the sequence is received. To understand how TCP works, see [The three-way handshake via TCP/IP](three-way-handshake-via-tcpip.md) and [Description of Windows TCP features](description-tcp-features.md#tcp-retransmission-behavior-and-fast-retransmit). Then, copy the `TCP.SequenceNumber == <value>` sequence filter from the client trace and paste it on the server trace.

    On the server, only one packet of the given sequence is received, as shown in the following result:

    :::image type="content" source="media/tcpip-performance-known-issues/tcp-sequence-server-side.png" alt-text="The TCP sequence that is shown from the server side.":::

    This result proves that there is packet loss from the sender to the receiver on the intermediate network devices. The packets leave the sender but never reach the receiver. It is an issue with underlying networking and it should be resolved by network administrators.

## TCP Loopback Performance

With the Release of Windows Server 2019, the TCP/IP loopback processing model has been changed in order to address certain performance bottlenecks which existed in previous windows releases. This section describes the configuration options available to change the behavior of TCP/IP loopback processing.

The configuration parameters are available through the netsh configuration tool. Each setting can be set individually for IPv4 and IPv6. The default values might vary from different Windows versions.

> [!NOTE]
> On general purpose Windows computers, the default values should not be changed.

If a application developer determines that the loopback data path is the root cause for the applications insufficient performance, the following commands can be used to tailor the configuration towards the individual needs of the application.

```console
netsh int ipv6|ipv4 set gl loopbackexecutionmode=adaptive|inline|worker
netsh int ipv6|ipv4 set gl loopbackworkercount=<value>
netsh int ipv6|ipv4 set gl loopbacklargemtu=enable|disable
```

### Explanation

```console
Loopbackexecutionmode
Worker
```

In this mode, packets are queued on the sender side and processed by a worker thread on the receiver side. This mode favors throughput over latency.

```console
Inline
```

In this mode, processing is done in context of application threads both on sender and receiver side. This mode favors latency over throughput.
  
```console
Adaptive
```

First packets of the data flow are processing inline, and then packets are deferred to worker threads. This mode tries to balance latency and throughput.

```console
Loopbackworkercount
```

Allows to configure the number of worker threads been used.
  
```console
Loopbacklargemtu
```

Allows to configure the use of large MTU, this should be enabled.
