# DirectAccess troubleshooting guidance

This guide provides troubleshooting information for DirectAccess in the Windows operating systems. It's designed to help you identify and resolve problems that are related to DirectAccess.

## Troubleshooting checklist

### Up-to-date

Keep DirectAccess servers and DirectAccess client devices updated. You have to regularly update Windows, drivers, firmware, Hyper-V Integrations Components, and VMware tools. If applicable, you would also have to update the hypervisor that's running the virtual machines.

### OS version

Use a current operating system version: at least Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2019 for the DirectAccess Servers. DirectAccess clients should run a recent version of Windows 10 or Windows 11.

### Monitor

Use monitoring for the DirectAccess servers. Monitor at least the following metrics:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk performance
- Free disk space
- Network adapter availability
- Network adapter throughput and NetNat ports.  

Also, keep a history of performance reporting. The reporting can be helpful when you troubleshoot performance-related issues.

### Infrastructure components

DirectAccess relies on perimeter or internal firewalls, load balancers, routers, switches, and so on. These should also be monitored. For example, if a load balancer is at capacity, this will affect DirectAccess. However, from a DirectAccess perspective, there isn't much that you can do to mitigate this situation.

### Backup

DirectAccess stores all settings in Group Policies. It's essential that you maintain a current and valid backup of all DirectAccess Group Policy settings.

## Best practices

### Sizing and capacity planning

The best troubleshooting approach is the "incremental ramp, test, and monitor" method. The number of DirectAccess servers is very much dependent on what users are doing. This would include using client or server applications, browsing internal websites, and working on or copying large files (such as CAD files).

A good starting point is to use at least four CPUs and more than eight gigabyte (GB) of RAM. A better choice would be eight CPUs, more than 12 GB of RAM, and more than 80 GB of disk space. There is no programmatic preference for physical or virtual servers. Either would work well if correctly sized.

For more information, see [DirectAccess Capacity Planning](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/directaccess/directaccess-capacity-planning).

### Limit

There is no known limit to how many connections a DirectAccess server can accept, apart from resource constraints (CPU, memory, disk space, network throughput, and so on) and NetNat (NAT64) ports.

NetNat (NAT64) is being used on the DirectAccess servers to translate between IPv6 and IPv4. By default, there are 40,999 (6001-49000) NetNat ports available when you use a single IP address on the internal network adapter.

> [!Note]
> The number of DirectAccess active connections does not necessarily relate to the number of NetNat ports that are being used. A small number of DirectAccess client could exhaust all NetNat ports, depending on what users are doing and how many ports are being used by a DirectAccess client.

The NetNat configuration can be viewed by running the `Get-NetNatTransitionConfiguration` command.

## Common issues and solutions

See the following articles to troubleshoot DirectAccess server console issues:

## Data collection

Before contacting Microsoft support, you can gather information about your issue.

### Prerequisites

1. TSSv2 must be run by accounts with administrator privileges on the local system, and EULA must be accepted (once EULA is accepted, TSSv2 won't prompt again).
2. We recommend the local machine `RemoteSigned` PowerShell execution policy.

> [!NOTE]
> If the current PowerShell execution policy doesn't allow running TSSv2, take the following actions:
>
> - Set the `RemoteSigned` execution policy for the process level by running the cmdlet `PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
> - To verify if the change takes effect, run the cmdlet `PS C:\> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`.
> - Because the process level permissions only apply to the current PowerShell session, once the given PowerShell window in which TSSv2 runs is closed, the assigned permission for the process level will also go back to the previously configured state.

### Gather key information before contacting Microsoft support

1. Download [TSSv2](https://aka.ms/getTSSv2) on all nodes and unzip it in the *C:\\tss_tool* folder.
2. Open the *C:\\tss_tool* folder from an elevated PowerShell command prompt.
3. Start the traces on the client and the server by using the following cmdlets:

    > [!NOTE]
	> If you are using an NLB scenario, then start the logs on all servers.

    - DA client:  

        ```powershell
        TSSv2.ps1 -Start -Scenario NET_Dacli
        ```

    - DA server:  

        ```powershell
        TSSv2.ps1 -Start -Scenario NET_DAsrv
        ```

4. Accept the EULA if the traces are run for the first time on the server or the client.
5. Allow recording (PSR or video).
6. Reproduce the issue before entering *Y*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If you collect logs on both the client and the server, wait for this message on both nodes before reproducing the issue.

7. Enter *Y* to finish the log collection after the issue is reproduced.

The traces will be stored in a zip file in the *C:\\MSDATA* folder, which can be uploaded to the workspace for analysis.
