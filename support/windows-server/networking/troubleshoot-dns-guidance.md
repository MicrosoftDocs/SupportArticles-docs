This solution is designed to help you troubleshoot Domain Name System (DNS) scenarios. You can break down DNS troubleshooting into server-side and client-side issues.

## Troubleshooting checklist

### Server-side issues

- IP configuration
- DNS server
- Authoritative data
- Recursion
- Zone Transfer

### Client-side issues

- IP configuration
- Network connectivity

## Common issues and solutions

### DNS records are missing in a DNS zone

This issue can have any one of the following causes.

#### DNS scavenging is misconfigured

If DNS records go missing from DNS zones, scavenging is the most common cause. Even Windows-based computers that have statically-assigned servers register their records every 24 hours. Check whether the NoRefresh and Refresh intervals are too low. For example, if these values are both "less than 24 hours," you lose DNS records.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [Using DNS aging and scavenging](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc757041%28v=ws.10%29).

#### Host "A" record is deleted when the IP address is changed

Sometimes, the host "A" record is deleted on the original DNS server after the host "A" record is registered on the newly configured DNS server IP address (Active Directory Integrated DNS). From a user perspective, anything that depends on name resolution is broken. When the DNS server IP address is changed on the client, the client sends an SOA update to delete its "A" record from the old DNS server. Then, it sends another update to register its "A" record to the new DNS server.

The trouble occurs in Active Directory integrated zones. Issues occur when the DNS Server IP address is changed on the client. When the IP address changes, the client sends a registration request to the new server, and sends a deletion request to old server. Because both servers are already synced, the records aren't registered. However, the "A" record is deleted on the old server, and then it's deleted on both servers because of Active Directory replication.

#### DHCP clients that have option 81 configured unregister host "A" records during host "AAAA" registration

This problem occurs if Option 81 is defined and ISATAP or 6to4 interfaces are present. The DNS Dynamic Update Protocol update incorrectly sets TTL to **0**. This triggers record deletion for IPv6 record registration.

#### The DNS Dynamic Update Protocol update to existing records fails

The DNS Dynamic Update Protocol update to existing records fails. Because of this, the scavenging process considers the records to be aged, and it deletes them.

NETLOGON "event 577X" events are logged for record registration failures of SRV records by the NETLOGON service. Other events are logged for registration failures of host "A" and PTR records. Check the system logs for these failures. Such events may be logged by a client that registers these records. Or they may be logged by the DHCP servers that register the records on the client's behalf.

#### Converting an active dynamic lease to a reservation deletes the "A" and PTR records for that client

This behavior is by design. The DNS records ("A" or PTR) are automatically updated during the next DHCP renewal request from the client.

### Avoid registering unwanted network interface card in DNS

If the network adapter is configured to register the connection address in DNS, then the DHCP/DNS client service registers the record in DNS. Unwanted network cards should be configured not to register the connection address in DNS.

To prevent this issue, make sure that the unwanted network adapter address isn't registered in DNS. Follow these steps:

1. In **Network Connections**, open the properties for the unwanted network card, open TCP/IP properties, select **Advanced** > **DNS**, and then clear the **Register this connections Address in DNS** checkbox.
2. In the left pane, open the DNS server console, highlight the server, and then select **Action** > **Properties**. On the **Interfaces** tab, select **listen on only the following IP addresses**. Remove the unwanted IP address from the list.
3. On the **Zone** properties page, select the **Name server** tab. In addition to the FQDN of the domain controller, you'll see the IP address that's associated with the domain controller. Remove the unwanted IP address if it's listed.
4. Delete the existing unwanted host "A" record of the domain controller.

### DNS query response delays

A DNS query request may time out if the DNS server forwards the query to unreachable forwarders or root hints. To troubleshoot this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open the DNS console on the DNS server, and check whether forwarders or conditional forwarders are reachable. If some of the forwarders are unreachable, remove them.
2. If the DNS server doesn't have to use forwarders and root hints, open the DNS console on the DNS server, open the server **Properties** window, select **Advanced**, and then turn on **Disable recursion**. (This also disables forwarders.)

### Event ID 4004 and event ID 4013

Event message:  
> DNS server was unable to open Active Directory. This DNS server is configured to use directory service information and cannot operate without access to the directory. The DNS server will wait for the directory to start. If the DNS server is started but the appropriate event has not been logged, then the DNS server is still waiting for the directory to start.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [Troubleshoot AD DS and restart the DNS Server service](troubleshoot-dns-event-id-4013.md#resolution).

### DNS Server geo-location policy doesn't work as expected

You use an Active Directory integrated zone (default zone scope) that's named contoso.com, and geo-location zone scopes that are associated with specific subnets. You use the Windows PowerShell `Add-DnsServerQueryResolutionPolicy` cmdlets to configure DNS resolution policies. 

The desired outcome is that a client tries to locate a requested resource, first in the local zone scope and then in the default zone scope. However, after the organization configures these policies, clients from the defined subnets can't successfully resolve records that are hosted in the default zone scope (contoso.com). For example, clients can't resolve **hostA.contoso.com**. When the DNS server receives such requests, it returns a "Server Failure" message.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [DNS server geo-location policy doesn't work as expected](dns-server-geo-location-policy-doesnt-work-as-expected.md).

### Forwarded DNS name resolution fails for dual-stacked queries

You're using a third-party DNS server solution, and you can't consistently resolve names when you use conditional forwarding.

The local DNS server (10.100.100.70) can connect to the DNS server that's configured as a conditional forwarder (10.133.3.250). The first request from the DNS server to the conditional forwarder successfully resolves a name (for example, nbob1.contoso.com). After some time, name resolution stops working. An nslookup query to the conditional forwarder returns a "nonexistent domain" error message.

If you clear the DNS server cache on the forwarding computer (the local DNS server), name resolution resumes. However, this fix is temporary.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [Forwarded DNS name resolution fails for dual-stacked queries](forwarded-dns-name-resolution-fails-for-dual-stacked-queries.md).

### DNS Server loses its NIC Teaming configuration

Consider the following scenario:  

- The DNS server computer has multiple network adapters that you use in a NIC Teaming configuration.
- You configure the DNS server to listen on the IP address of the teaming network adapter. 
- On the **Interfaces** tab of the DNS server properties dialog box in DNS Manager, you can configure the IP address that you want to use.

After you restart the DNS server, Windows deletes the setting. The DNS server starts listening on all IP addresses again.

When this change occurs, Windows logs Event ID 410 in the DNS server event log:

> The DNS server list of restricted interfaces does not contain a valid IP address for the server computer. The DNS server will use all IP interfaces on the computer. Use the DNS manager server properties, interfaces dialog box, to verify and reset the IP addresses the DNS server should listen on. For more information, see "To restrict a DNS server to listen only on selected addresses" in the online Help.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [DNS server reverts to listening on all IP addresses instead of the configured NIC Teaming IP address](dns-server-loses-teaming-nic-configuration.md).

### DNS record registration behavior when the DHCP server manages dynamic DNS updates

You have an infrastructure that uses Windows Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients and Microsoft DHCP servers to assign and manage IP addresses. On the DHCP server, you select **Enable DNS dynamic updates according to the settings below** and **Always dynamically update DNS records**. In this configuration, you expect the DHCP server to manage dynamic DNS updates for A records and PTR records. However, you observe that both the client and the server create DNS records. Depending on your configuration, this behavior has the following effects:

- If you configure the DNS zones for **Nonsecure and secure** dynamic updates, you see that the DHCP server creates records, and then the DHCP client deletes and re-creates the same records.
- If you configure the DNS zones for **Secure only** dynamic updates, DNS records might become inconsistent. Both the DHCP server and the DHCP client create records. However, the DHCP server can't update records that the DHCP client creates, and the DHCP client can't update records that the DHCP server creates.

To troubleshoot this issue, see [DNS record registration behavior when the DHCP server is set to "Always dynamically update DNS records"](dns-registration-behavior-when-dhcp-server-manages-dynamic-dns-updates.md).

## Data collection

Before contacting Microsoft support, you can gather information about your issue.

### Prerequisites

- TSS must be run by accounts that have administrator privileges on the local system, and the EULA must be accepted. (After the EULA is accepted, TSS won't prompt again.)
- We recommend the LocalMachine `RemoteSigned` PowerShell execution policy.

> [!NOTE]
> If the current PowerShell execution policy doesn't allow running TSS, take the following actions:
>
> - Set the `RemoteSigned` execution policy for the process level by running the cmdlet, `PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
> - To verify that the change takes effect, run the cmdlet, `PS C:\> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`.
> - Because the process level permissions apply to only the current PowerShell session, after the given PowerShell window in which TSS runs is closed, the assigned permission for the process level also reverts to the previously configured state.

### Gather key information before contacting Microsoft support

1. Download [TSS](https://aka.ms/getTSS) on all nodes and unzip it in the *C:\\tss* folder.
2. Open the *C:\\tss* folder at an elevated PowerShell command prompt.
3. Start the traces on the client and the server by using the following cmdlets:

    - Client:  

        ```powershell
        TSS.ps1 -Scenario NET_DNScli
        ```

    - Server:  

        ```powershell
        TSS.ps1 -Scenario NET_DNSsrv
        ```

4. Accept the EULA if the traces are run for the first time on the server or the client.
5. Allow recording (PSR or video).
6. Reproduce the issue before entering *Y*.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If you collect logs on both the client and the server, wait for this message on both nodes before reproducing the issue.

7. Enter *Y* to finish the log collection after the issue is reproduced.

The traces are stored in a compressed file in the *C:\\MS_DATA* folder. This can be uploaded to the workspace for analysis.
