# Troubleshoot general issues related to Remote Access

This article contains troubleshooting information for general issues related to Remote Access.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016

## GPO retrieval error

**Error received**

DirectAccess server GPO settings can't be retrieved. Ensure you have edit permissions for the GPO.

The Remote Access management console is unresponsive after receiving this error.

**Cause**

DirectAccess can't access the GPO of one of the entry points in the deployment and as a result the configuration fails to load.

**Solution**

Make sure that each entry point in the deployment has a corresponding GPO on its domain controller and verify that the logged on user has read and write permissions for all GPOs configured in the Remote Access deployment.

As a workaround, use the configuration cmdlets instead of using the Remote Access management console; for example, using `Get-RemoteAccess` and `Get-DAEntryPoint`.

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario does not occur when the server GPO of the current entry point isn't available.

You can use the `Get-DAEntryPointDC` cmdlet to list all domain controllers that store server GPOs and `Get-DAMultiSite` in conjunction with `Get-RemoteAccess` to retrieve a complete list of the server GPOs in the deployment. For example:

```powershell
$ServerGpos = Get-DAEntryPointDC | ForEach-Object {
   @{
       GpoName = (Get-RemoteAccess -EntryPoint $_.EntryPointName).ServerGpoName;
        DC = $_.DomainControllerName }
}
$ServerGpos | ForEach-Object { $GpoName = $_['GpoName'] ; $DC = $_['DC'] ; Write-Host "Server GPO '$GpoName' on DC '$DC'" }
```

## Windows 7 to Windows 8 or 10 client upgrade

**Symptom**

After a Windows 7 client upgrades to Windows 10 or Windows 8 in a multisite deployment, the DirectAccess connection isn't visible in the Networks list.

**Cause**

The Windows 7 GPOs in a multisite deployment do not contain the Windows 8 Network Connectivity Assistant configuration.

Windows 7 clients should use DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant to monitor their DirectAccess connectivity status which requires a separate manual configuration in the Windows 7 client GPOs. When Windows 7 clients are upgraded to Windows 10 or Windows 8, the Network Connectivity Assistant will not function if the Windows 7 client GPO is still applied.

**Solution**

If DirectAccess Connectivity Assistant settings are configured in the Windows 7 GPOs, you can resolve this issue before upgrading client computers by modifying the Windows 7 GPOs using the following PowerShell cmdlets:

```powershell
Set-GPRegistryValue -Name <Windows7GpoName> -Domain <DomainName> -Key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityAssistant" -ValueName "TemporaryValue" -Type Dword -Value 1
Remove-GPRegistryValue -Name <Windows7GpoName> -Domain <DomainName> -Key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityAssistant"
```

If a client has already been upgraded or the DCA isn't configured, move the client computer to the Windows 10 or Windows 8 security group.

## General cmdlet errors

### Issue 1

**Error received**

Domain controller \<domain_controller\> can't be reached for \<server_name or entry_point_name\>.

**Cause**

To maintain the configuration consistency in a multisite deployment, it is important to make sure that each GPO is managed by a single domain controller. When the domain controller that manages an entry point's server GPO isn't available, Remote Access configuration settings can't be read or modified.

**Solution**

Follow the procedure "To change the domain controller that manages server GPOs" described in [2.4. Configure GPOs](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/ras/multisite/configure/step-2-configure-the-multisite-infrastructure#ChangeDC).

### Issue 2

**Error received**

The primary domain controller in domain \<domain_name\> can't be reached.

**Cause**

To maintain the configuration consistency in a multisite deployment, it is important to make sure that each GPO is managed by a single domain controller. Client GPOs are managed on the primary domain controller. If the primary domain controller isn't available, Remote Access configuration settings can't be read or modified.

**Solution**

Follow the procedure "To transfer the PDC emulator role" described in [2.4. Configure GPOs](/windows-server/remote/remote-access/ras/multisite/configure/step-2-configure-the-multisite-infrastructure#TransferPDC).
