# How to use PortQry to troubleshoot Active Directory connectivity issues

This article describes how to run PortQry to test network connectivity for any Windows component or scenario on any version of Windows.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 816103

## Introduction  

PortQry is a command-line utility that you can use to troubleshoot TCP/IP connectivity used by Windows components and features. The utility reports the port status of Transition Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports on a remote computer. You can run PortQry to test network connectivity for any Windows component or scenario on any version of Windows.

This article describes how to use portqry to verify basic TCP/IP connectivity for Active Directory and Active Directory related components including:

- Active Directory Domain Services (ADDS)
- Active Directory for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- Remote procedure call (RPC)
- Domain Name Service (DNS)
- Other ADDS-related components
- Other components on which ADDS is dependent

Verifying network connectivity over the required ports and protocols is especially useful when domain controllers are deployed across intermediate devices including firewalls.

## Install PortQry

### Download Portqry.exe

PortQry .exe is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center. To download the PortQry .exe, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

## More information

PortQry reports the status of a port in one of three ways:

- Listening: A process is listening on the target port on the target system. PortQry received a response from the port.
- Not Listening: No process is listening on the target port on the target system. PortQry received an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)"Destination Unreachable - Port Unreachable" message back from the target UDP port. Or, if the target port is a TCP port, Portqry received a TCP acknowledgment packet with the Reset flag set.
- Filtered: The target port on the target system is being filtered. PortQry didn't receive a response from the target port. A process may or may not be listening on the port. By default, TCP ports are queried three times and UDP ports are queried one time before reporting the target port is filtered.

With PortQry, you can also query an LDAP service. It sends an LDAP query, using either UDP or TCP, and interprets the LDAP server's response to the query. The response from the LDAP server is parsed, formatted, and returned to the user.

RPC interfaces offered by Active Directory can use dynamic server ports (most are configurable.) Clients use the RPC Endpoint Mapper to find the server port of the RPC interface of a specific Active Directory service.

The RPC end point mapper database listens to port 135. This means that TCP port 135 a required port for most deployments that go beyond basic LDAP queries. It's also required for all clients that are member of a domain.

For more information about PortQry, see:

[310099](https://support.microsoft.com/help/310099) Description of the Portqry.exe command-line utility

You can find a list of ports and protocols that Windows uses including Active Directory, DFS, DFSR, Certificate Services, and all other services in the following knowledge base article:

[832017](https://support.microsoft.com/help/832017#method1) Service overview and network port requirements for Windows

> [!NOTE]
> Active Directory and other services that use ephemeral ports must have connectivity from port 135 to all the listed in the Service overview and network port requirements for Windows article.

Ports and protocols specific to AD can also be found in the article:

PortQry knows how to send a query to the RPC end point mapper (using UDP and TCP) and interpret the response. This query displays all of the end points that are registered with the RPC end point mapper. The response from the end point mapper is parsed, formatted, and returned to the user.

If PortQry isn't available, you can use LDP.EXE to connect to the Domain Controller on port 389 with the **Connectionless** check box activated.

Another alternative to PortQry is NLTEST, but it doesn't work for arbitrary servers. The server must be a Domain Controller in the same domain as the machine that you run the tool on. If this is the case, you can use Nltest /sc_reset **\<domain name>** \ **\<computer name>** to force a security channel onto a specific domain controller.

## Using portqry

### Example 1: Using Portqry to test connectivity over a specific port and protocol using UDP port 389 as an example

This example demonstrates how to use PortQry to determine if the LDAP service is responding. By examining the response, you can determine which LDAP service is listening on the port and some details about its configuration. This information can be useful in troubleshooting various problems.

By default, LDAP is configured to listen to port 389. The example call specifies the server to query using the UDP protocol:

`PortQry -n <fqdn> -p udp -e 389`

PortQry automatically resolves UDP port 389 using the %SystemRoot%\System32\Drivers\\...\Services file included in Windows Server 2003 and later computers. In the example output below, the port resolves to an LDAP service that is active and PortQry reports that the port is LISTENING or FILTERED.

PortQry then sends a formatted LDAP query to which it receives a response. It returns the whole response to the user and reports that the port is LISTENING. If PortQry doesn't received a response to the query, it reports that the port is FILTERED.

#### Sample output

[929852](https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852) Guidance for configuring IPv6 in Windows for advanced users

### Example 2: Identifying services that have registered with RPC endpoint mapper

This example demonstrates how to use PortQry to determine which services or applications are registered with the target server's RPC end point mapper database. The output includes each application's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID), annotated name (if one exists), the protocol the application uses, the network address that the application is bound to, and the application's end point (port number, named pipe in square brackets). This information can be useful in troubleshooting various problems.

By default, the RPC end point mapper database is configured to listen to port 135. The example call specifies the server to query using the UDP protocol:

`portqry -n <fqdn> -p udp -e 135`

#### Sample output

> Querying target system called:
>
> *\<fqdn>*
>
> Attempting to resolve name to IP address...
>

PortQry can send a correctly formatted DNS query (using UDP or TCP). The utility sends a DNS query for "`portqry.microsoft.com`." PortQry then waits for a response from the target DNS server. Whether the DNS response to the query is negative or positive is irrelevant because any response indicates that the port is listening.
