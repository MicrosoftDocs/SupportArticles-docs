# WSAEMSGSIZE - Error 10040 in Winsock 2.0

This article helps to fix WSAEMSGSIZE - Error 10040 in Winsock 2.0.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2

## Symptoms

The Microsoft Winsock 2.0 WSARecvFrom() function does not function and may display the following error message when used in a User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket program:

The WSAEMSGSIZE error message may appear when the buffer size is not large enough to accommodate the receiving datagram.
