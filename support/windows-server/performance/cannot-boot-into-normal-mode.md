## Cause

This issue happens when **SAFEBOOT** option is checked in the **System Configuration Utility**, under the **Boot** tab.

## Resolution

To fix the issue, follow the steps:

Using the System Configuration Tool on Windows 2003/Windows XP:

**Step 1:** Close all programs so that you have nothing open and are at the desktop.

**Step 2:** Click the **Start** button, and then click **Run**.

**Step 3:** In the **Run** field type *msconfig* as shown in the image below.

**Step 6:** Uncheck the mark in the checkbox labeled **/SAFEBOOT** designated by the red box above. Then press the **OK** button and then the **OK** button again. Windows will now prompt if you would like to reboot. Press the **Yes** button and machine can boot into normal mode now.

> [!NOTE]
> With the **/SAFEBOOT** option checked, you'll notice an additional entry in Boot.ini file as seen below. If you see the box check for /SAFEBOOT, remove the check.

Even though this document focuses primarily on Windows 2003 Server and Windows XP, this information applies to Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.

On the Operating System running Vista or above Boot Configuration Data Editor (Bcdedit.exe) command-line tool can be handy:

Following command will delete the **/SAFEBOOT** option and help machine boot into normal mode:

***bcdedit /deletevalue {default} safeboot***  

Open administrative command prompt to run above `bcdedit` command. For detailed command and option information at the command prompt, type ***bcdedit.exe /?*** command.
