## More information

If verbose logging isn't enabled, you'll still receive normal status messages such as "Applying your personal settings..." or "Applying computer settings..." when you start up, shut down, log on, or log off from the computer. However, if verbose logging is enabled, you'll receive additional information, such as "RPCSS is starting" or "Waiting for machine group policies to finish....".
