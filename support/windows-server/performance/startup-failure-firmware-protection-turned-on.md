# Startup failure when Firmware protection is turned on

Assume Windows Server 2019 (or an earlier version) is running with a [Secured-core](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/protect-your-infrastructure-with-secured-core-server/ba-p/2176002) Server capable hardware.

The Secured-core functionality isn't supported in Windows Server 2019 and earlier versions. If the [System Guard Secure Launch](/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-system-guard/system-guard-secure-launch-and-smm-protection#windows-security-center) is enabled either through the **Firmware protection** switch in the Windows Security app UI or through a manual edit of the corresponding registry key, the startup can fail.

To recover from the startup failure, go to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) settings and disable Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).

Contact your hardware manufacturer for instructions on how to disable DRTM. The relevant settings are labeled differently for different silicon platforms.
