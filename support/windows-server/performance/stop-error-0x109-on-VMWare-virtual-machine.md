# Stop error 0x109: CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION on a VMware virtual machine

This article provides the resolution of fixing the Stop error 0x109: CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION on a VMware virtual machine.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2902739

## Symptoms

On a Windows Server Virtual Machine that is running VMware ESXi 5.0.x, you receive a "CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION" Stop error code that begins as follows:

> Bugcheck code 00000109  
Arguments a3a01f58 \`92797517 b3b72bde \`e4f976b6 00000000 \`c0000103 00000000\` 00000007

## Cause

This problem occurs because the system detects a Critical MSR modification, and then it crashes.

## Resolution

To resolve this problem, go to the following VMware website:

[Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2012 virtual machines fail with a blue screen and report the error: CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (2060019)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2060019)

It is a known issue that affects ESXi 5.0.x. For more information, contact VMware.

To work around this issue, manually create a CPUID mask for the affected virtual machines. To do it, follow these steps:

1. Turn off the virtual machine.
2. Right-click the virtual machine, and then click **Edit Settings**.
3. Click the **Options** tab.
4. Under **Advanced**, click **CPUID Mask**.
5. Click **Advanced**.
6. In the **Register** column, locate the **edx** register under **Level 80000001**.
7. In the **Value** field, enter the following character string exactly:

   \----:0---:----:----:----:----:----:----

8. Click **OK** two times.

> CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)

This Stop error is generated when the kernel detects that critical kernel code or data has been corrupted. Typically, any of the following situations can cause this corruption:

- A driver inadvertently or deliberately modified critical kernel code or data.
- A developer tried to set a standard kernel breakpoint by using a kernel debugger that was not attached when the system was started. Standard breakpoints (bp) can be set only if the debugger is attached at startup. Processor breakpoints (ba) can be set at any time.
- A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data might have been stored in memory that failed.
