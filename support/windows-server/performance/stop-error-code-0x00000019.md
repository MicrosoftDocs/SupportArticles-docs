# Error message on a Windows Server 2003-based computer: Stop error code 0x00000019

This article provides workarounds for an issue where you receive a Stop error 00000019 when NTFS generates a 8.3-formatted name for a file that has a long file name.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2003  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 948289

## Symptoms

You may receive a Stop error message that resembles the following on a Windows Server 2003-based computer:

> STOP: 0x00000019 (**parameter1**, **parameter2**, **parameter3**, **parameter4**)  
BAD_POOL_HEADER

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The parameters in this Stop error message vary, depending on the configuration of the computer and on the type of the issue.
> - Not all 0x00000019 Stop errors are caused by this problem.

## Cause

This problem occurs because the pool memory is unexpectedly corrupted. This problem occurs when the NTFS file system creates a name in the 8.3 name format for a file that has a long file name.

## Workaround

To work around this problem, disable 8.3 name creation. To do this, use one of the following methods.

### Method 1

1. Run the following command at a command prompt:

    ```console
    fsutil behavior set disable8dot3 1
    ```

2. Restart the computer.
