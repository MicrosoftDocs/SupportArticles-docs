# Application or service memory leaks troubleshooting guidance

This article provides guidance on troubleshooting applications or services with memory leak behaviors and how to proceed.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; All supported versions of Windows Server and Windows Client

You see Event ID 2004 repeatedly in the system log. As the event source mentions, there's a resource exhaustion in the system on the virtual memory space. The description lists the system's top memory consumers at that time.

Apart from this event, you also notice high memory consumption by checking live or historical data from monitoring tools, or by using the Windows Task Manager.

The following troubleshooting process is helpful for both scenarios where first-party and third-party processes might be leaking memory. For first-party processes, you can use the public symbol store available. However, if you can't see the actual function in a third-party process, you can engage the vendor for further check. Even if the function doesn't show, the allocation stack should indicate a third-party module.

## Before you begin

You might see the following examples in the system event log and Task Manager.

```output
Log Name:      System
Source:        Microsoft-Windows-Resource-Exhaustion-Detector
Date:          <DateTime>
Event ID:      2004
Task Category: Resource Exhaustion Diagnosis Events
Level:         Warning
Keywords:      Events related to exhaustion of system commit limit (virtual memory).
User:          SYSTEM
Computer:      WIN-LAB
Description:
Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition. The following programs consumed the most virtual memory:wpa.exe (9844) consumed 13714722816 bytes, msedgewebview2.exe (112572) consumed 3037757440 bytes, and EngHost.exe (37280) consumed 2619834368 bytes.
```

The memory shown in the default list of columns isn't the one that should be focused on, since it represents the memory privately used by the process but backed by physical memory (working set). You need to verify virtual memory that is used by the operating system for its operation regardless of the way the virtual memory is backed (RAM or pagefile). In this case, you need to verify **Commit size**.

Here are some examples:

:::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshoot-application-service-memory-leaks/task-manager-virtual-memory-commit-size.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Task Manager showing the VirtMemTest32 process with high commit size.":::

You can use [VMMap](/sysinternals/downloads/vmmap) and [Windows Performance Toolkit](/windows-hardware/test/wpt) for troubleshooting.

VMMap is used to determine the type of memory leaks. The Windows Performance Toolkit includes the Windows Performance Recorder (WPR) tool and the Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA) tool, which are used to collect and analyze data.

## Gather data

During this stage, if the memory usage is growing over time and isn't released, it indicates a leak pattern. The increase doesn't need to be a straight line to fall into this pattern. The key point is that the memory usage keeps on increasing over time.

:::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshoot-application-service-memory-leaks/increase-leak-pattern.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the memory usage with an increase pattern.":::

At this point, with a leak pattern, you need to determine the leaking memory type. Open VMMap and select the process that is identified as the leaking memory.

### Determine the memory type

When virtual allocation memory is leaked, it's represented in VMMap as **Private Data**:

:::image type="content" source="./media/troubleshoot-application-service-memory-leaks/virtual-memory-private-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual allocation memory leaks represented as Private Data in VMMap.":::

If you have a memory dump of the process, you can run the following command to see the memory layout. Virtual allocation shows as `<unknown>`:

```console

When heap allocation memory is leaked, it's represented with **Heap**:

### Collect trace data for virtual allocation memory

Since you have the way to identify the leaking memory, the next step is to collect reproducible data to determine the driver responsible for the leaking allocations.

Use the following command to collect data when the process shows the behavior. **WPR.exe** is included natively on operating systems after Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.

Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:

```console
C:\>wpr -start VirtualAllocation
```

Allow the process to run for some time. You can monitor the growth of memory consumption with Task Manager (**Commit size**).

Since it only collects virtual allocation data, the trace file doesn't grow so large, so you can leave it running for several minutes. Once you see enough leaked memory, stop the trace by using the following command:

```console
C:\>wpr -stop virtalloc.etl
```

### Collect trace data for heap allocation memory

Like virtual allocation, you can also use WPR for heap tracing.

However, a registry modification is required to enable the heap tracing. You can manually modify the registry or run the following command to enable heap tracing for the target process (for example, **VirtMemTest32.exe**).

Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:

```console
C:\>wpr -heaptracingconfig VirtMemTest32.exe enable
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the process is running when you run the command, restart the process for the setting to be enabled.

Heap tracing is successfully enabled for process **VirtMemTest64.exe**.

The result is:

Registry key: `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\VirtMemTest32.exe`  
Value name: `Tracing Flags`  
Value type: `REG_DWORD`  
Value data: `0x00000001 (1)`

You can delete the registry key or set the value to `0` after troubleshooting.

Use the following command to collect data when the process shows the behavior. **WPR.exe** is included natively on operating systems after Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.

Run the following command from a command prompt as an administrator:

```console
C:\>wpr -start Heap
```

Allow the process to run for some time. You can monitor the growth of memory consumption with Task Manager (**Commit size**).

Since it only collects heap data, the trace file doesn't grow so large, so you can leave it running for several minutes. Once you see enough leaked memory, stop the trace by using the following command:

```console
C:\>wpr -stop Heap.etl
```

## Analyze data

Use **WPA.exe** to open the trace. WPA can be downloaded via the Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK) package for the Windows Performance Toolkit.

Open WPA and set up the symbol path. In the menu, select **Trace** > **Configure Symbol Paths**. Configure symbols by adding the public symbol path as `srv*C:\LocalPubSymbols*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols`, so you can load symbols (in the menu, select **Trace** > **Load Symbols**) before checking the trace.

### Analyze trace data for virtual allocation memory

Replicate the following view by replacing the process with the one you've identified as relevant. Ensure that the **Commit Stack** column is on the left of the gold/yellow line. Drill down by expanding the stack, and you see the function that shows the allocation of virtual memory. The driver listed before (up) the function is the one calling to that operation.

### Analyze trace data for heap allocation memory

Replicate the following view by replacing the process with the one you've already identified as relevant. Ensure that the **Handle** and **Stack** columns are on the left of the gold/yellow line. Drill down by expanding the stack, and you see the function that shows the allocation of heap memory. The driver listed before (up) the function is the one calling to that operation.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't see the heap allocation graph, it's because the registry key isn't set correctly. Review the steps.
