# Use Dumpchk.exe to check a memory dump file

This article describes how to check a memory dump file by using Dumpchk.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 156280

## Summary

Dumpchk is a command-line utility you can use to verify that a memory dump file has been created correctly. Dumpchk does not require access to symbols.

Dumpchk is located in the following locations:

- Windows NT 4.0 CD-ROM: Support\Debug\\\<Platform>\Dumpchk.exe

- Windows 2000 CD-ROM: Install the Support Tools by running Setup.exe from the Support\Tools folder on the CD-ROM. By default, Dumpchk.exe is installed to the Program Files\Support Tools folder.

## Dumpchk command-line switches

Dumpchk has the following command-line switches:

DUMPCHK [options] \<CrashDumpFile>

- -? Display the command syntax.

- -p Prints the header only (with no validation).

- -v Specifies verbose mode.

- -q Performs a quick test. Not available in the Windows 2000.

Additional switches that are only available in Windows 2000 Dumpchk.exe version:

- -c Do dump validation.

- -x Extra file validation. Takes several minutes.

- -e Do dump exam.

- -y \<Path> Set the symbol search path for dump exam.
  - If the symbol search path is empty, the CD-ROM
  - is used for symbols.

- -b \<Path> Set the image search path for dump exam.
  - If the symbol search path is empty, \<SystemRoot>\system32
  - is used for symbols.

- -k \<File> Set the name of the kernel to File.

- -h \<File> Set the name of the hal to File.

Dumpchk displays some basic information from the memory dump file, then verifies all the virtual and physical addresses in the file. If any errors are found in the memory dump file, Dumpchk reports them. The following is an example of the output of a Dumpchk command:

```output

**************--> Validating the integrity of the PsLoadedModuleList  
**************--> Performing a complete check (^C to end)  
**************--> Validating all physical addresses  
**************--> Validating all virtual addresses  
**************--> This dump file is good!
```

If there is an error during any portion of the output displayed above, the dump file is corrupted and analysis cannot be performed.

In this example, the most important information (from a debugging standpoint) is the following:

```output
MajorVersion . . . . .free system  
MinorVersion . . . . .1057  
MachineImageType . . .i386  
NumberProcessors . . .1  
BugCheckCode . . . . .0xc000021a  
BugCheckParameter1 . .0xe131d948  
BugCheckParameter2 . .0x00000000  
BugCheckParameter3 . .0x00000000  
BugCheckParameter4 . .0x00000000
```

This information can be used to determine what Kernel STOP Error occurred and, to a certain extent, what version of Windows was in use.
