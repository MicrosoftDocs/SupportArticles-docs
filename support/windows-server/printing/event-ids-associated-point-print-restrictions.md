These events may be logged due to Point and Print Restrictions.

## Resolution

Configure the Point and Print Restrictions policy to Disabled.

- User Configuration / Administrative Templates / Control Panel / Printers  

>[!Note]
>The User Configuration policy has been deprecated but is still available for backwards compatibility with legacy OS's.  It is generally recommended to configure both policies to "Disabled" for uniform behavior across all clients.
