### Save connection settings

You can save a connection as a Remote Desktop protocol (.rdp) file. An `.rdp` file contains all the information for a connection to a terminal server, including the Options settings that were configured when the file was saved. You can customize any number of `.rdp` files, including files for connecting to the same server with different settings. For example, you can save a file that connects to MyServer in full screen mode and another file that connects to the same computer in 800Ã—600 screen size.

To save your connection settings, follow these steps:

1. Open Remote Desktop Connection, and then select **Options**.
2. Specify the connection settings that you want for this connection.
3. On the **General** tab, select **Save As**.
4. In the **File name** box, type a file name for the saved connection file, and then select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> To edit an .rdp file to change the connections settings it contains, select **Start** > **My Documents**, right-click the file, and then select **Edit**.
