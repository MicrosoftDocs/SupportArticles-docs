_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2016

You receive the following error message after completing [the configuration of the Remote Desktop Connection Broker (RD Connection Broker) server for high availability](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/rds-connection-broker-cluster#step-3-configure-the-connection-brokers-for-high-availability).

> Could not create the database \<DatabaseName>. Please check that the broker server has access to the SQL server, the path for -DatabaseFilePath parameter exists and contains the SQL Server database file, the connection to SQL database is correct and SQL database is online.

## Verify permission for the RD Connection Broker server on SQL Server 

Verify that correct permission is assigned to the RD Connection Broker Server on the SQL Server. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the SQL server.
2. Open **Microsoft SQL Management Studio**.
3. Go to **Security** > **Logins** in **Object Explorer**, right-click the RD Connection Broker server, and select **Properties**.
4. Make sure the **dbcreator** and **public** checkboxes are selected under the **Server roles** pane.

> [!NOTE]
> The RD Connection Broker server is now allowed to create databases in the SQL server. The RD Connection Broker service will attempt to migrate Windows Internal Database (WID) to a SQL Server instance when converting the RD Connection Broker server to a high available cluster.

## Check case-sensitivity of SQL Server collation

The database creation script for Remote Desktop Services (RDS) supports only case-insensitive collations. Make sure that the instance collation of the SQL Server database is set to be case-insensitive.
