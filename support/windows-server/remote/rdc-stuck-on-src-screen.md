This article provides a solution to the issue in which the remote desktop connection stays in the connecting to status.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2915774

## Symptoms

Assume a scenario in which you use a remote desktop connection for operating system Windows 7 or later versions. In this scenario, Remote desktop connection is stuck for several seconds when it displays the following texts:

> Remote Desktop Connection  
Connecting to:  
Securing remote connection...

## Cause

Remote desktop connection uses the highest possible security level encryption method between the source and destination.

In Windows 7 or later versions, the remote desktop connection uses the SSL (TLS 1.0) Protocol and the encryption is Certificate-based.

It means the authentication is performed by using self-signed certificates (default), or a certificate issued by a certification authority installed on the remote session host server (Terminal Server).

If you use a self-signed certificate, the system tries to retrieve the trusted certification authority list from the Internet to check the publish and revocation status of the certificate. Therefore, the **Securing remote connection** screen may appear for a while.

## Workaround

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods:

### Method 1

- If you're using a self-signed certificate, import the certificate to the source. To do this, follow these steps on the destination:

  1. Sign in as an administrator in the destination, select **Start**, enter *mmc* in the **Search programs and files** box and run Microsoft Management Console.
  2. On the **File** menu, select the **Add/Remove Snap-in** option.
  3. From the list of **Available snap-ins**, select **Certificates** and then select the **Add** button.
  4. On the **Certificate Snap-in** screen, select the **Computer account** check box and then select **Next**.
  5. On the **Select Computer** screen, select **Local Computer** and then select the **Finish** button.
  6. Go back to the **Add/Remove Snap-In** dialog box and then select the **OK** button.
  7. In the left pane of the console window, expand **Console Route** > **Certificates (Local Computer)** > **Remote Desktop** > **Certificates**.
  8. Double-click the Certificate in the middle pane to open it.
  9. On the **Detail** tab, select the **Copy to File...** button.
  10. The **Certificate Export Wizard** will open. Leave the default settings and then save the file in any folder.
  11. Copy the exported file to the source computer.

- Then follow these steps on the source:

  1. Sign in as an administrator in the source, select **Start**, enter *mmc* in the **Search programs and files** box, and run the mmc.exe.
  2. Select the **File** menu and then select the **Add/Remove Snap-in** option.
  3. From the list of **Available snap-ins**, select **Certificates** and then select the **Add** button.
  4. On the **Certificate Snap-in** screen, select the **Computer account** check box and then select **Next**.
  5. On the **Select Computer** screen, select **Local Computer** and then select the **Finish** button.
  6. Go back to the **Add/Remove Snap-In** dialog box and then select the **OK** button.
  7. In the left pane of the console window, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)** > **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** > **Certificates**. Right-click to select **All Tasks**, and then select **Import...** from the menu.
  8. The **Certificate Import Wizard** will open. Follow the instructions in the wizard to start the import.

      1. In the **Certificate file to import** window, specify the file that was copied from the destination computer.
      2. In the **Certificate store** window, verify that:

         - **Place all certificates in the following store** is selected
         - **Certificate Store** lists **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > By default, the self-signed certificate expires in six months. If it has expired, the certificate will be recreated. You must import the recreated certificate to the source again.

### Method 2

Deploy a Group Policy Object to the client to turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update. To do it, follow these steps on a Windows Server 2012 R2-based computer:

1. Open Group Policy Management Console. To do it, hold the Windows key and press the r key. Type *Gpmc.msc* in the **Run** box, and then select **OK**.
2. Create a new Group Policy Object (GPO) or select an existing Group Policy Object (GPO) to change.
3. Right-click the selected Group Policy Object (GPO) and then select **Edit** and browse to the following Group Policy:  
    **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Internet Communication Management** > **Internet Communication settings**
4. In the details pane, double-click **Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update**, and then select **Enabled**.
