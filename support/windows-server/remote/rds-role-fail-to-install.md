## Cause

The issue occurs if the Windows Firewall service is set to disabled. When the Windows Firewall service is not running, firewall exception cannot be set. This causes the WMI call *SetAllowTSConnections* that sets the RDP settings to fail.

The Installation uses the *SetAllowTSConnections* Method of the *Win32_TerminalServiceSetting* WMI Class to enable Remote Desktop and also to configure firewall exceptions.

## Resolution

The Firewall Service  startup type should be set to Automatic and the status should be  Started  when installing the Remote Desktop Services role.
