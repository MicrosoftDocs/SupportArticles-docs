## Remote Desktop clients (mstsc.exe)

- **RDP 8.1 updates for Windows 7**

    These fixes update the Remote Desktop Services server-side roles and components that are built around Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 8.1. However, although updates are performed on the server-side infrastructure, the Remote Desktop Clients are often left untouched. This can cause performance and reliability issues. By default, older clients such as Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (SP1) are restricted to RDP 7.1 and do not provide the new features and improvements that are available in RDP 8.1. Therefore, we have released the RDP 8.1 client for Windows 7 to provide significant performance and reliability improvements when these clients are connected to RDS 2012 R2 environments. To enable RDP 8.1 on Windows 7, follow these steps:

    1. Verify which version of RDP you're using. To do this, start the Remote Desktop Connection client program (mstsc.exe), click the small Remote Desktop icon in the top-left corner of the application dialog box, and then select **About**. Verify that the **About** message indicates _Remote Desktop Protocol 8.1 supported_.

        :::image type="content" source="media/remote-desktop-services-updates/verify-rdp-version.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the About Remote Desktop Connection window, which shows Remote Desktop Protocol 8.1 supported.":::

    2. If the About message indicates Remote Desktop Protocol 7.1 supported, install the following updates for RDP 8.1:

        - [2574819](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2574819): An update is available that adds support for DTLS in Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1

        - [2857650](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2857650): Update that improves the RemoteApp and Desktop Connections features is available for Windows 7

        - [2830477](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2830477): Update for RemoteApp and Desktop Connections feature is available for Windows

        - [2913751](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2913751): Smart card redirection in remote sessions fails in a Windows 7 SP1-based RDP 8.1 client

        - [2923545](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2923545): Update for RDP 8.1 is available for Windows 7 SP1.31255

    3. [3125574](https://support.microsoft.com/help/3125574): Convenience rollup update for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
