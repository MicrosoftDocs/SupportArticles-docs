# Remote Desktop IP Virtualization in Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2022

This article discusses about Remote Desktop IP Virtualization in Windows Server.

> [!NOTE]
> Remote Desktop IP Virtualization on Windows Server is only supported in on-premises environments.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4501072

## How to use IP virtualization

To use IP virtualization, follow these steps:

1. Start an elevated PowerShell window, and run the following cmdlet to rename the registry key:

   ```powershell
   Rename-Item HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\AppId_Catalog\2C69D9F1 Backup_2C69D9F1
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > Deleting the key has the same effects, but the rename provides a way to revert back more easily if desired. The following is the default values:
   >
   > `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\AppId_Catalog\2C69D9F1\`
   > **AppFullPath**: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe\
   > **PermittedLspCategories**: 0x40000000

2. Restart the computer.
3. Enable the IP Virtualization feature. To do so, open **gpedit.msc**, go to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Remote Desktop Services** > **Remote Desktop Session Host** > **Application Compatibility**, and then enable the **Turn on Remote Desktop IP Virtualization** policy.

4. Restart the computer.

## More information

Remote Desktop IP Virtualization was introduced in Windows Server 2008 R2. In Windows Server 2008, Terminal Server had a single IP address that was shared among all remote desktop users. This made the remote desktop experience different from that of regular desktops, and it introduced some application compatibility problems.

In Windows Server 2008 R2, Remote Desktop Session Host server, formerly known as Terminal Server, supported per-session and per-program Remote Desktop IP Virtualization for Winsock applications. This support was provided by assigning individual IP addresses to user sessions to avoid application incompatibility issues by simulating a single user desktop. This method continues to be used in the current version of Windows Server.
