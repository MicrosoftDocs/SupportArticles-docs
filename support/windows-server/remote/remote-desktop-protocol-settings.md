## Introduction

When you use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to a remote computer, the Default.rdp file is created on the client computer. This article discusses the connection settings that are stored in the Default.rdp file.

## More information

When you use RDP to connect to a remote computer, you can use the Remote Desktop Connection **Options** dialog box to configure many of the connection settings. To configure these settings, follow these steps:  

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type _mstsc.exe_, and then click **OK**.
2. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** dialog box, click **Options**.

You can save *.rdp files with different settings if you connect to multiple remote computers. To save a new configuration, click **Save As** on the **General** tab in **Options**.
