_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 186555

## Error 2200

> This workstation is already logged on to the local-area network.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. A user is already logged on at this workstation.

Action: To see who is currently logged on at the workstation, type `NET CONFIG WORKSTATION`.

## Error 2201

> The workstation is not logged on to the local-area network.

## Error 2202

> The user name or group name parameter is invalid.

Explanation: You specified an invalid user name or group name.

Action: Use a different user name or group name.

## Error 2203

> The password parameter is invalid.

Explanation: You specified an invalid password.

Action: Use a valid password.

## Error 2204

> The logon processor did not add the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. Your user name wasn't added as a new message alias for one of the following reasons:

- The Messenger service isn't started on your workstation.
- Your user name and your workstation's computer name are the same, and your workstation's computer name is already a message alias.
- Your user name is in use as a message alias on another computer on the network. In this case, you can't receive messages at the local workstation using this name.

Action: Start the Messenger service on your workstation if it's not already started. Then use the `NET NAME` command to add your user name as a message alias. If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer, delete the alias on that computer. Then use the `NET NAME` command to add your user name as a message alias on this computer.

## Error 2205

> The logon processor did not add the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. Your user name is already established as a message alias. Either your user name and computer name are the same, or your user name is in use as a message alias on another computer on the network. If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer, you can't receive messages at the local workstation using this name.

Action: If your user name is being used as a message alias on another computer, delete the alias on that computer. Then log on again at this computer.

## Error 2206

> The logoff processor did not delete the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The message alias corresponding to your user name wasn't deleted. Either your user name is the same as the computer name, or your user name is being used as a message alias on some other network computer.

Action: No action is needed.

## Error 2207

> The logoff processor did not delete the message alias.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. The message alias corresponding to your user name wasn't deleted because your user name is the same as the computer name.

Action: No action is needed.

## Error 2208

Error 2208 isn't a valid error message.

## Error 2209

> Network logons are paused.

Action: The administrator must continue the Netlogon service by typing the command `NET CONTINUE NETLOGON`.

## Error 2210

> A centralized logon-server conflict occurred.

Explanation: You can't start the Netlogon service on this server because a server in the domain with an earlier version the software is running the Netlogon service.

Action: Before you can start the Netlogon service on this server, you must stop the Netlogon service on all servers in the domain running earlier versions of the software.

## Error 2211

> The server is configured without a valid user path.

## Error 2212

> An error occurred while loading or running the logon script.

Action: No action is needed.

## Error 2215

> The logon server could not be found.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. No domain controller is responding to your command.

Action: See your network administrator.

## Error 2216

> There is already a logon domain for this computer.

Explanation: This message should occur only on a down-level computer. Any action to correct the problem should be performed on that computer. This workstation already has a logon domain established.

Action: To log on in a different domain, you must first log off from the current domain and then log on again to a different domain.
