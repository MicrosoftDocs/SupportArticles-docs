# Virus alert about the Blaster worm and its variants

This article describes virus alert about the Blaster worm and its variants and contains information about how to prevent and recover from an infection from the Blaster worm and its variants.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows 10 - all editions, Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 826955

## Summary

On August 11, 2003, Microsoft began investigating a worm that was reported by Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS), and the Microsoft PSS Security Team issued an alert to inform customers about the new worm. A worm is a type of computer virus that generally spreads without user action and that distributes complete copies (possibly modified) of itself across networks (such as the Internet). Known as "Blaster," this new worm exploits the vulnerability that was addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-026 (823980) to spread itself over networks by using open Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ports on computers that are running any of the products that are listed at the beginning of this article.

This article contains information for network administrators and IT professionals about how to prevent and how to recover from an infection from the Blaster worm and its variants. The worm and its variants are also known as W32.Blaster.Worm, W32.Blaster.C.Worm, W32.Blaster.B.Worm, W32.Randex.E (Symantec), W32/Lovsan.worm (McAfee), WORM_MSBLAST.A (Trendmicro), and Win32.Posa.Worm (Computer Associates). For additional information about recovering from this worm, contact your antivirus software vendor.

    > Repeat step 2 for each of these file names: Msblast.exe, Nstask32.exe, Penis32.exe, Teekids.exe, Winlogin.exe, Win32sockdrv.dll, and Yuetyutr.dll. If you find any of these files, your computer may be infected with the worm. If you find one of these files, delete the file, and then follow the steps in the "Recovery" section of this article. To delete the file, type `del %systemroot%\system32\filename.ext /a` at the command prompt, and then press ENTER.

## Prevention

To prevent this virus from infecting your computer, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the Internet Connection Firewall feature (ICF) in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and in Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or use Basic Firewall, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000, or a third-party firewall to block TCP ports 135, 139, 445, and 593; UDP ports 69 (TFTP), 135, 137, and 138; and TCP port 4444 for remote command shell.

    To turn on the ICF in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, follow these steps:

    1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
    2. In **Control Panel**, double-click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.
    3. Right-click the connection where you want to turn on Internet Connection Firewall, and then click **Properties**.
    4. Click the **Advanced** tab, and then click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some dial-up connections may not appear in the Network Connection folders. For example, AOL and MSN dial-up connections may not appear. In some cases, you can use the following steps to turn on ICF for a connection that does not appear in the Network Connection folder. If these steps do not work, contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for information about how to firewall your Internet connection.

    1. Start **Internet Explorer**.
    2. On the **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
    3. Click the **Connections** tab, click the dial-up connection that you use to connect to the Internet, and then click **Settings**.

    [283673](https://support.microsoft.com/help/283673) How to turn on or turn off the firewall in Windows XP  

    > [!NOTE]
    > ICF is only available on Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition. Basic Firewall is a component of Routing and Remote Access that you can enable for any public interface on a computer that is running both Routing and Remote Access and a member of the Windows Server 2003 family.

2. This worm uses a previously announced vulnerability as part of its infection method. Because of this, you must make sure that you have installed the 823980 security patch on all your computers to address the vulnerability that is identified in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-026. The 824146 security patch replaces the 823980 security patch. Microsoft recommends that you install the 824146 security patch that also includes fixes for the issues that are addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS03-026 (823980).

3. Use the latest virus-detection signature from your antivirus vendor to detect new viruses and their variants.

## Recovery

Best practices for security suggest that you perform a complete "clean" installation on a previously compromised computer to remove any undiscovered exploits that can lead to a future compromise. For additional information, visit the following Cert Advisory Web site:

[Steps for Recovering from a UNIX or NT System Compromise](https://www.cert.org/tech_tips/win-unix-system_compromise.html).

However, many antivirus companies have written tools to remove the known exploit that is associated with this particular worm. To download the removal tool from your antivirus vendor, use the following procedures depending on your operating system.

### Recovery for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition

1. Turn on the Internet Connection Firewall feature (ICF) in Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition, and Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; or use Basic Firewall, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server 2000, or a third-party firewall.

    To turn on ICF, follow these steps:

    1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**.
    2. In **Control Panel**, double-click **Networking and Internet Connections**, and then click **Network Connections**.

    4. Click the **Advanced** tab, and then click to select the **Protect my computer or network by limiting or preventing access to this computer from the Internet** check box.

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - If your computer shuts down or restarts repeatedly when you try to follow these steps, disconnect from the Internet before you turn on your firewall. If you connect to the Internet over a broadband connection, locate the cable that runs from your external DSL or cable modem, and then unplug that cable either from the modem or from the telephone jack. If you use a dial-up connection, locate the telephone cable that runs from the modem inside your computer to your telephone jack, and then unplug that cable either from the telephone jack or from your computer. If you cannot disconnect from the Internet, type the following line at the command prompt to configure RPCSS not to restart your computer when the service fails: `sc failure rpcss reset= 0 actions= restart`.
    >
    >    To reset RPCSS to default recovery setting after you complete these steps, type the following line at the command prompt: `sc failure rpcss reset= 0 actions= reboot/60000`.
    >
    > - If you have more than one computer sharing an Internet connection, use a firewall only on the computer that is directly connected to the Internet. Do not use a firewall on the other computers that share the Internet connection. If you are running Windows XP, use the Network Setup Wizard to turn on ICF.
    > - Using a firewall should not affect your e-mail service or Web browsing, but a firewall can disable some Internet software, services, or features. If this behavior occurs, you may have to open some ports on your firewall for some Internet feature to work. See the documentation that is included with the Internet service that is not working to determine which ports you must open. See the documentation that is included with your firewall to determine how to open these ports.
