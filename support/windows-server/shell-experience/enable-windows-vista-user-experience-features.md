### Sleep

Windows Server 2008 supports the sleep feature. However, this feature depends on the following conditions:

- Drivers that support sleep

    > [!NOTE]

To enable sleep in Windows Server 2008, follow these steps:

1. Click **Start**, click **Control Panel**, and then double-click **Power Options**.
2. Under the power plan that is configured, click **Change plan settings**, and then click **Change advanced power settings**.
3. Expand **Sleep**, and then modify the sleep configuration settings as appropriate for your requirements.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If **Sleep** does not appear on the **Advanced Settings** tab of the **Power Options** dialog box, the computer does not meet the requirements to support the sleep feature. In this scenario, you may have to update the drivers or the devices on the computer.
