# Scripts: Retrieve profile age and optionally delete aged copies

This article provides a script to retrieve profile age and optionally delete aged copies.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2016 and later versions, Windows 11, Windows 10

There's a Group Policy "[Delete user profiles older than a specified number of days on system restart](https://gpsearch.azurewebsites.net/#2583)" to delete aged copies of user profiles.

A timestamp stored in the registry has been used since Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and later versions. This is more reliable than the approach in older operating system (OS) versions using the New Technology File System (NTFS) timestamp of the profile *NTUSER.DAT* file, as this file may be updated by any software loading the user registry.

This script allows you to test-drive what the policy will do or run it with different parameters. For example, you can clean up the profiles with a lower unused interval. The script will only clean up profiles that aren't loaded when the script runs.

[!INCLUDE [Script disclaimer](../../includes/script-disclaimer.md)]

> [!Important]
> Remote execution using registry information requires Windows Remote Management (WinRM) to be allowed on the target computer.

```PowerShell
###############################################################################
#
# Usage:
#	Powershell -file ADDelProf.ps1 [-Days #] [-UserDomain <domainname>] [-UserName <username>] [-RoamingOnly] [-UseNtfs] [-Delete] [-Quiet] [-ComputerName]
#
#	-Days = Number of days a profile has not been used to consider for deletion (default 0)
#	-UserDomain = Domain pattern to match to consider for deletion (default "*")
#	-UserName = Username pattern to match to consider for deletion (default "*")
#	-RoamingOnly = Determines if only profiles that would be roaming should be deleted. Default is to do all unloaded profiles.
#	-UseNtfs = Determines if using reg-entries or NTFS timestamp on ntuser.dat. Default is registry.
#	-Delete = Determines if profiles will be deleted or reported. Default is to just report.
#	-Quiet = Prompts or not, default is to prompt.
#	-ComputerName = Computer to delete profiles against. Default is the local machine. Needs WinRM to work so we can invoke registry read remotely.
#
#	Example:
#	To delete profiles that haven't been used in 60 or more days on the local machine
#   Powershell -file ADDelProf.ps1 -Days 60 -Delete True
