# Scheduled task may not run upon reboot if the machine is off at the time of task

This article helps solve an issue where a scheduled task may not run upon reboot if the machine is off at the time of the task.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 7 Service Pack 1  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2437520

## Symptoms

On a Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, a scheduled task may not run upon reboot if the machine was off at the time of the scheduled task.

## Cause

This issue can occur if the task trigger was set to run One Time when created. It is possible to set a task to "Run as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed". This will cause the task to rerun after a reboot if the trigger was missed. However, this does not occur if the task is set to run One Time. This behavior is by design.

## Resolution

You can work around this issue by setting a time and date under the **Expire** option of the task. This option can be reached by opening the **Properties** of the task, selecting the **Triggers** tab, and then clicking the **Edit** button for the trigger in question. If a date and time are set for the **Expire** option, the task will attempt to refire on reboot if its previous trigger time was missed.
