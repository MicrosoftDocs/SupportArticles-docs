# Troubleshoot WMI high CPU usage issues

This article covers how to diagnose Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) high CPU usage issues on any Windows operating system.

## Identify the problem

In most scenarios, the CPU is consumed by the *WmiPrvse.exe* process, and there are a few instances where *svchost.exe* hosting the WMI service (Winmgmt) is consuming high CPU usage.

### Review the Task Manager's Processes pane or Details pane to identify the exact process

Identify if the process is *WmiPrvse.exe* or *svchost.exe* (hosting the WMI service Winmgmt), and identify the process ID.

> [!NOTE]
> You may have to manually add the **PID** column to view the process ID of all the processes in Task Manager.

Here's an example. Go to **Task Manager** > **Details**, then sort by **Name** and locate the *WmiPrvse.exe* process that's consuming high CPU usage. Make a note of the process ID (PID).

This screenshot shows multiple instances of **WMI Provider Host** (the *WmiPrvse.exe* process) as active and its CPU utilization.

This screenshot shows Services Host: Windows Management Instrumentation (*svchost.exe* hosting the Winmgmt service) and its CPU utilization.

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/task-manager-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the details via task manager.":::

Go to **Task Manager** > **Services**, sort by **Name**, and locate the Winmgmt service. Make a note of the PID. Right-click the service and select **Go to details** to locate the *svchost.exe* process as follows:

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/task-manager-services.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the services via task manager.":::

In the example, out of three *WmiPrvse.exe* instances, PID 3648 is located, which consumes around 25% of CPU usage. Winmgmt is hosted under the *svchost.exe* process with PID 2752.

### Understand the CPU consumption

This involves mainly observing the overall CPU consumption and the PID identified. It's important to note when, how, and the frequency of the CPU consumption.

Assess the situation by understanding if the CPU consumption is high during a specific time. Check if there's any activity, such as running specific tasks or services active, running monitoring applications, or running scripts leading to *WmiPrvse.exe* or Winmgmt high CPU.

Understand if there's any pattern, which means CPU usage is consistent, inconsistent, random, sporadic, or has regular spikes.

Identify the frequency of the CPU consumption. Check if it occurs only during production hours, out-of-business hours, or a random time of the day. It may also occur during a specific activity like user sign in or sign out.
  
You may use Task Manager and visually make a note of how the CPU usage pattern is.

Here's an example that shows how to use the Performance Monitor (Perfmon) tool to identify the exact instances of *WmiPrvse.exe* with the PID you identified. You can also get a graphical view of the CPU consumption of any process (*WmiPrvse.exe* or *svchost.exe* hosting WMI service).

1. Open an elevated command prompt, and enter *Perfmon*.
2. Select **Performance Monitor** in the left pane, and select the plus sign (**+**) in the right pane to open the **Add Counters** window.
3. Expand **Process** and select **ID Process**. Select all the **WmiPrvse#** instances, and then select **Add** > **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/id-process-counter.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add ID Process counters.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/id-process-counter-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the details of the ID Process counters.":::

4. In the **Add Counters** window, expand **Process** and select **%Processor Time**. Select the **WmiPrvse#** matching the PID consuming high CPU usage, and then select **Add** > **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/processor-time-counter.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows how to add %Processor Time counters.":::

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/processor-time-counter-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the details of the %Processor Time counters.":::

5. For the "ID Process" counter, the **Last**, **Average**, **Minimum**, and **Maximum** all represent the PID of the respective *WmiPrvse.exe* process. Once you have identified the exact instance that's consuming high CPU usage, you may remove the remaining instances of **WmiPrvse#** instances from the list by pressing <kbd>Delete</kbd>.

In the example, it's noted that *WmiPrvse.exe* PID 556 was consuming high CPU usage, and it's **WmiPrvse#1** that matches PID 556 in Performance Monitor.

Then counter **%Processor Time** of **WmiPrvse#1** is added to see a live graphical view of the CPU usage of this process. In the example, the **%Processor Time** color of **WmiPrvse#1** is changed from yellow to red.

The steps are the same for locating the right **svchost#** in Performance Monitor in the case of high CPU usage by *svchost.exe* hosting the Wmimgmt service.

If you observe that a *svchost.exe* process hosting the WMI service is causing high CPU usage and suspect that WMI is contributing to the issue, you can confirm if the PID of the *svchost.exe* process is hosting the WMI service by running the following command:

```console
tasklist /svc /fi "Services eq Winmgmt"
```

If the *svchost.exe* process contains multiple services, you can break apart the WMI service into its own *svchost.exe* process by following these steps:

1. Open an elevated command prompt with elevated privileges.
2. Run the following command:

    ```console
    sc config Winmgmt type= own
    ```

3. Restart the WMI service.

After restarting the service, you may run the `Tasklist /svc` command to check if the Winmgmt service is running under its own *svchost.exe* process.

After resolving the issue or no longer requiring the service to be in its own *svchost.exe* process, you can place it back into the shared *svchost.exe* process. You can perform the action by running the following command from a command prompt and then restarting the WMI service again:

```console
sc config Winmgmt type= share
```

## Diagnose WmiPrvse.exe

So far, you only have the exact PID of *WmiPrvse.exe* that's consuming high CPU usage. Next, gather as much information as possible about this PID. This helps you assess the situation or identify something that could be causing the problem.  Gather information on other resource usage or identify the exact WMI provider (DLL) hosted by the *WmiPrvse.exe* PID identified.

### Other resource usage such as memory, handles, threads, and username

Gather information on other resource usage, such as memory, handles, threads, and username, at the time of high CPU usage. You may use the **Details** tab in Task Manager, select the exact PID, and review it.

> [!NOTE]
> Add additional columns as needed.

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/task-manager-high-cpu-usage-service.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the high CPU usage service in Task Manager.":::

### Identify the exact WMI provider (DLL) hosted by the WmiPrvse.exe PID identified

[Process Explorer](/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) can help you identify the exact providers hosted in the PID identified. Follow these steps:

1. Run Process Explorer as administrator. Locate the identified *WmiPrvse.exe* PID, go to its properties, and select the **WMI Providers** tab.
2. In the following example, *WmiPrvse.exe* PID 556 is located and found to be hosting:

    - WMI provider: `MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER`
    - Namespace: `root\CIMV2`
    - DLL path: *%systemroot%\system32\wbem\ntevt.dll*

    :::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/wmiprvse-pid-556.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the WmiPrvSE.exe:556 properties.":::

In most cases, there may be more than one provider loaded. It may be any of the providers that are spending time in the CPU, causing high CPU issues.

Sometimes, if the issue is intermittent or infrequent, the *WmiPrvse.exe* causing the issue may be terminated over time. When the issue occurs again, it may be the same provider(s) in a new *WmiPrvse.exe* instance. In this situation, once you have the provider(s) noted, run the following cmdlet to show the current PID of the *WmiPrvse.exe* process containing that provider:

```PowerShell
tasklist /m <Provider DLL>
```

Here's an example:

```PowerShell
tasklist /m ntevt.dll 
```

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/tasklist-output.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the tasklist output of the ntevt.dll file.":::

Hence, it's important to understand what providers are loaded in the *WmiPrvse.exe* process and make a note of the PID of the *WmiPrvse.exe* process every time.

Once you have the provider(s) that are loaded in the *WmiPrvse.exe* causing high CPU usage, you can understand if it's handling any tasks.

Tasks may be the incoming WMI queries that are submitted by the client process to the WMI service, which then is assigned to the appropriate WMI provider process. In the example, the task is submitted to the `MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER` provider. So the next step will be to study the incoming queries and tasks to the `MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER` provider.

## Analyze the incoming queries

Examining incoming queries involves:

- Identifying WMI query(s) that are handled by WMI providers causing high CPU usage.
- WMI class(es) queries.
- An associated user.
- A client process that's initiating the query.

The above information can be gathered using the publicly available tool [WMIMon](https://github.com/luctalpe/WMIMon) or WMI-Activity Operational logs and WMI-Tracing available under **Event Viewer**.

### Operational logs: Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational

The incoming queries are logged as operational events in the Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational log, which is available under:

**Event Viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Microsoft** > **Windows** > **WMI-Activity**

There are several types of events logged.

If the *WmiPrvse.exe* process consuming high CPU is terminated from time to time, and you already know what provider(s) are loaded, the following event may help determine the currently active *WmiPrvse.exe* process hosting the provider in question.

```output
Log Name:      Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational
Source:        Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity
Event ID:      5857
Task Category: None
User:          NETWORK SERVICE
Description:
MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER provider started with result code 0x0. HostProcess = wmiprvse.exe; ProcessID = 556; ProviderPath = %systemroot%\system32\wbem\ntevt.dll
```

### Enable "Analytic and Debug Logs" for enabling the WMI tracing

In **Event Viewer**, select **View** > **Show Analytic and Debug Logs** to enable the **Debug** and **Trace** for WMI-Activity.

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/event-viewer-operational.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows Operational in Event Viewer.":::

**Debug** and **Trace** are disabled by default, and each of them can be enabled manually by right-clicking **Trace** or **Debug** and then selecting **Enable Log**.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling **Show Analytic and Debug Logs** enables debug and tracing for almost all the event sources and creates additional logging. Hence this has to be disabled once the investigation is complete and will not be in use anymore.

This tracing can be kept enabled while you observe high CPU consumption by the *WmiPrvse.exe* process or long enough to capture the behavior of high CPU usage to keep the logs clean and moderately sized for easier analyzing of traces.

1. Export the traces by right-clicking **Trace** and selecting **Save All Events As…**.
2. Select `.xml` or `.csv` in **Save as type**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You may choose other familiar formats such as `.EVTX` as needed.

3. Choose the desired language of the tracing file.
4. You may choose to save the WMI-Activity Operational events separately as well, in the desired format for you to review and analyze.

### Review the WMI trace files

Within the WMI tracing, there are multiple important operations included, which are all part of incoming WMI queries. The operations are documented in [IWbemServices interface (wbemcli.h)](/windows/win32/api/wbemcli/nn-wbemcli-iwbemservices).

Some of the important operations are:

- `IWbemServices::ExecQuery` method (wbemcli.h)
- `IWbemServices::ExecMethod` method (wbemcli.h)
- `IWbemServices::ExecQueryAsync` method (wbemcli.h)

Here's one of the log entries from the WMI-Tracing CSV file saved:

|Level|Date and time|Source|Event ID|Task category|Description|

From the operation output of the second example, you can get and understand the following information:

- Operation CreateInstanceEnum is initiated on behalf of the user with SID: UserID="S-1-5-21-0000000000-0000000000-00000000-1103"
- On 2023-05-05 at 13:09
- Exact operation: `Provider::CreateInstanceEnum - MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER : Win32_NTLogEvent`
- Host ID: 556
- Provider name: `MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER`
- Provider path: *%systemroot%\system32\wbem\ntevt.dll*

## Find the client PIDs that causing high CPU usage

The idea of reviewing this log file is to list the operations associated with the identified *WmiPrvse.exe* PID that's consuming high CPU usage, understand the incoming queries, and who's initiating them (the client process).

In the example covered above, it's the PID 552 that is causing high CPU usage.

From the second example of the log output, the operation [CreateInstanceEnum](/windows/win32/api/wbemcli/nf-wbemcli-iwbemservices-createinstanceenum) is initiated for specific WMI class `Win32_NTLogEvent`.

For more information, see [Win32_NTLogEvent](/previous-versions/windows/desktop/eventlogprov/win32-ntlogevent#requirements), which includes the WMI provider details that are associated with the WMI class.

You now know the exact WMI provider hosted (`MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER`) in the *WmiPrvse.exe* that's causing high CPU usage, the host ID (552), and WMI class (Win32_NTLogEvent) that's being queried by some client process.

Depending on the tool that you're using to review the trace files, you may apply necessary filters to review just the operations related to `Win32_NTLogEvent` or *WmiPrvse.exe* PID 552 or Host ID 552 or *ntevt.dll*.

With the filter showing only the lines or operations that include "Win32_NTLogEvent", the results are:

|Level|Source|Event ID|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|Information|Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity|11|CorrelationId = {345E5566-0000-0000-0000-68343241D901}; GroupOperationId = 30641; OperationId = 30642; Operation = Start IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum - root\cimv2 : Win32_NTLogEvent; ClientMachine = 21H2W10M; User = CONTOSO\\\<UserName>; ClientProcessId = 5484; NamespaceName = 133277000000783520|
|Information|Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity|12|ProviderInfo for GroupOperationId = 30641; Operation = Provider::CreateInstanceEnum - MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER : Win32_NTLogEvent; HostID = 556; ProviderName = MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER; ProviderGuid = {FD4F53E0-65DC-11d1-AB64-00C04FD9159E}; Path = %systemroot%\system32\wbem\ntevt.dll|
|Information|Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity|11|CorrelationId = {345E5566-0000-0000-0000-68343241D901}; GroupOperationId = 30697; OperationId = 30698; Operation = Start IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum - root\cimv2 : Win32_NTLogEvent; ClientMachine = 21H2W10M; User = CONTOSO\\\<UserName>; ClientProcessId = 5484; NamespaceName = 133277000000783520|
|Information|Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity|12|ProviderInfo for GroupOperationId = 30697; Operation = Provider::CreateInstanceEnum - MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER : Win32_NTLogEvent; HostID = 556; ProviderName = MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER; ProviderGuid = {FD4F53E0-65DC-11d1-AB64-00C04FD9159E}; Path = %systemroot%\system32\wbem\ntevt.dll|

From the above operations, you can get the following additional information:

- Timestamp
- Operation ID: 30642;
- The exact operation = `Start IWbemServices::CreateInstanceEnum - root\cimv2 : Win32_NTLogEvent`;
- Client Machine = 21H2W10M
- User = CONTOSO\\\<UserName>
- PID of Client that has initiated the query: 5484

At last, you have the PID of a client process 5484, that's initiating a query to `Win32_NTLogEvent`. That's handled by provider `MS_NT_EVENTLOG_PROVIDER` and hosted under *WmiPrvse.exe* PID 552, which causes high CPU usage.

Once you have narrowed down the client PIDs, use one of the following tools to find the process name.
  
- [Task Manager](/shows/inside/task-manager)
- [Process Explorer](/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer)
- [Process Monitor](/sysinternals/downloads/procmon)
- [WMIMon](https://github.com/luctalpe/WMIMon)

### More information on WmiMon

*WMImon.exe* is a powerful monitoring tool that allows for the tracking and monitoring of system events and the resource usage of the WMI service.

It serves the important function of identifying the WMI calls and queries made by other processes, as well as providing information on query frequency, the user account used for the queries, and the requested information.

This data can be useful for system administrators who need to troubleshoot performance issues.

To collect and analyze this data, you can follow the step-by-step instructions:

1. Identify the PID of the *WmiPrvSE.exe* that's consuming the CPU usage using the methods described above.
2. Download the *WMIMon.exe* tool from [GitHub - luctalpe/WMIMon](https://github.com/luctalpe/WMIMon). The tool is to monitor WMI activity on Windows.
3. Extract the contents of the *WMIMon_Binaries.zip* file to a folder on your computer.
4. Open a command prompt as an administrator and go to the folder where you extracted the WMIMon files.
5. Execute the *WMIMon.exe* file by entering `WMIMon.exe` in the command prompt and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
6. WMIMon will now start monitoring the WMI calls made by processes on the system, including the one identified in step 1.
7. WMIMon displays information such as the client process ID, the WMI namespace called by the operation, the WMI class name, and the user account used to make the request.
8. Analyze the output from WMIMon to identify which process(es) is making frequent WMI calls and potentially causing high CPU usage.

By following these steps, you can effectively use *WMIMon.exe* to monitor WMI activity on your system and identify any performance or security issues caused by excessive WMI usage.

Here's an example:

:::image type="content" source="media/troubleshoot-wmi-high-cpu-issues/wmimon-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the data captured by WMIMon.":::

> [!NOTE]
> You can export the data captured by WMIMon to a text file by executing the `WMIMon.exe > Data.txt` command in the command prompt. To stop the data capture, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>.

There may be tricky situations where narrowing down a specific client PID, application, or EXE is impossible. In such cases, considering a common entity such as a user name or machine associated may be useful.

That is, understand if the user initiating the query is a service account or associated with a specific application.

### Other solutions

Once you finalize the suspect, you may consider temporarily disabling its service or uninstalling the application associated with it and checking if the high CPU usage issue gets solved.

Here are some scenarios where disabling it can validate your observations.

- Monitoring applications and services
- System center configuration manager (SCCM) (*policyhost.exe* or *Monitoringhost.exe*)
- *Powershell.exe* running scripts containing WMI queries

## Data collection

If you need assistance from Microsoft support, we recommend you collect the information by following the steps mentioned in [Gather information by using TSS for User Experience issues](../../windows-client/windows-troubleshooters/gather-information-using-tss-user-experience.md#wmi).

You can also gather information by using the WMI-Collect tool. Here are the steps:

1. Download [WMI-Collect.zip](https://aka.ms/WMI-Collect) and extract it in a folder, such as *C:\\temp*.
2. From an elevated PowerShell command prompt, run the *WMI-Collect.ps1* script from the folder where the script is saved. For example:

    ```PowerShell
    C:\temp\WMI-Collect.ps1 -Logs -Trace -Activity -Kernel -WPR -PerfMonWMIPrvSE
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Keep the PowerShell command prompt open with the "Press ENTER to stop the capture:" message, and make sure the *WmiPrvse.exe* process or the WMI service high CPU usage issue is reproduced.
    > - Don't keep the tracing enabled for more than one minute.

3. Stop the tracing by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

The script will create a subfolder containing the results of all traces and the diagnostic information. Compress the folder. After a support case is created, this file can be uploaded to the secure workspace for analysis.
