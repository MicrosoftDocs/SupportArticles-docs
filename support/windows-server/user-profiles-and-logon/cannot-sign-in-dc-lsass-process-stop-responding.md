# Can't sign in to a domain controller, and the LSASS process stops responding

This article helps fix the issue in which you can't sign in to a domain controller, and the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process stops responding.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3144809

You can't sign in to a domain controller after reboot, and you experience the following scenarios:

- You can type the username and password in the sign-in screen, but when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>, nothing happens.
- The sign-in doesn't proceed without errors.
- If you disconnect the network interface card (NIC), you can sign in with cached credentials.
- The LSASS process stops responding or has stopped responding recently.
- Many services can't start due to a sign-in failure.

When this issue occurs, the system event log may contain one or more of the following events:

|Event log  |Event source  |ID  |Message text  |

## The Password Settings Container is moved or missing

In Windows Server 2012 and later versions, the authentication process makes a function call to determine fine-grained password policies, and it looks for the Password Settings Container. If it isn't present under *cn=system,dc=\<domain\>,dc=\<com\>* in the Active Directory domain naming context, or it's in an incorrect location, the sign-in fails.

> [!NOTE]
> The Password Settings Container is a default system container that should always be present. This container is created as part of Adprep for Windows Server 2008 and later versions' domain controllers to support [fine-grained password policies](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc770394(v=ws.10)).

## Move the container to the correct location or rerun Adprep

If the Password Settings Container is in the incorrect location, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to search for the container:

    ```console
    repadmin /showattr . ncobj:domain: /filter:"(objectclass=msds-PasswordSettingsContainer)" /subtree
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can run the `repadmin /showobj` command to check when the container was last modified.
2. Open the LDP tool and select **Browse** > **Modify RDN** to move the object to the correct location under the system container.

If the Password Settings Container doesn't exist, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Infrastructure master as a domain admin.
2. Create a .txt file with the following text:

    ```output
    dn: CN=ActiveDirectoryUpdate,CN=DomainUpdates,CN=System,DC=contoso,dc=com
    changetype: modify
    replace: revision
    revision: 1
    ```

3. Open an elevated command prompt, and run the `ldifde` command to import the file.

    ```console
    ldifde -i -f <File Name>
    ```

4. In the LDP tool or the Active Directory Service Interface (ADSI) Editor tool, delete the containers of the operations you need to rerun. For example:

    cn=71482d49-8870-4cb3-a438-b6fc9ec35d70,cn=Operations,cn=DomainUpdates,cn=System,DC=fia,DC=local.
5. Run the `adprep /domainprep` command.

You can check the *ADPrep.log* file (*C:\\Windows\\debug\\adprep\\logs\\\<Date Time\>\\ADPrep.log*) to verify the result.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Server 2019 and later versions have an update that prevents the LSASS process from stopping responding.
