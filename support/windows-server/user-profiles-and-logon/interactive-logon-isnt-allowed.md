# Domain Controller doesn't allow interactive logon, shows an error: The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship

This article provides a solution to an error that occurs when Domain Controller does not allow interactive logon.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2015518

## Symptoms

After rebooting, a Windows Server 2012 R2 DC cannot be logged on to anymore. You see this with both a console logon or terminal services/remote desktop. The error shown is:

> The security database on the server does not have a computer account for this workstation trust relationship

If you restart the computer in Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) and examine the **System** event log, you see:

> Log Name:      System

ADDITIONAL DATA  
If this computer is a member of or a Domain Controller in the specified domain, the aforementioned account is a computer account for this computer in the specified domain. Otherwise, the account is an interdomain trust account with the specified domain.

You may also see a KDC 11 error for a duplicate SPN in the **System** event log:

> Log Name:      System  
Source:        Microsoft-Windows-Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center  
Date:          *\<DateTime>*  
Event ID:      11  
Task Category: None  
Level:         Error  
Keywords:      Classic  
User:          N/A  
Computer:      *\<ComputerName>*  
Description:  
The KDC encountered duplicate names while processing a Kerberos authentication request. The duplicate name is host/2008spn-02.adatum.com (of type DS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_NAME). This may result in authentication failures or downgrades to NTLM. In order to prevent this from occurring remove the duplicate entries for host/2008spn-02.adatum.com in Active Directory.

## Cause

The DCs Service Principle Name (SPN) has been duplicated and now exists as an attribute on both the DC as well as some other user or computer.

## Resolution

Locate the duplicate SPN and remove it. This value can be found with SETSPN.EXE or LDIFDE.EXE. In this example, the duplicate name is 2008r2spn-02.

- `setspn.exe -x`
- `setspn.exe -q 2008r2spn-02*`
- `ldifde.exe -f spn.txt -d -l serviceprincipalname -r "(serviceprincipalname=*2008r2spn-02*)" -p subtree`

## More information

This behavior differs from Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000. Those operating systems don't get the same errors and can still be logged into with duplicate DC SPNs. Starting in Windows Vista, failback to NTLM is disallowed with interactive logons - this is a security feature to prevent an attacker from somehow damaging Kerberos, thereby forcing a less secure protocol to be used.

In order to update an SPN on a user or computer, a user must be a member of Administrators, Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or have been granted permissions to modify the servicePrincipalName attribute on a user or computer. No standard user can modify SPN's - not even on themselves or computers they added to the domain. Only high privilege users can create this outage scenario.
