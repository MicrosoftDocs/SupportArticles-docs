> DETAIL - The filename or extension is too long.  

## Cause

This can happen if the destination path of the user's profile is on a server with a long name and share folder name. For example, \\\\servername\\thisistheprofileshare. As the file is stored locally on c:\\users\\username, the filename for copying to the destination will increase when this prefix is changed to \\\\servername\\thisistheprofileshare\\ leading to a pathname longer than the supported 260 chars.

## Resolution

Use one of the following methods to resolve the issue:

1. You can use the "Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed" option in Internet Explorer to delete all cached Internet files when a user quits Internet Explorer. This option doesn't delete cookie information. Cookie information (which is usually small) is copied when the profile is saved. To use this option, follow these steps:

    1. In **Internet Explorer**, click **Internet Options** on the **View** (or **Tools**) menu.

    2. Click the **Advanced** tab.

    3. Under **Security**, click the **Delete saved pages when browser closed** or **Empty Temporary Internet Files folder when browser is closed** check box to select it.

    4. Click **OK**.

2. Enable the Group Policy Setting for "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles", located under in the following location:
