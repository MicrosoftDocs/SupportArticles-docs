# Copy-and-paste operations don't work when you connect to a Hyper-V virtual machine by using VMConnect Enhanced Session Mode

This article provides a solution to an issue where copy-and-paste operations may not work as expected when you connect to a Hyper-V virtual machine by using VMConnect Enhanced Session Mode.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 10 - all editions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4090037

## Symptoms

You can't copy and paste files between a system that is running [Virtual Machine Connection (VMConnect.exe)](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/learn-more/hyper-v-virtual-machine-connect) and a Hyper-V guest virtual machine when you use Enhanced Session Mode through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Cause

Enhanced Session Mode enables the transfer of files to and from virtual machines through the Clipboard copy-and-paste operations. However, copying and pasting files through the Clipboard is disabled if the **Do not allow drive redirection policy** option is enabled.

## Resolution

To successfully copy files to and from Hyper-V virtual machines when you use VMConnect through Enhanced Session Mode, make sure that you don't enable the following policy:

- Policy path: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Terminal Services\\Terminal Server\\Device and Resource Redirection

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you use the Local Group Policy Editor, the Policies folder is not part of the node path.

- Policy setting: Do not allow drive redirection

    Set this policy to "Disabled" or "Not Configured" to allow file copy redirection in Remote Desktop Services and Hyper-V Enhanced Session Mode sessions.
