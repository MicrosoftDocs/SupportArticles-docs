# Event ID 4096 (Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Integration-KvpExchange) is logged

This article discusses that Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Integration-KvpExchange is logged on a Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V host.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2989430

## Symptoms

On a Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V host, the following Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Integration-KVPExchange event ID 4096 is logged:

> Log Name : Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Integration/Admin  
Source: Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-Integration-KvpExchange  
Event ID: 4096  
Level: Error  
Message: 'VM Name': The Data Exchange integration service is either not enabled, not running or not initialized. (Virtual machine ID \<VM GUID>)

## Cause

This Error event may be logged when a virtual machine (VM) saves, starts, or stops, and there is a concurrent request to retrieve a KVP item, such as the IP address or the system version.

## More information

Although this event is logged, the error causes no harm to the Hyper-V host. Typically, event ID 4096 is not logged regularly. Therefore, you can safely ignore it because KVP items can be retrieved after a VM starts. If you do see this event logged regularly, it may indicate another problem. In that, we recommend that you contact [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/contactus).
