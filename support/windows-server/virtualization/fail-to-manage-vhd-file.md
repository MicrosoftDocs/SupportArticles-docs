## Cause

There is a timing issue with FSDepends.sys and with VHDMP.sys. This timing issue occurs when certain backup programs are installed on Windows Server computers. By default, the FSDepends.sys start value in the registry is set to **Manual**. When any third-party backup software loads its tape device driver, the software can sometimes result in FSDepends.sys and VHDMP.sys not initializing correctly.  

## Resolution  

To work around these problems, FSDepends.sys should be set to a start value of Boot (0x0).  

Make sure that you back up the registry before you change it. Also make sure that you know how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.  

For more information about how to back up, restore, and change the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:  
[322756](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows

To work around these problems, follow these steps:  

1. Start Registry Editor.
2. Locate the following registry key:  
 `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\FsDepends`  

3. Under the "FsDepends" key, change REG_DWORD value "Start" from **3** to **0**.
4. Restart the computer.  

## More information

As soon as the computer is restarted, FSDepends.sys starts immediately and the timing issue no longer occurs.  
Or, you can try one of the following two workarounds. **Neither of these methods is recommended.** However, they work to correct the problems if editing the registry is not possible or desirable:  

- Turn off any attached tape device and restart the server. As soon as the server is started, turn on the tape device.  
- Disable the device driver that's named TPFilter.sys.
