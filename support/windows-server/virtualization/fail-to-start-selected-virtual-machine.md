This article provides a solution to an error that occurs while you try to  start the selected virtual machine.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 2000800

## Symptoms

When trying to set the DVD drive for a Guest Machine running on Hyper-V Server to physical CD/ DVD drive, the following error is displayed after clicking Apply:

> Hyper-V Manager  
An error occurred while attempting to start the selected virtual machine(s).  
\<Guest Virtual Machine Name> failed to start.  
Microsoft Emulated IDE Controller (Instance ID  
{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}): Failed to power on with Error 'The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.'  
Failed to open attachment '\<Disk Drive> :'. Error 'The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.'

> [!Note]
> " X" represents an alpha/numeric value.

## Cause

The physical CD/DVD drive has already been mapped to another Guest Machine on the Hyper-V server.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue,  we must remove physical CD/DVD drive from an existing Guest Machine by changing the DVD setting to None or point to an ISO file
To accomplish this task perform the following steps:

1. Locate another Guest machine that is configured to use the Physical CD/DVD.
2. From Hyper-V manager, select settings, click on the DVD drive option under Hardware
3. In the right-hand pane,  under the **Media** option, choose either **NONE** or to an **Image File** as per user needs  
Or  
Open the Guest Machine, click on **Media** under media select **DVD drive** in the submenu select **Uncapture** \<Drive letter for DVD drive>.
