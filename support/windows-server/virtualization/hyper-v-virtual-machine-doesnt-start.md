# Hyper-V virtual machine doesn't start and triggers 0x80070057 error

This article provides a solution to a 0x80070057 error that occurs when you try to start a virtual machine.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3084322

## Symptoms  

Consider the following scenario:

- You have Hyper-V running on a Windows Server 2012 R2 or Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2012 R2-based server.
- You configure the virtual machines with pass-through disks.
- You install or upgrade to McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE) 8.8 Patch 5.

When you try to start a virtual machine in this scenario, it doesn't start, and the following error is returned:

> [Window Title]  
Hyper-V Manager
>
> [Main Instruction]  
An error occurred while attempting to start the selected virtual machine(s).

Attachment '\<SCSI ID>' failed to open because of error: 'One or more arguments are invalid'.

If you click **See details in the message window**, the following information is displayed:

## Cause

This is a known issue in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.8 Patch 5.

## Workaround

> [!WARNING]
>
> - This section contains information about opening or modifying the registry.
> - The following information is intended for system administrators. Registry modifications are irreversible and could cause system failure if done incorrectly.
> - Before you proceed, Intel Security strongly recommends that you back up your registry and understand the restore process. For more information, see [Windows registry information for advanced users](../performance/windows-registry-advanced-users.md).

To work around this issue, disable the mfedisk.sys driver in the registry:

1. Open Registry editor (regedit.exe).
2. Locate the following subkey:

    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}`

3. Modify the UpperFilters value by deleting "mfedisk" from this string.
4. Restart the computer.
