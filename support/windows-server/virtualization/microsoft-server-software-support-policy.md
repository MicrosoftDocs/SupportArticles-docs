# Microsoft server software and supported virtualization environments

This article discusses the support policy for running Microsoft server software in the following supported virtualization environments.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 957006

## Introduction

This article discusses the support policy for running Microsoft server software in the following supported virtualization environments:

- Windows Server 2008 and later versions with Hyper-V
- Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 and later versions
- Server Virtualization Validation Program (SVVP)

For more information, see [Windows Server Catalog](https://www.windowsservercatalog.com/).

Microsoft supports Microsoft server software that is running in the supported virtualization environments that are listed in the [More Information](#more-information) section. This support is subject to the Microsoft Support Lifecycle policy. For more information, see [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://support.microsoft.com/?pr=lifecycle).

In some cases, specific versions of Microsoft server software are required for support. These versions are noted in this article, and the supported versions may be updated as appropriate.

SVVP doesn't apply to vendors that are hosting Windows Server or other Microsoft products through the [Microsoft Service Provider License Agreement Program (SPLA)](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/existing-customer/existing-customers?rtc=1). Support for SPLA customers is provided under the SPLA agreement by the SPLA hoster. SPLA customers should contact their SPLA hoster for support.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all software applications are good candidates for running in a virtualized environment. For example, if an application has specific hardware requirements, such as access to a physical PCI card, the applications can't be supported in a virtual machine. This is true because virtual machines generally don't have access to underlying physical hardware.

## More information

The third-party products that this article discusses are manufactured by companies that are independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or otherwise, about the performance or reliability of these products.

Third parties are responsible for testing their software together with Microsoft software. Microsoft software may not work as intended in third-party virtualized hardware environments.
