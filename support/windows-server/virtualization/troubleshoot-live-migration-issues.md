## Summary

This article lists live migration issues in Windows Server 2016.

## Event ID 21502

### Information regarding Event ID 21502

#### Live migration failed because a virtual switch used by the VM doesn't exist on the destination node "Host2"

**Description**

Live migration of VM failed. VM failed to live migrate because a virtual switch used by the VM doesn't exist on the destination node "Host2".

**Action**

The virtual switch must have the same name on all nodes.  

If a virtual machine is connected to a virtual switch that doesn't exist on the destination node, then live migration fails at < 10%.

Give the virtual networks identical names. Refresh the virtual machine configuration so that network changes are reflected in cluster, and then try the live migration again.  

**Resolution**

Open the **Hyper-V Manager** console and select **Virtual Switch Manager**. If the virtual switch doesn't exist, create or rename it with the same name and settings such as in other hosts.

Make sure to select the correct virtual switch under the VM's settings.  

#### Live migration failed because the action "Move" didn't complete. Error Code: 0x80071398

**Description**

Live migration of VM failed.

**Action**

Right-click **virtual machine** > **Information details** > **Show details**. You see the following information:

The action "Move" didn't complete.

Error Code: 0x80071398

The operation failed because either the specified cluster node isn't the owner of the group, or the node isn't a possible owner of the group.

0x1398 5016 ERROR_HOST_NODE_NOT_GROUP_OWNER

 The operation failed because either the specified cluster node isn't the owner of the group, or the node isn't a possible owner of the group.  

**Resolution**

Open **Windows PowerShell** with **Run as administrator**, and run the following cmdlets:

- Get-clusterResource -name "Virtual Machine VM1" | Get-clusterOwnerNode
- Get-clusterResource -name "Virtual Machine Configuration VM1" | Get-clusterOwnerNode

The owner node must have all cluster nodes.

Alternatively, open the Failover Cluster Manager (FCM) under roles, select the virtual machine like shown in the following screenshot. On the bottom tab, select **Resource**, right-click **Virtual MachineVM1**, select the **Advanced Policies** tab. Check that all nodes are selected. Do the same for "**Virtual Machine Configuration VM1**. Make sure the VM has the same virtual switch on all nodes.

      2. Select the **Trust this computer for delegation to specified services only** and **Use any authentication protocol** options.
      3. Select **Add**, and select the computer account of another Hyper-V host.
      4. Add **cifs** (required to migrate storage) and **Microsoft Virtual System Migration Service** (required to migrate virtual machine).

Wait up to 15 minutes for Keberos tickets to time out. Or run the **KLIST PURGE -li 0x3e7** cmdlet.  

#### Failed to create Planned Virtual Machine at migration destination: Logon failure

**Description**

Live migration of "Virtual Machine VM name" failed.

Failed to create Planned Virtual Machine at migration destination: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer. (0x80070569)

Virtual Machines running on Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V hosts may fail to start. And you may receive an error message that's similar to the following example:

> Error 0x80070569 ("VM_NAME" failed to start worker process: Logon Failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.)  

**Action**

0x569 1385 ERROR_LOGON_TYPE_NOT_GRANTED

Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer

Besides, when you perform a recovery checkpoint and try to convert it to a reference point by using the ConvertToReferencePoint method, the conversion may fail. You may receive an error message that's similar to the following example:

> Failed to write VHD attachment "VHDX_NAME" to "VM_NAME": Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example, blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced. (0x8007052f)

0x52f 1327 ERROR_ACCOUNT_RESTRICTION Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blank passwords aren't allowed, sign-in times are limited, or a policy restriction has been enforced.

**Resolution**

#### Failed to establish a connection for a Virtual Machine migration with host "HOST3": A connection attempt failed

**Description**

The Virtual Machine Management Service failed to establish a connection for a Virtual Machine migration with host "HOST3": A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond. (0x8007274C).

**Action**

0x274c 10060 WSAETIMEDOUT

 A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.  

**Resolution**

Here's how to fix this issue:

1. Check for various corruptions of the **Registry.pol** under the **C:\Windows\System32\GroupPolicy\Machine** path.
2. Open the file in Notepad. It must start with the **`PReg`** signature.  

#### Fail to live migrate because the target principal name is incorrect. (0x80090322)  

**Description** 

The Virtual Machine Management Service failed to establish a connection for a Virtual Machine migration with host "HOST5": The target principal name is incorrect. (0x80090322).

**Action**

Migration was cross-cluster but as per Live Migration Network order, the private Network was selected.

0x80090322 -2146893022 SEC_E_WRONG_PRINCIPAL

 The target principal name is incorrect.  

**Resolution**

Change the Live Migration Network order for cross-cluster and change it back after the migration.  

#### Fail to live migrate because virtual machine migration operation for "VM01" failed at migration source "Node3"

**Description**

Live migration of "SCVMM VM01" failed

Virtual machine migration operation for "VM01" failed at migration source "Node3".

 The Virtual Machine Management Service initiated the live migration of virtual machine "VM01" to destination host "Node11."

**Action**

NetApp storage

Failed to get last write time of file "<\\\NetApp12\vol03\V01\Virtual Machines\D...17.VMRS>" with error 59! Returning cached write time.  

Failed to read configuration data in binary format from stream.  

HRESULT = 0x80048054  

 0x3b 59 ERROR_UNEXP_NET_ERR An unexpected network error occurred.  

**Resolution**

Enable or disable `oplocks` and lease `oplocks` on a `qtree`. If `oplocks` and lease `oplocks` are enabled at the storage system level, enable or disable `oplocks` and lease `oplocks` on an individual `qtree` by running the respective cmdlets:

- `qtree oplocks qtree_name enable`  
- `qtree oplocks qtree_name disable`

If the **cifs.oplocks.enable** option is set to **On**, the `qtree oplocks` cmdlet for a `qtree` takes effect immediately. If the **cifs.oplocks.enable** option is set to **Off**, the `qtree oplocks` command doesn't take effect until you change the option to **On**.

Here's how to fix this issue:

1. Replace the **NetApp** filer with a Windows 2016 based File server. Alternatively, update the **NetApp** file to the latest `Ontap` 9.*. version.
2. Make sure that the Windows Server 2016 based Hyper-V nodes are updated with the latest cumulative update. Similar issues are resolved after you applying [CU Feb 2019](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4487044/) or a later version.  

#### Failed live migration of 'Virtual Machine VM1' at migration source 'CLU8N1' with error codes 80042001 and 8007000D

**Description**

Live migration of 'Virtual Machine VM1' failed.

Virtual machine migration operation for 'VM1' failed at migration source 'CLU8N1'.  

 When running an SMB live migration between nodes in a Windows 2019 (RS5) Hyper-V cluster, a failure occurs on all VMs that point to a specific node:

Virtual machine migration operation for 'VM1' failed at migration source 'CLU8N1'.  

**Action**

Filter error codes 80042001 and 8007000D on the VM name to collect VML traces on the source.

Under RS5, live migration through SMB of all the VMs to a specific node fails on the source because the HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName: ComputerName isn't in UPPERCASE.  

**Resolution**

Make sure there's a REG_SZ value ComputerName with the name of the computer in UPPERCASE.

## Event ID 20413

**Description**

Live migration fails at 90%~100%, and quick migration fails during virtual machine configuration online.

**Action**

Nodes in cluster have different system drive letters assigned.

**Resolution**

On the destination node, the Hyper-V VMMS event displays the following error message:

The Virtual Machine Management Service failed to register the configuration for the virtual machine "\<vmID>" at "\<localpath>": The system cannot find the path.

 Set all nodes to use the same system driver letter on the cluster.  

## Event ID 20417

**Description**

The Virtual Machine Management service successfully completed the live migration of virtual machine "VM" with an unexpectedly long blackout time of 63.1 seconds.

**Action**

The message comes from a lower performance network when you try the live migration.

**Resolution**

Make sure there's enough bandwidth available for the live migration.  

Try to reduce the memory during the live migration. For more information, see [Virtual Machine Live Migration Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831435%28v=ws.11%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN).  

## Event ID 21024

**Description**

Both live migration and quick migration succeeds, but virtual machine loses network connectivity after migration.

**Action**

Virtual machine loses network connectivity after migration even though network settings are configured correctly.

**Resolution**

Make sure the virtual machine network settings are correct.

 Check if the source and destination virtual network are in the same subnet. If the aren't, run the **ipconfig /renew** cmdlet to resume the network connectivity. Alternatively, assign a new IP address to the virtual machine if a static IP address is used.  

## Event ID 21125

**Description**

Configuration setup for live migration failed on the destination node.

**Action**

Make sure that name of the virtual network is the same on the source and destination nodes and try the live migration again.

**Resolution**

Here's how to resolve this issue:  

1. Open the **Hyper-V Manager** console on the source and destination nodes.
2. Select **Virtual Network Manager**.
3. Verify if the virtual network names matched between source and destination nodes. Virtual switches must have the same name.
