# Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V host behavior running in the minroot configuration

This article describes the behavior that's specific to the Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V host Minimum Root (minroot) configuration. This article also provides links to more information about this behavior.

_Applies to:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2019

## More information

On a Windows Server Hyper-V host, the root partition (also known as the management partition) provides the management services that control all guest virtual machines (VMs), provides virtual device support for guests, and manages all device I/O for guest VMs. In systems that have many logical processors, Windows Server Hyper-V hosts run in a minroot configuration. In this configuration, the root partition is limited to a maximum of 320 logical processors, even if the host has more than 320 logical processors.

For more information about the minroot configuration, see [Hyper-V Host CPU Resource Management: Minroot](/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/manage/manage-hyper-v-minroot-2016#the-minimum-root-or-minroot-configuration).

When you run a Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V host in minroot configuration, you might observe the following behavior:

- **Processor performance management**. ACPI Collaborative Processor Performance Control (CPPC) is disabled on supported systems. Instead, the system relies on ACPI Performance (P) states for performance communication between the operating system and the hardware. To check your system's configuration, see the Kernel-Processor-Power (Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Processor-Power) event log. For more information about CPPC, see [Power and performance tuning: Processor performance boost mode](/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/hardware/power/power-performance-tuning#processor-performance-boost-mode).

- **Monitoring VM CPU workloads**. Task Manager on the Hyper-V host doesn't reflect the CPU usage of workloads that run within VMs. Instead, you can use the following counters in Performance Monitor on the Hyper-V host:

  - Logical Processor Utilization - \Hyper-V Hypervisor Logical Processor(*)\% Total Run Time
  - Virtual Processor Utilization - \Hyper-V Hypervisor Virtual Processor(*)\% Total Run Time

  For a general description of these performance counters, see [Detecting bottlenecks in a virtualized environment](/windows-server/administration/performance-tuning/role/hyper-v-server/detecting-virtualized-environment-bottlenecks). For a more detailed discussion about how to measure processor performance, see [Checklist: Measuring Performance on Hyper-V](/biztalk/technical-guides/checklist-measuring-performance-on-hyper-v). The method that the article describes applies to common workloads on VMs.
