# Computer record is rejected in MBAM

This article provides a solution to an issue where you receive a warning message "computer record is rejected" when using Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM).

When using Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring (MBAM) users may receive a Warning message stating, "Computer Record is Rejected" in the application logs on MBAM Server.

## Cause

This is a known issue with the product specified.

## Resolution

Follow steps below to create a new registry key on MBAM Server where you have MBAM Administration and Monitoring Server role installed.  

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, see [Windows registry information for advanced users](../performance/windows-registry-advanced-users.md).

1. Start Registry Editor.
2. Navigate to the registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft`.
3. On the **Edit** menu, click **New** > **Key**, and add the registry key value: MBAM.
4. Under the newly created registry key name, on the **Edit** menu, click **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value** and name it as DisableMachineVerification.
5. Set the value to 1.  
6. Exit Registry Editor.

After you make these changes, you must restart the MBAM server for the modifications to take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> The above registry key has nothing to do with hardware compatibility checking on the server and hardware compatibility check functionality still works as designed.
