## Cause

The above error occurs when the MBAM SSRS password that was used during MBAM setup wizard is changed or expired or the account is deleted from Active Directory.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, follow the steps from below:

1. Open web browser and go to `http://servername/Reports/Pages/Folder.aspx`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If your password is expired, then you might get an access denied error message when you try to open the above web page.  
    In this case, you will first have to connect to SQL Reporting Services using SQL Management Studio with your new password and you will be able to access the above webpage.

2. Click Microsoft BitLocker Administration and Monitoring.
3. Click **Malta Data Source** (see screenshot below).
