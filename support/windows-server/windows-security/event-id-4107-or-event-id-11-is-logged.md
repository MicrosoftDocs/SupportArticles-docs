Failed extract of third-party root list from auto update cab at: <http://www.download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/authrootstl.cab> with error: A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file.
```

## Cause

This error occurs because the Microsoft Certificate Trust List Publisher certificate expired. A copy of the CTL with an expired signing certificate exists in the CryptnetUrlCache folder.

## Resolution

To resolve the problem, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt. Select **Start**, select **All Programs**, select **Accessories**, and then select **Command Prompt**.

1. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:

    ```console
    certutil -urlcache * delete
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > The `certutil` command must be run for every user on the workstation. Each user must log in and follow steps 1 and 2 above.

1. If the expired certificate is cached in one of the local system profiles, you must delete the contents of some directories by using Windows Explorer. To do it, follow these steps:

   1. Start Windows Explorer. Select **Start**, select **All Programs**, select **Accessories**, and then select **Windows Explorer**.

        > [!NOTE]
        > You must enable hidden folders to view the directories whose contents you must delete. To enable hidden files and folders, follow these steps:
        >
        > 1. Select **Organize**, and then select Folder and search options.
        > 2. Select the **View** tab.
        > 3. Select the **Show hidden files and folders** check box.
        > 4. Clear the **Hide extensions for known file types** check box.
        > 5. Clear the **Hide protected operating system files** check box.
        > 6. Select **Yes** to dismiss the warning, and then select **OK** to apply the changes and to close the dialog box.

   1. Delete the contents of the directories that are listed here. (%windir% is the Windows directory.)

        > [!NOTE]
        > You may receive a message that states that you do not have permission to access the folder. If you receive this message, select **Continue**.

        `LocalService`:  
        %windir%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content  
        %windir%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\MetaData  

        `NetworkService`:  
        %windir%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content  
        %windir%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\MetaData

        `LocalSystem`:  
        %windir%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content  
        %windir%\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\MetaData

## More information

Event ID 4107 can also be logged with **The data is invalid** error instead of the following error:  

> A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file

This error **Data is invalid** indicates the object returned from the network wasn't a valid cab file. So Windows couldn't parse it correctly. Instances of such an error can occur when the network retrieval attempt for the cab file fails to go through a proxy. If the proxy returns some data or message instead of a standard HTTP error code, Windows will try to parse the message received from the proxy, expecting it to be the cab. This situation will fail with the **data is invalid** error.

To address this error, you need to remove the invalid entry in the cache by clearing the cache following the steps in the [Resolution](#resolution) section.
