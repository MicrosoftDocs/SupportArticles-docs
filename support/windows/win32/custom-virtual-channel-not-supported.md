# Remote Desktop in Microsoft Store doesn't support custom virtual channels

The Microsoft Store Remote Desktop app doesn't support custom virtual channels. This is a limitation of [Universal Windows Platform](/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) apps. To work around this issue, you can use Windows built-in Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc.exe) that supports custom virtual channels.
