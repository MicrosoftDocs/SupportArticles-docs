## Introduction of Windows Mobile Device Center

Microsoft Windows Mobile Device Center replaces ActiveSync for Windows Vista.

Windows Mobile Device Center offers device management and data synchronization between a Windows Mobile-based device and a computer.

For Windows XP or earlier operating systems, you must use Microsoft ActiveSync.

## How to use Windows Mobile Device Center

Download and install Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 if you run Windows Vista on your computer and you want to sync content between your mobile phone and your computer. Windows Mobile Device Center is compatible only with Windows Vista.

> If you run Windows XP or an earlier version of Windows, you have to download Microsoft ActiveSync.

You can use Windows Mobile Device Center 6.1 only with phones that run Windows Mobile 2003 or a later version. ActiveSync and Windows Mobile Device Center do not work with Windows Embedded CE 4.2 or 5.0, Pocket PC 2002, or Smartphone 2002 devices.

To determine which Windows Mobile operating system you're using if your phone doesn't have a touch screen, click **Start**, click **Settings**, and then click **About**.

If your phone has a touch screen, tap **Start**, tap the **System** tab, and then tap **About**. To sync content to any of these devices, you must use a USB or serial cable, your computer's Internet connection, and File Explorer.

## Device is disconnected when syncing large files

If you have problems syncing music, pictures, or other large files in which the connection suddenly closes, there may be an issue with a serial driver that is installed on the device. Unless you are using a VPN server or a firewall that is blocking your large files from synchronization, you may try switching your device into RNDIS mode to fix your large file sync problem. If your device has a **USB to PC** option, you might use this workaround:

1. On the device, go to **Settings** and then **Connections**. Look for a **USB to PC** option.
1. To enable RNDIS USB, select the **Enable advanced network functionality** check box in the **USB to PC** options, and then tap **OK**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If this option is already selected, do not clear this selection or this workaround will not work.

1. Warm-boot the device. To do this, hold down the power button and then press the reset button, or remove the battery.
1. Turn on the device.
1. When the device is restarted, dock the device and try again.

    > [!NOTE]
    > RNDIS takes a little while to connect. Please be patient and wait for the device to connect.

1. If, after you follow the previous steps, you cannot connect at all, just switch back to serial USB to sync.
