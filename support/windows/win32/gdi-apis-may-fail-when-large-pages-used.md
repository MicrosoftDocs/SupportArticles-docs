# GDI APIs fail when large pages or VAD spanning are used

This article introduces that GDI APIs fails when large pages or Virtual Address Descriptors (VAD) spanning are used.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4567569

When large page sizes are configured for virtual memory allocations and/or when buffers spanning multiple VAD are passed to the GDI APIs listed below, the function calls fail.

> [!NOTE]
> VAD-spanning can occur if memory management facilities such as heap managers and/or garbage collectors request contiguous virtual address ranges(each of which has its own VAD), but attempts to use them as a single block of memory.
