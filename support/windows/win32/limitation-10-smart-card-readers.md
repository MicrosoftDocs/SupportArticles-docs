# Limitation of 10 smartcard readers in Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8, and later

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows Server 2012 and later versions, Windows 8 and later versions  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 3144446

Starting in Windows 8, the Windows platform supports a maximum of 10 smartcard readers. If more than 10 smartcard readers are available, APIs such as `SCardListReaders` return a maximum of 10. All other readers are ignored.

Although the Smart Card APIs never enforce a reader limit, some parts of the system are limited to 10 smartcard readers. This sometimes causes sporadic errors when `SCard` APIs are used over terminal server redirection. There are also some performance issues that occur in this situation. To resolve these issues, a limit of 10 smartcard is built into the APIs and other parts of the code. This makes it consistent with the whole smartcard stack.
