# Page setup dialog might unexpectedly close after the print support app is installed

## Symptoms

Consider the following scenario:

- You're using Windows 10, version 22H2.
- You're developing a print support app (PSA) for IPP-based printers.
- You're using the Notepad or Paint application.

In this scenario, after you install the PSA on the system, toggling the page orientation setting might cause the host application to crash. For example, in *notepad.exe*, you can see the issue in the **Page Setup** dialog, as shown in the following screenshot.
