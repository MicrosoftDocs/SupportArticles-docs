# PathIsDirectory function may be blocked when called by using a UNC server name with a trailing backslash

This article helps you resolve the problem where the `PathIsDirectory` function may be blocked when it is called by applications that use a UNC server name that has a trailing backslash.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Windows SDK for Windows 10  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 4525162

## Symptoms

Applications that call the `PathIsDirectory` function may block the calling thread for up to two minutes when they make the call by using a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) server name that has a trailing backslash, for example: `\\servername\`.

## Cause

An application that is blocking a calling thread in a `PathIsDirectory` call may have a call stack that resembles the following:

> 0:000> kn  
\# Child-SP          RetAddr           Call Site  
00 0000006f`3b59f108 00007ffc`94f48ba3 ntdll!ZwWaitForSingleObject+0x14

0d 0000006f`3b59f7d0 00007ff7`226f292e SHLWAPI!PathIsDirectoryW+0x60fc

This occurs when the `WNetGetResourceInformation` function is called to obtain information about the specified server. In this call stack, the Web DAV network provider DLL (DAVCLNT.DLL) blocks the calling thread while it waits for the specified server to respond to an HTTP request. This operation may take up to two minutes to time out. The calling thread will be blocked until the server responds to the HTTP request or until the request times out.

## Resolution

Applications can avoid this scenario if you remove the trailing backslash in the UNC name before **PathIsDirectory** is called, as this: `\\servername`.

Alternatively, to avoid the delay in the HTTP request that is made by the Web DAV network provider, either disable the WebClient service or configure the service to start automatically.
