# Use the DnsQuery function to resolve host names and host addresses with Visual C++ .NET

This article provides a Win32 console application sample that illustrates how to use the `DnsQuery` function to resolve host names and host IP.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; Winsock  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 831226

## Create a sample Win32 console application that illustrates how to use the DnsQuery function

In Winsock, use the `getaddrinfo` function instead of the `getaddrbyname` function to host names in your application. The `getaddrbyname` function was replaced by the `getaddrinfo` function to handle IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.

Winsock never accounted for wide characters until recently in Windows Server 2003 where a new version of the `getaddrinfo` function is included. The new version is named *GetAddrInfo*. If you need a solution for all NT-based operating systems, use the DNS client DNSQuery function to resolve host names. The `DNSQuery` function has a wide version that should work on Microsoft Windows 2000 and later operating systems.

Use the following steps to create a sample Win32 console application that illustrates how to use the `DnsQuery` function. The `DnsQuery` function sends a query to a DNS server to resolve the host name to an IP address and vice-versa.

1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.
2. Under **Project Types**, click **Visual C++ Projects**, and then click **Win32 Project** under
 **Templates**.
3. Type Q831226 in the **Name** box.
4. In the Win32 Application wizard, click **Console Application**, click **Empty project**, and then click
 **Finish**.
5. In Solution Explorer, right-click **Source Files**, click **Add**, and then click **Add New Item**. Add a C++ file (.cpp) to the project. Name the file *Q831226.cpp*.
6. Paste the following code in the *Q831226.cpp* file:

    ```cpp
    #include <winsock2.h> //winsock
    #include <windns.h> //DNS api's
    #include <stdio.h> //standard i/o
    
    //Usage of the program
    void Usage(char *progname) {
        fprintf(stderr,"Usage\n%s -n [HostName|IP Address] -t [Type] -s [DnsServerIp]\n",progname);
        fprintf(stderr,"Where:\n\t\"HostName|IP Address\" is the name or IP address of the computer ");
        fprintf(stderr,"of the record set being queried\n");
        fprintf(stderr,"\t\"Type\" is the type of record set to be queried A or PTR\n");
        fprintf(stderr,"\t\"DnsServerIp\"is the IP address of DNS server (in dotted decimal notation)");
        fprintf(stderr,"to which the query should be sent\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    
    void ReverseIP(char* pIP)
    {
        char seps[] = ".";
        char *token;
        char pIPSec[4][4];
        int i=0;
        token = strtok( pIP, seps);
        while( token != NULL )
        {
            /* While there are "." characters in "string"*/
            sprintf(pIPSec[i],"%s", token);
            /* Get next "." character: */
            token = strtok( NULL, seps );
            i++;
        }
        sprintf(pIP,"%s.%s.%s.%s.%s", pIPSec[3],pIPSec[2],pIPSec[1],pIPSec[0],"IN-ADDR.ARPA");
    }

7. On the **Project** menu, click **Properties**.
8. In the **Project Properties** dialog box, expand **Linker** under **Configuration Properties**, click **Command Line**, and then add the following libraries to the **Additional Options** box:

   - Ws2_32.lib
   - Dnsapi.lib
9. Press Ctrl+Shift+B to build the solution.

## Test the sample

- Find the IP address that corresponds to the host name:
`Q831226.exe -n <hostname> -t A -s <IP address of DNS server>`  

    > [!NOTE]
    > **hostname** is the placeholder of the name of the computer that is being queried.

- Find the host name that corresponds to the IP address:
`Q831226.exe -n <xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx> -t PTR -s <IP address of DNS server>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > **xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx** is a placeholder of the IP address of the computer that is being queried.
